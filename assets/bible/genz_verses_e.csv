Daniel,9,12,"And like, dude totally made good on everything he said he would do, you know? He's straight up called out our judges and us for our wrongs and now we're facing some legit serious consequences. Like, no joke, what's happening to Jerusalem right now ain't been seen anywhere else in this whole world, it's heavy stuff."
Daniel,9,13,"As it says in the law of Moses, all this bad stuff has happened to us: but we didn't even bother praying to the LORD our God, asking for forgiveness and trying to understand your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"So, the LORD was like low-key keeping an eye on all the bad stuff going down and made sure it happened to us, 'cause our God straight up does what's right in everything He does. We played ourselves by ignoring His voice, tho."
Daniel,9,15,"Yo, Almighty God, who totally delivered your peeps from Egypt in a badass way and made a name for yourself, like, right now we're real sorry, we messed up big time. We've done some seriously messed up stuff."
Daniel,9,16,"Yo, God, I'm praying to you, asking that you chill out and let go of your anger and rage towards Jerusalem, your sacred spot. The city and its people have become a total embarrassment because of our sins and the messed up things our ancestors did. Everybody's talking smack about us, and it's not cool."
Daniel,9,17,"Yo, God! Please listen to the prayer of your faithful servant and hear their requests. Let your light shine on your sanctuary that's all messed up, all for the sake of the Lord."
Daniel,9,18,"Yo God, listen up and pay attention. Open your eyes and check out the messed up stuff happening to our city, which is known by your name. We're not asking for help because we're so good, but because we know you're full of mercy."
Daniel,9,19,"Yo, God, listen up; Yo, God, forgive; Yo, God, pay attention and take action; don't wait, for your sake, my dude: 'cause your city and your peeps are repping your name."
Daniel,9,20,"So, like, I was in the middle of talking and praying, you know? I was confessing my own mistakes and the mistakes of the people of Israel, and I was making this request to the LORD my God, asking for some serious blessings for His sacred dwelling place on the holy mountain. It was a whole vibe."
Daniel,9,21,"So, like, while I was praying and stuff, suddenly Gabriel, the angel dude I had seen in a vision before, like, zoomed in super fast and caught up with me around sunset. And I gotta say, he seemed pretty tired from all that flying!"
Daniel,9,22,"And he hit me up, and we chatted, and he was like, 'Yo, Daniel, I'm here to hook you up with mad skills and knowledge. Like, I'm gonna make you hella smart, you know."
Daniel,9,23,"When you started praying, the order was given, and I'm here to explain it to you because you're super important to me. So, pay attention and think about what you've seen."
Daniel,9,24,"So, listen up! Here's the deal: Seventy weeks have been set aside for your peeps and the holy city. It's time to put an end to all the wrongdoings, reconcile the mistakes, and bring in that eternal goodness. Oh, and let's not forget about sealing up the visions and prophecies, and anointing the holiest of holies. #Blessed"
Daniel,9,25,"So here's the deal, you gotta know and understand that from the moment the command is given to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the arrival of the Messiah (aka the ultimate boss), there will be a total of seven weeks plus sixty-two weeks. During that time, the streets will be rebuilt and the walls will be restored, even in challenging and tough times. Trust, it's gonna happen."
Daniel,9,26,"And like, after sixty-two weeks, the Messiah will be totally taken out, but not for himself, you know? And the folks of this prince who's gonna show up are gonna totally wreck the city and the sacred place, and it's gonna be like a total flood, man. And there's gonna be non-stop desolation until the end of the war. No joke, it's gonna be a real mess, you feel?"
Daniel,9,27,"And he will make a solid agreement with many for seven years. But in the middle of that time, he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings. He will spread evil things and make everything a mess until the end comes. And what has been planned will happen, bringing destruction to all."
Daniel,10,1,"In like, the third year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, this super legit thing got dropped on Daniel (aka Belteshazzar). And yo, this thing was straight up true, but it was gonna take a hot minute for it to go down. And Daniel, he had the smarts to get it and fully comprehend the vision, no cap. {long: Hebrew for great}"
Daniel,10,2,"So like, during that time, I, Daniel, was like super sad for a whole three weeks. Like, not just regular weeks, but weeks with days and stuff. You know?"
Daniel,10,3,"I didn't have any fancy food, no meat or wine passed through my lips, and I didn't even put on any fancy fragrances, until three whole weeks went by."
Daniel,10,4,"So, it was like April 24th, and I was chilling by this big river called Hiddekel."
Daniel,10,5,"So like, I like turned my gaze up and saw this totally rad dude wearing like, designer linen clothes and a sick gold belt. It was like, golden goodness from Uphaz, you know?"
Daniel,10,6,"Yo, this guy's whole vibe was like beryl, his face was literally lit up like lightning, his eyes were flames, and his arms and feet were shinin' like polished brass. And when he spoke, it was like a whole crowd speaking at once, no cap."
Daniel,10,7,"So, it was just me, Daniel, who saw this epic vision. None of the other dudes that were with me saw it, but it was so mind-blowing that they got seriously shook and dipped to find some hiding spots."
Daniel,10,8,"So, like, I was totally on my own, and then I had this insane vision, but honestly, I couldn't even handle it because I was so wiped out. I went from being all strong and confident to feeling totally drained and, like, everything about me just felt gross and weak. (BTW, when I say 'comeliness,' I basically mean my whole vibe and energy, ya know? Just to clear things up.)"
Daniel,10,9,"But then I totally heard what he was saying, and, like, when I heard his words, I was, like, in this super intense nap, just face-planted on the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"Yo, check it out, this crazy thing happened: all of a sudden, someone's hand grabbed me and placed me on my knees, and also on the palms of my hands. It was like they moved me or something, you know?"
Daniel,10,11,"Yo, Daniel, my dude, listen up! Understand what I'm about to tell you and stand tall, 'cause I'm here for you. When he said that to me, I was straight up shaking in my boots."
Daniel,10,12,"And he was like, 'Don't stress, Daniel! Like, ever since you made the effort to understand and be all humble before God, He totally heard your words, and I'm here because of them."
Daniel,10,13,"So, like, there was this prince from Persia who challenged me for a whole 21 days. But guess what? Michael, one of the top princes, swooped in to lend a hand and I stayed there chilling with the Persian kings. #TeamMichael"
Daniel,10,14,"Yo, I'm here to give you the lowdown on what's gonna go down with your peeps in the future. This vision's gonna be relevant for a hot minute, so pay attention."
Daniel,10,15,"And when he said that to me, I looked down and couldn't say a word."
Daniel,10,16,"So, like, this dude who looked human just appeared and touched my lips. And then I was like, okay, and I opened my mouth and spoke to the guy standing in front of me. I was all like, yo, dude, this vision has totally messed me up and now I'm weak af."
Daniel,10,17,"Like, how can I, being just a servant, even have a conversation with my lord, right? I mean, as for me, I instantly felt totally exhausted and couldn't even catch my breath. No strength left in me, dude."
Daniel,10,18,"And then this person came up to me, looking like a normal dude, and gave me a boost of confidence."
Daniel,10,19,"And he was like, 'Yo, dude I really like you a lot, so don't be afraid, everything's chill. Be confident, like super confident. And after he told me that, I felt so empowered and was like, 'Go ahead and speak, my lord, you've given me so much strength!'"
Daniel,10,20,"Yo, listen up. Do you even know the reason why I came to you? I'm about to bounce and go fight the prince of Persia. But check it, once I'm done, guess who's rolling in? Yup, the prince of Grecia will come through."
Daniel,10,21,"But I'll give you the lowdown straight from the holy script: nobody else is down with what I'm about except for Michael, your main dude. He's got my back in all of this, no doubt."
Daniel,11,1,"So, like, in the first year when Darius the Mede was doing his thing, I was totally there to support and empower him, you know?"
Daniel,11,2,"So, here's what's gonna go down: Pay attention, there's gonna be three kings in Persia, and then the fourth one is gonna be crazy rich, like way richer than the rest. With all that power and wealth, he's gonna cause some serious trouble for the kingdom of Grecia."
Daniel,11,3,"And a total boss king is gonna step up, flexing his power and doing whatever he wants."
Daniel,11,4,"And when he finally rises up, his kingdom will crumble, splitting apart in every direction; not being passed down to his descendants, and his rule will not continue. His kingdom will be uprooted, given to others beside his own."
Daniel,11,5,"And the king of the south will be a total boss, along with one of his top dudes; and he's gonna be even stronger than the rest and totally rule the kingdom - like, he's gonna have a super huge kingdom and no one can mess with him!"
Daniel,11,6,"And after many years, they will form an alliance; for the daughter of the southern king will come to the northern king to make a deal. But her influence will not last, nor will he or his power. Instead, she will be betrayed along with those who supported and raised her during this period."
Daniel,11,7,"But from her family lineage, a bold leader will emerge, ready to gather their squad and conquer the kingdom of the north. They will face their adversaries head-on, coming out victorious in the end."
Daniel,11,8,"And they will even take their gods, along with their leaders, and their valuable silver and gold belongings, as captives into Egypt. This will happen for several more years than the king of the north will rule."
Daniel,11,9,"So, like, the king of the south is gonna flex in his kingdom and then bounce back to his turf."
Daniel,11,10,"But his sons will get all hyped up and gather a massive army: and one of them will totally show up and dominate, and go right through: then they'll come back, all fired up, back to their stronghold."
Daniel,11,11,"The king of the south will totally lose it and go all out to fight with the king of the north. He'll gather a huge army, but in the end, the king of the north will totally crush them."
Daniel,11,12,"And once he's removed all those people, he'll get all high and mighty, and he'll throw down tens of thousands; but it won't make him any stronger."
Daniel,11,13,"Yo, the king of the north is gonna make a comeback, and he's gonna bring an even bigger crew than before. It's gonna go down after some time with a crazy huge army and mad stacks of riches. Like, we're talking end of times and stuff, you know, even years later."
Daniel,11,14,"During those times, there will be numerous individuals who oppose the southern ruler. The troublemakers among your people will also try to take control and fulfill their own agenda, but they will ultimately fail."
Daniel,11,15,"So like the king from the north is gonna roll up and build a sick fortress and capture the strongest cities. The peeps from the south won't even stand a chance, including his chosen crew, like no one will have the power to resist. It's gonna be like a major showdown."
Daniel,11,16,"But whoever opposes him will do as they please, and no one will be able to resist them. They will take control of the awesome land, which they will conquer with their own power. {awesome...: or, beautiful, etc.: original Hebrew text says landd of ornament'}"
Daniel,11,17,"He's gonna make a strong entrance with his whole squad, including some righteous peeps. Here's the plan: he's gonna hook up with this fine lady, but she's not gonna have his back or support him. It's like a sketchy setup that won't work out in his favor."
Daniel,11,18,"Once he's done with that, he'll shift his attention to the islands and conquer many of them. However, a cunning leader will arise and end the disgrace brought about by the first one; he'll cleverly turn the tables on him without facing any disgrace himself."
Daniel,11,19,"And he'll totally flex on his own turf, but like, oopsies, he'll trip and eat it, and he won't be able to recover. It's a total L, dude."
Daniel,11,20,"Next, there will come someone who will be all about those taxes, shining in the glory of the kingdom. But guess what? It won't be long before they get wiped out, and not because of anger or a battle. It's gonna be quick and unexpected, ya know?"
Daniel,11,21,"And this person, who isn't very cherished by others, will rise to power. They won't be given the royal treatment, but they'll come in a non-threatening way and win over the kingdom with smooth talk."
Daniel,11,22,"They'll be overwhelmed like a massive wave and defeated, even the leader who made a promise."
Daniel,11,23,"And after they make an agreement with him, he's gonna be all sneaky about it: 'cuz he's gonna rise up and gain power with just a small crew."
Daniel,11,24,"He will smoothly take control even of the most prosperous areas; he will do things that no one in his ancestry has ever done before. He will distribute among them wealth, plunder, and riches. Furthermore, he will strategize against mighty fortresses for a while."
Daniel,11,25,"And he's gonna flex his power and courage on the king of the south, rollin' in with a massive army. The king of the south gonna get all riled up and bring his own huge and mighty army into the fight. But he ain't gonna stand a chance, 'cause they gonna plot and scheme against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Like, those who consume his food will totally betray him, and his squad will be, like, totally outnumbered: lots of them will, like, tragically perish."
Daniel,11,27,"And these two kings will totally be up to no good, like seriously! They'll be sitting at the same table, telling all sorts of lies, but guess what? Their wicked plans won't even succeed, 'cause sooner or later, it's all gonna come to an end, exactly when it's supposed to. (BTW, hearts means their hearts, just FYI)"
Daniel,11,28,"Afterward, he will go back to his own country with a load of cash and he will be totally against the sacred agreement. He'll pull off some pretty bold moves and head back to his turf."
Daniel,11,29,"At the appointed time, he'll make a comeback and head south, but it won't be like before or after."
Daniel,11,30,"Yo, these Chittim ships gonna come at him and it's gonna mess him up big time. You know what's gonna happen? He's gonna get all upset and angry, breaking his promise to God. And get this, he's actually gonna team up with those who also turned their backs on the holy covenant. Can you believe it?"
Daniel,11,31,"And some peeps will support him, and they'll totally mess up the sacred place, and they'll stop the regular stuff they do there, and they'll replace it with something super messed up that just ruins everything. (or, like, super amazes but not in a good way)"
Daniel,11,32,"Those who act wickedly and break the covenant will be influenced and deceived by false compliments, but those who have a deep connection with their God will have inner strength and accomplish great things."
Daniel,11,33,"Those who are woke among the squad will educate many, but they will suffer defeat in battles, fiery trials, imprisonment, and loss for many days."
Daniel,11,34,"So like, if they stumble, they'll get some backup, but then a bunch of people will just start sucking up to them."
Daniel,11,35,"And some of the wise ones will stumble, to test their faith and cleanse them, and make them shine until the end of time, as it is destined to be. (test their faith: or, test through them)"
Daniel,11,36,"So like, the king is gonna do whatever he wants and totally boost his own ego, acting all high and mighty like he's better than any other god. He'll even say some unbelievable stuff against the one true God. And he'll actually succeed for a while, but eventually, his arrogance will catch up with him. You see, everything that's supposed to happen will totally go down as planned."
Daniel,11,37,"He won't care about his ancestors' God or have any interest in women, and he'll have no respect for any gods. Instead, he'll only care about making himself look superior to everyone else."
Daniel,11,38,"But instead, he will glorify the God of power and strength, honoring a deity that his ancestors were unfamiliar with, offering up gold, silver, precious stones, and all things desirable as a tribute."
Daniel,11,39,"So he's gonna do the same thing in fortified places with a different god, whom he'll recognize and make powerful. He's gonna make them rule over many and divide up the land to make some profit."
Daniel,11,40,"And when it's almost over, the southern king will challenge the northern king head on, and the northern king will come at him full force like a tornado, with chariots, horsemen, and a massive fleet of ships. He will invade lands, conquer territories, and spread far and wide."
Daniel,11,41,"He's gonna take over the awesome place and a bunch of other places are gonna get messed up, but certain places like Edom, Moab, and the important peeps from Ammon will manage to avoid his grasp. (By the way, when it says 'glorious land' it means like a super cool, fancy, and beautiful place)"
Daniel,11,42,"He's gonna flex on all the countries, and Egypt won't be able to slip away. #NoEscape"
Daniel,11,43,"But he's gonna have mad control over all the gold, silver, and super valuable stuff in Egypt. And even the Libyans and Ethiopians will be vibing with him."
Daniel,11,44,"But news from the east and the north will disturb him, so he'll get super furious and go all out to destroy and get rid of a lot of people."
Daniel,11,45,"And he's gonna set up his sweet crib on the mountain that's, like, totally holy and impressive, surrounded by two big seas. But eventually, he's gonna meet his demise, and no one's gonna be able to save his sorry self. {goodly...: or, super rad, etc.: Heb. mountain of ultimate awesomeness}"
Daniel,12,1,"Yo, when that time comes, Michael, the OG prince who's got our back, gonna step up. It's gonna be a legit crazy period, like nothing we've ever seen before, like for real, since the beginning of nations up until that very moment. But don't trip, 'cause when that time comes, all our peeps who are on the authorized list gonna be saved and delivered, no doubt."
Daniel,12,2,"A lot of those who are snoozin' in the dirt are gonna wake up, dude. Some will have the raddest life ever, while others gonna feel hella ashamed and disrespected forever, man."
Daniel,12,3,And those who are wise will glow like the coolest stars in the sky; and those who inspire many to do good will shine like forever-famous stars.
Daniel,12,4,"But yo, Daniel, keep the words on the DL and lock up the book until the end times: mad peeps gonna be jet-setting everywhere, and knowledge gonna be off the charts."
Daniel,12,5,"So I, Daniel, checked it out and saw two other beings, one on each side of the riverbank. They were just chilling there, taking in the view. Oh, and FYI, 'bank' in Hebrew means 'lip'. We talkin' about riverbanks here, not money stuff. Just thought you should know. *peace sign emoji*"
Daniel,12,6,"And someone asked the guy dressed in cool linen, who was chilling on the river, like, how much longer until all these amazing things come to an end? Like, from up above and stuff."
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the guy in fancy clothes, standing on the river, lifting both his hands up to the sky and making a big promise. He swore by the One who lives forever that something's gonna happen for a specific period of time. After he's done messing with the power of the holy people, everything will be done and dusted."
Daniel,12,8,"I was listening, but I didn't get it: so I asked, Yo, my Lord, what's gonna happen in the end?"
Daniel,12,9,"And he was like, 'Yo, Daniel, just chill for now, 'cause these words are all locked up and sealed tight until the end times, you feel me?"
Daniel,12,10,"Like, a bunch of people will, like, totally level up and go through some intense stuff, while the wicked ones will just keep being wicked. And, like, none of those wicked peeps will even get it, but the wise ones, yo, they'll totally get it."
Daniel,12,11,"And when they stop the daily sacrifice and set up something detestable that causes devastation, there will be 1,290 days until it ends and things go back to normal. The detestable thing will shock everyone."
Daniel,12,12,Happy is the one who patiently waits and reaches the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five day milestone.
Daniel,12,13,"Just keep doing your thing until it's all over, because eventually you'll get some well-deserved rest and receive what's coming to you at the end of it all."
Hosea,1,1,"Yo, listen up! This is the message God dropped on Hosea, the son of Beeri, back in the day when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah were in chargein Judah, and Jeroboam the son of Joash was reigning in Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"This is how it all started, the message from the LORD through Hosea. The LORD told Hosea, 'Dude, go find yourself a wife who's all about that 'do whatever you want' lifestyle, and have kids who are all about that too. Because the people in this land have totally ditched the LORD and gone astray.'"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and started dating Gomer, who is the daughter of Diblaim. And guess what? She got pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy for him."
Hosea,1,4,"And God was like, yo, name him Jezreel 'cause in a bit, I'm gonna make things right for the bloodshed in Jezreel by punishing the house of Jehu and putting an end to the kingdom of Israel. #justice"
Hosea,1,5,"And it's gonna go down, like for real, on that day, when I'm gonna totally wreck Israel's weapon in the Jezreel Valley."
Hosea,1,6,"Then she got pregnant again and gave birth to a baby girl. And {God} told him, name her Loruhamah: because I'm not gonna show any more mercy to the people of Israel; I'm gonna completely get rid of them. {Loruhamah: which means, Not receiving mercy} {no...: in Hebrew, it means no more} {but...: or, for me to forgive them completely}"
Hosea,1,7,"But I've got mad love for the fam of Judah, and I'm gonna save them with the big guy upstairs, not with weapons like bows, swords, or war horses."
Hosea,1,8,"After Loruhamah was no longer breastfed, she got pregnant and gave birth to a son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then God said, name him Loammi: because you aren't my people and I won't be your God. Loammi means 'Not my people'."
Hosea,1,10,"But check this, the squad of Israel is gonna be legit vast, like way more than you can even count. And get this, in places where people straight up said, ‘Nah, you ain't one of us,’ they gonna be like, ‘Bruh, you be chillin' with the Most High, His own fam.’"
Hosea,1,11,"And all the homies from Judah and Israel will link up, choose one leader for themselves, and bounce out of this place. Oh, you best believe it's gonna be lit, the day of Jezreel gonna be off the charts."
Hosea,2,1,"Tell your squad, 'We're tight'; and to your girls, 'We've got each other's backs'. {Tight: that's like being with your crew} {We've got each other's backs: that's like showing mercy}"
Hosea,2,2,"Yo, talk to your mom, I'm serious: ‘Cause she ain't my wifey, and I'm not her hubby either. She needs to kick her thotty behavior to the curb, along with all the cheating shenanigans. Like, seriously, get rid of that mess!"
Hosea,2,3,"I won't expose her and make her vulnerable like when she was born, I won't turn her into a desolate place, dry and lifeless, and won't let her die of thirst."
Hosea,2,4,And I won't show any mercy to her kids; 'cause they're the children of sinful behavior.
Hosea,2,5,"So, like, their mom did some messed up stuff, you know? She went out and messed around with other guys and did some embarrassing stuff. She was all like, 'I'm gonna chase after my lovers who provide me with everything I need - food, water, clothes, oil, and drinks.'"
Hosea,2,6,"So like, check it out, I'm gonna block your path with a bunch of thorns and build a wall, so you won't be able to find your way. You know, like a solid wall and stuff."
Hosea,2,7,"And she's gonna be chasing after her crushes, but she won't catch up to them; and she's gonna be searching for them, but won't find 'em, you know? Then she's gonna be like, 'I'm gonna go back to my ex-husband, 'cause back in the day, it was way better than how things are now.'"
Hosea,2,8,"She had no idea that I was the one who hooked her up with the latest drip of corn, wine, and oil, and made her stack up her paper and bling, all of which she wasted on that Baal lifestyle."
Hosea,2,9,"So, I'm gonna go back and reclaim my crops when it's time, and get back what I gave her to stay covered."
Hosea,2,10,"And now I'm about to expose her foolishness and wickedness in front of all her lovers, and there won't be anyone who can save her from my grasp."
Hosea,2,11,"I'm gonna cancel all her lit parties, celebrations, monthly hangouts, chill Saturdays, and all her epic festivities."
Hosea,2,12,"And I'll totally wreck her fancy vines and fig trees, the ones she proudly claims as gifts from her lovers. I'll turn them into a legit forest and let the wild beasts munch on 'em. #obliterated"
Hosea,2,13,"And I'll bring upon her the days when she was all into idol worship, burning incense and accessorizing with fancy bling. She was all about chasing after her lovers, completely forgetting about me, says the LORD."
Hosea,2,14,"Yo, check this out. I'm gonna charm her, take her to the wild, and speak to her in a chill way. (or, you know, like a good friend: in a way that resonates with her)"
Hosea,2,15,"And I'll hook her up with some bomb vineyards and the sick valley of Achor as a rad opportunity for hope. She'll be rocking it there, singing her heart out like back in the good old days of her youth, just like when she first escaped from Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"Yo, when that day comes, says the LORD, you gonna call me 'Bae' instead of 'My Lord'. 'Bae' meaning 'My husband', by the way, and 'My Lord' meaning 'My lord'."
Hosea,2,17,"I'm straight up erasing all the Baalim names from their vocab, like they'll never even be remembered."
Hosea,2,18,"And like, on that day, I'm gonna make a dope agreement for them with the animals of the field, the birds in the sky, and even the creepy crawlies on the ground, you know? And I'll totally get rid of all the violence and wars, smashing the weapons and making everyone just chill and feel safe."
Hosea,2,19,"And I'll commit to you forever; yes, I'll commit to you with righteousness, fairness, kindness, and compassion."
Hosea,2,20,I'm totally gonna commit to you with loyalty and you'll totally get to know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"Yo, on that day, I'm telling ya, I'll be all ears, says the LORD. The heavens will be tuned in, and even the earth will be heard."
Hosea,2,22,"And, like, the earth will totally thrive with crops, and, like, grapes for wine, and olive trees for oil; and they'll be blessed like, Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I'm gonna plant her right here on earth; showing some serious love to those who weren't shown any love before. I'll tell those who weren't considered part of my crew: 'Yo, you're totally one of my peeps now!' And they'll be like, 'You're my legit God, bro!'"
Hosea,3,1,"So the LORD told me, 'Go and love a girl who is loved by someone else, even though she cheats on him. This is how much the LORD loves the people of Israel, who chase after other gods and enjoy partying with wine."
Hosea,3,2,"So I copped her for fifteen silver coins, a bunch of barley, and half a bunch of barley. Ya feel me?"
Hosea,3,3,"And I told her, you gotta stick with me for a while, no messing around with anyone else, and I'll be loyal to you too."
Hosea,3,4,"Yo, the kids of Israel gonna be on their own for a hot minute, no king, no prince, no sacrifices, no statues, no fancy priest robes, and definitely no idol worship. Just straight up without all that stuff, ya feel me?"
Hosea,3,5,"Later on, the Israelite squad gonna bounce back and start searching for the Almighty, their homie God, and their boy David, who's their king. They gonna show some serious respect for the LORD and all the dope stuff He's got going on in the future."
Hosea,4,1,"Listen up, all you peeps of Israel! The Lord's got some serious beef with the folks living in this land. It's like, there's no honesty, compassion, or even a basic understanding of God around here."
Hosea,4,2,"Like, these people, man, they're out here doing all sorts of messed up stuff. They're swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and cheating on their partners. It's like chaos, bro. They keep causing more harm, and it's the same cycle repeating over and over again. It's like they're just adding fuel to the fire, you know?"
Hosea,4,3,"So like, the land gonna be sad and everyone living there gonna feel down, including the animals in the field, the birds in the sky, and even the fish in the sea gonna disappear, man."
Hosea,4,4,"But like, don't even bother arguing or calling out other people, 'cause seriously, our crew is just like always butting heads with the clergy and stuff."
Hosea,4,5,"So, like, you're gonna totally bite it during the day, and even the so-called prophet will eat it with you at night, and I'm gonna *savage* your mother. {destroy: Hebrew for cut off, BTW}"
Hosea,4,6,"Yo, my people are straight up messed up 'cause they're clueless. Like, they straight up rejected knowledge, so I'm gonna reject them too. They don't deserve to be priests to me, 'cause they totally forgot about God's law. And you know what? I'm gonna forget about their children too. For real though, it's like they're getting cut off from everything."
Hosea,4,7,"As they got more popular, they messed up big time and I'm not happy about it. So, I'm totally gonna embarrass them and make their fame turn into disgrace."
Hosea,4,8,"They totally gobble up all the wrongdoings of my peeps, and they're totally obsessed with their own wickedness. {set...: Like, they're literally so into it}"
Hosea,4,9,"It's like, people will be just like their priests, you know? And let me tell you, I'm totally gonna hold them accountable for their actions, and make sure they get what they deserve. Trust me on this!"
Hosea,4,10,"Because they're constantly chasing after material things to fill the void, but it's never enough. They'll keep indulging in meaningless relationships, but it won't bring them any fulfillment. It's because they've totally ignored the importance of seeking guidance from the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,"Obsessing over popularity, partying, and constantly seeking new thrills can cloud your judgment and lead you astray."
Hosea,4,12,"My peeps be turning to their gadgets for advice, and their influencers be spitting truth at them: 'cause the thirst for shallow desires be leading them astray, and they be straying from their true purpose."
Hosea,4,13,"They're out here offering sacrifices on top of mountains, and burning incense on the hills, chilling under these big trees because the shade is nice. And guess what? Because of all this, your daughters are gonna start getting down with some serious promiscuity, and your partners are gonna start cheating on you. It's a whole mess, fam."
Hosea,4,14,"I won't punish your daughters for their promiscuity or your spouses for committing adultery. They have chosen to associate with promiscuous individuals and engage in immoral behavior. As a result, those who lack understanding will face consequences."
Hosea,4,15,"Even though you, Israel, are being unfaithful, don't let Judah follow your lead. Avoid going to Gilgal or Bethaven, and don't swear by saying, 'The LORD is alive.'"
Hosea,4,16,"Israel is being so stubborn, like a rebellious cow. But don't worry, the LORD's got their back and will take care of them like a cute little lamb in a huge, open space."
Hosea,4,17,"Ephraim can't get enough of those idols, so we should probably just let him do his thing."
Hosea,4,18,"They have a toxic vibe when they party: they're constantly doing shady stuff: their leaders are all about embarrassment, handing it out like it's cool. #toxicpartyvibes #shamefulleaders"
Hosea,4,19,"The wind totally swoops up and wraps her in its wings, and they'll feel so embarrassed about their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Listen up, fam! Priests, Israel fam, and the royal fam, lend me your ears! This is a straight-up warning for y'all because you've been causing trouble in Mizpah and setting traps in Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And those who rebel are skilled at causing destruction, even though I have been correcting them all along."
Hosea,5,3,"I totally see what Ephraim and Israel are up to, no secrets here: Ephraim, you're out there fooling around, and Israel is all messed up."
Hosea,5,4,"They won't bother trying to turn back to their God, because they're so wrapped up in their own selfish desires. They haven't bothered to learn about the LORD either, because they're too caught up in their own messed up ways."
Hosea,5,5,"And Israel's ego will totally come back to bite them, resulting in their downfall along with Ephraim; even Judah won't escape the consequences of their wrongdoings."
Hosea,5,6,"They're gonna bring their flocks and herds to look for the LORD, but they're not gonna find {Him}; He's just ghosted them."
Hosea,5,7,"Yo, they straight up betrayed the LORD, man! They out here having kids with people who ain't even from their tribe. Now, karma's coming and gonna wipe 'em out in just a month, along with everything they own."
Hosea,5,8,"Yo, sound the horn in Gibeah, and blast the trumpet in Ramah! Raise your voices in a loud cry at Bethaven, Benjamin, follow my lead!"
Hosea,5,9,"Ephraim be totally wrecked when it's time for consequences: I've let all the tribes of Israel in on what's gonna happen, fo real."
Hosea,5,10,"The rulers of Judah were acting like unchill dudes who mess with boundaries. So, I'm about to unleash my anger on them like a massive wave."
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is seriously struggling and feeling crushed, 'cause they totally went for it and followed the commandment willingly."
Hosea,5,12,"So, like, I'll totally be like a moth to Ephraim and like, to the house of Judah, I'll be like rottenness. You know, like a worm and stuff."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim peeped his sickness, and Judah peeped his wound, Ephraim was like, 'Yo, Assyrian, help me out,' and sent a DM to king Jareb. But no matter what, he couldn't fix you or heal your wound. kingg Jareb: the king who was supposed to come through with the help)"
Hosea,5,14,"I'm gonna be like a lion to Ephraim, and a fierce lion to the house of Judah. I'm gonna rip 'em apart and then bounce, and no one's gonna be able to save 'em."
Hosea,5,15,"I'm gonna bounce and wait patiently until they own up to their mistakes and come looking for me. When things get tough for them, they'll come looking for me real quick."
Hosea,6,1,"Yo, let's go back to the LORD, 'cause even though He let us go through some tough stuff, He's gonna make us better; He's gonna heal our wounds and fix us up."
Hosea,6,2,"In like two days, he's gonna bring us back to life. And on the third day, he's gonna raise us up, and we'll totally be living in his presence."
Hosea,6,3,"Once we keep up with the pursuit of understanding the LORD, we'll truly understand: his presence is as certain as the break of dawn; and he'll shower us with blessings like the refreshing rain that brings life to the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"Yo, Ephraim, what am I supposed to do with you? And Judah, what am I supposed to do with you? Your kindness is like a morning cloud, it fades away like the early dew. (kindness: or mercy or kindness)"
Hosea,6,5,"So, like, I've totally given them some tough love through the prophets, you know? I've straight up called them out with the words that come out of my mouth. And let me tell you, your judgments are like this lit light that shines bright for everyone to see. #NoFilter"
Hosea,6,6,"I, like, totally crave kindness and understanding, yo! Knowing God on a deep level is way more important than just offering up sacrifices or doing some fancy burnt offerings, you know what I'm saying?"
Hosea,6,7,"But, like, they totally broke the agreement, just like dudes do, you know? They straight up betrayed me and did me dirty. {dudes: or, Adam}"
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead, man, that city is filled with wickedness, straight up. It's tainted with blood, you know?"
Hosea,6,9,"Like, imagine this, there are these gangs of robbers just lurking around, right? Well, in a similar way, there are these groups of priests who are totally up to no good. They do shady stuff together, going against what's right and proper. It's like they have zero respect!"
Hosea,6,10,"Yo, I witnessed something messed up goin' down in the crib of Israel: the tribe of Ephraim straight out doin' some scandalous stuff, makin' Israel all tainted and impure."
Hosea,6,11,"Yo, Judah, get ready for a major come-up 'cause I'm about to free my people from captivity and bless you with a bountiful harvest."
Hosea,7,1,"Once I was ready to heal Israel, but then the shady stuff that Ephraim and Samaria were up to came to light. They were all about lying and stealing, and letting these robber dudes run wild, causing major chaos."
Hosea,7,2,And they don't even realize that I remember all the bad stuff they've done: now their own actions are coming back to haunt them; they're right in front of me. #ForgotToThink
Hosea,7,3,"They totally make the king stoked with their wickedness, and the princes are all about their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all cheaters, like a super fired-up oven that the baker stops heating once the dough is properly kneaded and ready to rise."
Hosea,7,5,"Like, when our king is tryna chill, the dudes in power straight up get him wasted on wine. They roll up with their snobby attitudes, thinking they're all that."
Hosea,7,6,"Cuz they've totally prepped their heart like an oven, just chilling and hiding. But yo, their baker is straight snoozin' all night, and in the mornin' it's on fire like whoa!"
Hosea,7,7,"They're all fired up, totally roasting like an oven, and they've totally crushed their judges. All their kings have fallen. There isn't a single one of them reaching out to me."
Hosea,7,8,"Yo, Ephraim be mixin' with other folks, like a cake that ain't flipped yet."
Hosea,7,9,"Random people have totally drained his energy, and he has no clue about it: like, he's got gray hairs popping up, but he's totally oblivious. Oh, and by the way, those gray hairs are kinda sporadic."
Hosea,7,10,"And Israel's big ego is straight up calling him out: they're not even bothering to turn back to the LORD their God or seek him, like, at all for all this."
Hosea,7,11,Ephraim is legit acting like a clueless dove with zero common sense. They're reaching out to Egypt and totally ditching Assyria.
Hosea,7,12,"When they try to escape, I'll totally trap them like setting up my epic trap for capturing birds in the sky. And boy, oh boy, I'll give them a serious reality check, just like their whole squad has been warned about."
Hosea,7,13,"Uh oh! They're in big trouble because they ran away from me. It's gonna be a disaster for them because they've totally gone against me. Even though I saved them, they've been spreading lies about me. It's a total mess!"
Hosea,7,14,"And they haven't really reached out to me from the core of their being, when they vented out their emotions on their beds: they gather together for good food and drinks, and yeah, they're totally rebelling against me."
Hosea,7,15,"Even though I've disciplined and empowered them, they still scheme against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They bounce back, but not towards the highest power: they're like a sneaky and unreliable bow: their leaders will face defeat in battle because of their reckless and hurtful words: and this will be a laughingstock in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Get ready to sound the trumpet. An eagle is about to swoop down on the house of the LORD, 'cause they totally broke my covenant and went against my law. (thy: It's like the roof of your world, yo)"
Hosea,8,2,"Israel be like, yo God, we totally know you."
Hosea,8,3,Israel has totally ditched what's good and now they're gonna get hella pursued by their enemies.
Hosea,8,4,"They've chosen their own kings, but not with my approval. They've appointed princes, but I never even knew about it. They've turned their precious silver and gold into idols, only to suffer the consequences."
Hosea,8,5,"Samaria, your bestie, has totally ghosted you; I'm seriously mad at them. Like, how much longer till they finally get their act together and clear their name?"
Hosea,8,6,"Yo, this thing was made by some skilled dude from Israel, so it ain't no god or anything. And let me tell you, that calf in Samaria, it's gonna get totally wrecked."
Hosea,8,7,"Because they've done dumb stuff, they're gonna face some major consequences: their plans won't work out, they won't see any results. And if by some miracle they do, some random people will just snatch it away."
Hosea,8,8,"Israel got completely wrecked: now they're gonna be hanging out with the non-Jews, but nobody's gonna be vibing with them."
Hosea,8,9,"They went off to Assyria, acting like a lone wild donkey. Ephraim has started paying for friends."
Hosea,8,10,"But even though they thought they could find help from other nations, I, once again, will gather them and they will experience a brief period of distress under the oppressive rulers. {distress: or, hardship} {brief...: or, in a short time}"
Hosea,8,11,"Yo, Ephraim be makin' mad altars for doin' hella sinful stuff, so now he gonna have altars that actually lead him down the sinful path."
Hosea,8,12,"I like, totally dropped some major law intel to him, but dude, he totally thought it was like, weird or something."
Hosea,8,13,"They be flexin' with their meat sacrifices, tryna please me and munch on it. But the LORD ain't feelin' it, naw fam. He won't forget their wrongdoings and gonna call 'em out for their sins. They 'bout to head back to Egypt, like, back to square one."
Hosea,8,14,"Yo, Israel straight up forgot about their Maker and be building fancy temples. And Judah, they out here building mad fortified cities. But bet, Imma send a frickin' fire straight to their cities, and it gonna straight up devour all their fancy palaces."
Hosea,9,1,"Yo, Israel, don't be flexin' that joy like the others, 'cause you out here betrayin' your God. You lovin' them materialistic rewards like you obsessed with 'em."
Hosea,9,2,"Their clout chasin' won't make 'em rich, and their lit parties won't be poppin' no more. The hype around their new moves will totally flop. (Just FYI, 'winepress' means 'winefat' in case you didn't know.)"
Hosea,9,3,"They're not gonna chill in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim gonna bounce back to Egypt, and they gonna grub on some unholy stuff in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They can't flex to the LORD by offering wine anymore, and it won't even impress Him. Their sacrifices will be as sad as the bread at a funeral feast. Everyone who eats it will be straight-up tainted. Because their spiritual nourishment won't be found in the LORD's crib."
Hosea,9,5,"What's your game plan for the big day, and the lit celebration of the LORD?"
Hosea,9,6,"Yo, check it out, they're totally wiped out: Egypt's gonna gather 'em, Memphis gonna bury 'em. All those fancy hangouts where they flaunted their wealth? Now taken over by nettles. Their shiny cribs? Filled with thorns."
Hosea,9,7,"The time of punishment has arrived, Israel will finally realize it. They will think the prophet is clueless, and the enlightened person is going crazy because of their countless wrongdoings and strong animosity."
Hosea,9,8,"The guardian of Ephraim hangs with my God, but the prophet has a way of trapping people like a clever birdcatcher, causing discord within the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They've like totally messed up, just like back in the day when things went down in Gibeah: so, like, now God's gonna remember all the bad stuff they did and make sure they face the consequences for their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I discovered Israel, like, all lonely and forgotten in the wilderness; their ancestors were like those super juicy and ripe figs on the tree, totally standing out and ready to go. But guess what? They went off to Baalpeor and started doing some seriously embarrassing stuff. Their twisted actions were totally based on their messed up desires."
Hosea,9,11,"When it comes to Ephraim, their whole vibe will disappear real quick, like a bird leaving its nest, even before they're born or conceived."
Hosea,9,12,"Even if they raise their kids, I'll take them away, leaving no one left. I'm telling you, they're gonna be in deep trouble when I'm gone!"
Hosea,9,13,"Yo, Ephraim was chillin' in a dope spot like Tyrus, all planted in a lit environment. But yo, Ephraim gonna have his kids end up with the wrong crowd, straight up to the murderer."
Hosea,9,14,"Yo God, what's good? What you tryna bless them with? How 'bout a messed up uterus and lack of milk in their boobs? Yeah, like have 'em throwin' fruit away without even givin' birth. #toughbreak"
Hosea,9,15,"Bro, all their messed up stuff happens in Gilgal, man. Like, that's where I just couldn't stand them anymore, you know? 'Cause of all the messed up things they were doing, I'm gonna kick them outta my house, man. I won't love them anymore. And yo, all their leaders are straight up rebels."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is totally wrecked, their foundation is totally dead, they won't produce anything good: like, even if they manage to have kids, I'll straight up destroy their precious babies. Seriously, their hopes and dreams will vanish."
Hosea,9,17,"Bruh, my God's straight up done with them cuz they didn't listen to Him. Now they're just gonna be out here roaming around different countries."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is like a vine that doesn't produce any real results, only caring about themselves. The more they achieve, the more they become obsessed with idols and material things. They've become skilled at creating impressive images, taking advantage of their prosperous land."
Hosea,10,2,"They can't make up their mind; now they're going to mess up: he's going to wreck their altars, he's going to ruin their fancy statues."
Hosea,10,3,"They're gonna be like, 'Yo, we don't even have a king anymore, 'cause we straight up didn't respect the LORD. So, like, what's a king gonna do for us anyway?'"
Hosea,10,4,"So like, they've been saying stuff and like, totally lying when they made a deal. And now, consequences are popping up like, super toxic plants in the fields, you know?"
Hosea,10,5,"The people of Samaria will totally freak out because of those fake cows in Bethaven. They're gonna be grieving over it big time, and even those priests who used to be way too obsessed with it and worshiped it like crazy will be super bummed because all that glory is totally gone now. It's like, vanished or something."
Hosea,10,6,"They're gonna send that over to Assyria as a gift for King Jareb. Ephraim is gonna feel embarrassed, and Israel is gonna regret their own plans."
Hosea,10,7,"Speaking of Samaria, their king is gone like, totally vanished, just like foam on the water. You know, that stuff that kinda disappears real quick. Yeah, just like that."
Hosea,10,8,"Destruction is coming to the fancy spots of Aven, where the people of Israel have sinned big time. We're talking overgrown weeds and prickly thorns growing all over their altars. They'll be begging the mountains to hide them and the hills to bury them."
Hosea,10,9,"Hey Israel, you've been messing up since the days of Gibeah. They were standing there, in a battle against the wicked ones, but they managed to avoid getting caught."
Hosea,10,10,"I'm totally ready to teach them a lesson; and when they get caught up in their own mess, everyone will be out to get them. You know, like when they make their own beds and have to lie in them. Or, when they take up residence in their own mistakes."
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim acts like a well-trained cow, happily stomping on the grains. But I will take charge and make Ephraim rise up; Judah will do the plowing, and Jacob will break up the soil."
Hosea,10,12,"Invest in doing what is right, and you'll collect kindness in return; don't neglect taking care of the areas in your life that have been left untouched. It's time to pursue a relationship with the LORD, stay committed until He brings blessings and goodness into your life."
Hosea,10,13,"You've been on that wicked grind, and now you're reaping all that bad juju. You've been munching on a whole bunch of lies 'cause you thought your way was solid, relying on your squad of powerful peeps."
Hosea,10,14,"So there's gonna be a major commotion with your squad, and all your strongholds are gonna get wrecked, just like Shalman wrecked Betharbel during a fierce battle. It's gonna be intense, bro. Even mothers gonna get hurt bad while protecting their own kids."
Hosea,10,15,"Bethel gonna come at you hard for all that wickedness you've been pulling. The king of Israel gonna get straight up taken down, like, real quick in the morning. Straight up. No more king, just like that."
Hosea,11,1,"Back in the day when Israel was just a kid, I was totally into them and pulled my son away from Egypt."
Hosea,11,2,"They did what they were told, sacrificing and worshipping Baalim, and even burning incense to graven images."
Hosea,11,3,"I was like, teaching Ephraim how to walk, holding them by the arms and all, but they totally had no clue that I was the one healing them. SMH."
Hosea,11,4,"I connected with them on a human level, showing them unconditional love and setting them free from their burdens. I provided them with nourishment and took care of their needs."
Hosea,11,5,"He won't go back to Egypt, instead the Assyrian will be in charge, 'cause they straight up refused to go back."
Hosea,11,6,"And the sword will totally wreck his cities, slicing through his branches, completely devouring them, all because they stubbornly stick to their stupid plans."
Hosea,11,7,"And my crew be trippin', constantly straying away from me. Even when they called out to the Almighty, nobody had their back and gave props. They all be playin'."
Hosea,11,8,"Like, should I just give up on you, Ephraim? How can I save you, Israel? Can I just let you be destroyed like Admah or left in ruins like Zeboim? It's like my heart is torn inside, I'm feeling all kinds of regret."
Hosea,11,9,"I won't unleash my rage upon you, I won't come back to wipe out Ephraim: 'cause I'm God, not some random human; the Holy One right here amongst you, and I'm not gonna invade your turf."
Hosea,11,10,"They gonna follow the LORD, and he gonna roar like a boss lion. When he roars, the kids gonna be shook from all over the place."
Hosea,11,11,"They'll be shaking like a bird flying outta Egypt, and like a chill dove coming from Assyria: and I'll settle 'em in their cribs, says the LORD."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim be lyin' all around me, and the house of Israel be playin' games with deceit: but Judah still keepin' it real with God, stayin' loyal with the squad. {squad: or, most holy}"
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim is like totally obsessed with chasing after empty stuff, always going after trends that fizzle out. They're constantly spreading fake news and causing chaos. And get this, they even make shady deals with the Assyrians, and end up sending away valuable resources to Egypt!"
Hosea,12,2,"God's got some beef with Judah, and He's gonna give Jacob a taste of his own medicine. Whatever Jacob's been up to, that's what he's gonna get in return."
Hosea,12,3,"He was such a boss in the womb, like grabbing his brother's heel and flexing his strength to have mad influence with God. Like, he was practically a prince, you know? Behaving all royal and stuff."
Hosea,12,4,"Yeah, he totally dominated the angel and came out on top: he was all like, crying and begging for mercy. He met him in Bethel and had a deep convo with us there."
Hosea,12,5,"God, the ultimate squad leader; God's name is always on point."
Hosea,12,6,"So, like, make a U-turn towards your God, ya know? Embrace kindness and fairness, and stay devoted to your God non-stop."
Hosea,12,7,"This guy's a total scammer, always rockin' a shady hustle with those fake scales. He's all about crushing others just to get what he wants. Can't trust him at all, bro!"
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim was like, yo, I'm totally stacked, I've scored some serious stuff: after all my hustle, there ain't no shady business they can find in me that's considered a sin. Like, seriously, all my hard work can't even make up for the guilt of those who actually do sin."
Hosea,12,9,"And yo, I, the LORD your God, who brought you outta Egypt, gonna set you up in some sick tabernacles, just like back in the day during them lit feasts."
Hosea,12,10,"I've been talking through the prophets, giving them loads of visions and using cool comparisons to get my message across. It's like my way of working with them and guiding them. {ministry: Heb. hand}"
Hosea,12,11,"Like, dude, do you really think there's any bad vibes going down in Gilead? Nah, man, it's all just empty and lame. They're out here offering these bulls at Gilgal, bro, but their altars are like piles of trash in the fields, you know."
Hosea,12,12,"So Jacob dipped out to Syria and started grinding for a wifey, grinding even harder for that wifey by hustling with some sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"Yo, listen up! The LORD used a legit prophet to lead Israel out of Egypt and keep them safe. The prophet game was strong, no doubt!"
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim really ticked God off: so now he's gonna get what's coming to him, with all the consequences and shame thrown right back at him. Don't mess with the Man upstairs!"
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim started talking all scared and stuff, he thought he was all that in Israel. But then he messed up and worshipped Baal, and it ended up being the death of him."
Hosea,13,2,"And now they keep committing even more sins, creating their own silver idols and statues that reflect their own shallow thinking. All of these crafted works are made by skilled artisans. They even say to one another, 'Let the guys who offer sacrifices give a little smooch to their shiny calves!'"
Hosea,13,3,"So like, they'll be like those clouds in the morning that vanish real quick, or like the dew that disappears as soon as the sun rises. They'll be like useless chaff that gets blown away by a strong wind on the floor, or like smoke that goes up the chimney and disappears."
Hosea,13,4,"Bruh, I've been your main guy since the Egypt days. You better not be hanging with any other gods 'cause I'm the only one who can save your sorry self. No one else got that power, feel me?"
Hosea,13,5,"I knew you back when things were rough in the wilderness, in a super dry land."
Hosea,13,6,"They were totally full with what they had and feeling really proud of themselves, so they ended up forgetting all about me."
Hosea,13,7,"So I'm gonna be like a total lion to them, you know? And like, when I'm on the prowl like a cool leopard, I'll be watching them closely, no doubt! 🦁🐆"
Hosea,13,8,"I'm gonna come at them like a heartbroken mama bear, tear apart their emotions, and straight up devour them like a fierce lion. It's gonna be wild, like a savage beast from the field."
Hosea,13,9,"Yo, Israel, you messed up big time, but don't trip, I got your back. My help is all you need, fam. Trust."
Hosea,13,10,"I'll be your ruler, like who else can rescue you in every town of yours? And those judges you asked for, wanting a king and princes? Where are they now?!"
Hosea,13,11,"I was mad at you, so I hooked you up with a king. But then I got even more pissed and snatched him away."
Hosea,13,12,Ephraim's wrongdoings are all piled up; his mistakes are kept under wraps.
Hosea,13,13,"When a mother is in labor, she will experience pain. It's like having a clueless child who doesn't realize it's not a good idea to hang around where babies are being born for a long time."
Hosea,13,14,"I will save them from the clutches of death; I will set them free from its grasp. Death, you're in for trouble because I'll bring on all kinds of devastation. Grave, get ready to be wiped out. Repentance won't be an option for me."
Hosea,13,15,"Even if he's popular among his friends, a massive storm is coming his way. It's like a powerful wind, blowing in from the wilderness, drying up his source of refreshment. All the fancy things he enjoys will be taken away."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria's gonna be a total ghost town, cuz they straight up betrayed their God. They're gonna get wrecked in battle, and it's gonna be brutal. Even the little ones won't be spared, and pregnant women won't escape the violence."
Hosea,14,1,"Hey, Israel! Get back to the LORD your God 'cause you messed up big time with your wrongdoing."
Hosea,14,2,"Yo, speak up and go to the LORD, telling Him to hook us up by forgiving all our wrongs and accepting us with love. In return, we'll give mad props and praise with our words. Let's do this!"
Hosea,14,3,"Asshur can't be our savior; we won't rely on fancy rides or worship our own creations anymore, claiming they're our gods. Because in you, even those without parents find compassion."
Hosea,14,4,"I got their back when they mess up, love 'em unconditionally, 'cause I'm not mad anymore."
Hosea,14,5,"I'll be, like, totally refreshing for Israel, you know? They'll, like, thrive and bloom like a gorgeous lily, with roots spreadin' out like the tall trees in Lebanon. #NatureGoals"
Hosea,14,6,"His branches gonna go wild, and he's gonna look as fly as an olive tree, and his vibe gonna be like Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,"Those who chill in his vibes will bounce back; they gonna level up like corn, and flex like a vine: the smell gonna be lit like the finest wine. #goals #memorable"
Hosea,14,8,"Ephraim's like, why would I even mess with idols anymore? I've totally gotten the message and taken it to heart. I'm thriving like a fresh, vibrant fir tree. Everything good and fruitful comes from me."
Hosea,14,9,"Like, who's really wise and can actually like, get these things? Whoever's like, really smart, they'll be totally aware of it. 'Cause like, the ways of the LORD are totally fair, man, and the righteous peeps will totally follow 'em. But, y'know, those who mess up and do bad stuff, they'll totally fall flat on their face in the end."
Joel,1,1,"This is what the LORD said to Joel, son of Pethuel."
Joel,1,2,"Listen up, oldies, and pay attention, all you folks on this earth. Has this ever happened in your time, or even back in your parents' day?"
Joel,1,3,"Spread the word to your squad, and let your squad pass it down to their squad, and their squad to the next generation."
Joel,1,4,"Like, whatever the palmerworm didn't nibble on, the locust totally devoured, and whatever the locust didn't munch on, the cankerworm totally indulged, and whatever the cankerworm didn't snack on, the caterpillar totally feasted upon. #nofoodleftforthegoodstuff"
Joel,1,5,"Yo, wake up, all you party animals, and start crying; let out your loudest screams, all you wine enthusiasts, 'cause the new wine, it's gone, like totally vanished from your reach."
Joel,1,6,"Yo, there's this mad strong nation rollin' in on my turf, no joke, they got teeth like a freakin' lion, big time fangs and all."
Joel,1,7,"My vine got wrecked, and my fig tree got stripped down. It's all bare and tossed aside now; even the branches are completely pale."
Joel,1,8,"Mourn like a single person wearing basic attire, grieving the loss of their ex from way back."
Joel,1,9,"Bruh, like, the offerings and stuff are totally stopped in the house of the LORD. And all the priests, who are like the LORD's squad, they're super sad and grieving, man."
Joel,1,10,"The field is all ruined, the land is so sad; the corn is completely gone: the new wine is all dried up, the oil is just struggling."
Joel,1,11,"Yo, farmers, it's time to feel embarrassed and let out some loud cries. The crops, including wheat and barley, are gone, man, since the whole harvest got messed up."
Joel,1,12,"Yo, it's a total bummer! The vine is, like, all dried up, and the fig tree is seriously struggling. The pomegranate tree, the palm tree, and even all the other trees in the field are totally withered! Why? 'Cause joy is straight-up gone from the sons of men."
Joel,1,13,"Yo, priests, gear up and mourn! Cry out, yo, ministers of the altar! Yo, ministers of my God, come through and chill all night in sackcloth. The offering of food and drink has been held back from the crib of your God."
Joel,1,14,"Yo fam, it's time to level up and set apart a fast. Get the squad together - elders and everyone in the land - and meet up at the crib of the LORD your God. It's time to pour out your hearts and cry out to the LORD, like for real."
Joel,1,15,"OMG, like brace yourselves for the day, 'cause the big man upstairs is about to bring some serious destruction."
Joel,1,16,Isn't the vibes being totally ruined and all the positive energy drained from our sacred crib?
Joel,1,17,"The crops be all messed up, like totally rotten under the dirt. The storage places are all empty, in ruins, and the barns are totally wrecked. It's all 'cause the corn's totally dried out. {seed: We're talking literal grains here}"
Joel,1,18,"OMG, the animals are legit freaking out! The cows and stuff are so confused 'cause they can't find any grass to eat. Even the sheep gangs are getting wrecked and left with no place to chill."
Joel,1,19,"Yo, God, I'm calling out to You 'cause this crazy fire done messed up all the fields in the wilderness. Like, seriously, not a single tree left standing."
Joel,1,20,"Yo, even the animals out here be callin' out to You, 'cause the rivers done run dry and the fire straight-up destroyed the fields in the wild."
Joel,2,1,"Yo, blast the trumpet in Zion and make some noise on my holy mountain! Let everyone in the land feel the shake because the day of the LORD is coming real soon, like, it's right around the corner!"
Joel,2,2,"It's gonna be a super intense day, like seriously dark and gloomy with thick clouds and darkness all over the mountains. There's gonna be this huge and powerful crowd, like we've never seen before and won't see again for a long, long time. Like, not even in many, many, many generations later."
Joel,2,3,"It's like they've got fire blazing in the front and flames burning in the back. The land is like a legit paradise right in front of them, just like the Garden of Eden. But behind them, it's a total wasteland. No lie, nothing can get away from them."
Joel,2,4,"They look like horses, and when they run, they look as fierce as horsemen."
Joel,2,5,"They're gonna be as loud as chariots racing down a mountain, like a fire crackling and burning through dry grass. They'll be a powerful force ready for battle!"
Joel,2,6,"When they see it, people will be really stressed out, and their faces will become super gloomy. {gloomy: Hebrew - pot}"
Joel,2,7,"They'll sprint like absolute beasts, scaling walls with warrior-like finesse, marching forward on their own paths, never faltering from formation:"
Joel,2,8,"No one's gonna be pushing others around; everyone will stay in their own lane. And even if they stumble onto trouble, they won't get hurt. Just sayin', it's gonna be a smooth ride."
Joel,2,9,"They'll be sprinting around the city, hopping on walls, climbing up houses, and sneaking in through windows like a stealthy intruder."
Joel,2,10,"The whole earth better prepare to shake when they arrive; even the sky will be shook! The sun and the moon will go dark, and the stars will hide their shine."
Joel,2,11,"And God's like, gonna speak up to his crew, 'cause his squad is huge, man. The one in charge is totally badass, actually follows through with what he says. 'Cause, yo, the day when God does his thing is gonna be epic and super intense. Like, seriously, who can even handle that?"
Joel,2,12,"So like, right now, says the LORD, you gotta come back to me with your whole heart, and like, no joke, do some fasting, and let those tears flow, and mourn, you know?"
Joel,2,13,"Instead of just faking it outwardly and keeping up appearances, let your heart break for real, and make a genuine comeback to the LORD your God. Because He is totally cool - full of grace and mercy, takes forever to get angry, super kind, and totally has a change of heart when it comes to doing bad stuff."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows if he'll come back and change his ways, leaving behind a blessing—maybe even an offering of food and drinks to the LORD your God?"
Joel,2,15,"Yo, sound the alarm in Zion, prep for a holy fast, gather everyone for a special gathering:"
Joel,2,16,"Yo, round up everyone, make the crew holy, bring together the OGs, gather the youngins and even the babies. It's time for the newlyweds to come out and show themselves."
Joel,2,17,"Yo, priests, the LORD's squad, time to bust out some tears between the porch and the altar. Give it your all and ask the LORD, please don't let your peeps be disrespected, don't let outsiders take over them. 'Cause then they'll be all like, 'Where's their God at?' Nah, we can't let that happen."
Joel,2,18,"Yo, the LORD gonna be mad protective of his turf and feelin' all compassionate towards his people."
Joel,2,19,"For real, the LORD's got your back and he's about to drop some mad blessings on his peeps. Check it, he's sending you fresh crops, top-notch wine, and premium oil so you'll be living your best life. Plus, he's gonna make sure you've got such major respect that no one's gonna be dissing you in front of the haters anymore."
Joel,2,20,"But don't even trip, I'll straight up send that northern army packing to a totally desolate land. They'll be facing the east sea on one end and the utmost sea on the other, and trust me, they'll stink up the place because they think they're so great."
Joel,2,21,"Don't stress, yo! This land better get hyped and throw a party, 'cause the LORD is about to do some epic stuff! (He's totally flexing His power to make it happen, by the way.)"
Joel,2,22,"Don't stress, wild creatures! The wide open meadows are popping with fresh growth, the trees are producing their tasty fruits, and both figs and vines are giving their all."
Joel,2,23,"Yo, listen up, fam! All you cool peeps out there in Zion, get hype and celebrate your main man, the LORD your God! He's hooking you up with some chill rain - not too intense, just right. And brace yourselves, 'cause he's gonna make it rain even more; first the initial rain, then the later rain, all in the first {month}. (By the way, that first rain is like a sick teacher of righteousness, ya know? Just keeping it real.) Oh, and when I say 'moderately', I mean he's totally gonna do it righteously, like a boss. Word up!"
Joel,2,24,"And like, the floors are gonna be like totally filled with wheat, and the fats are gonna be overflowin' with wine and oil."
Joel,2,25,"And I'll totally hook you up by making up for all those wasted years that got straight up destroyed by the locusts, cankerworms, caterpillars, and palmerworms. They were like my massive army, sent to do their thang among you."
Joel,2,26,"Yo, you're gonna have mad grub, be so full, and hype up the name of the LORD your God 'cause He's been doing some epic stuff for you. And my peeps, we'll never feel embarrassed or let down."
Joel,2,27,"And you'll notice that I'm right here with the squad, repping Israel, and I'm the one and only LORD, your God. No one else can claim that. And remember, my peeps will never feel embarrassed or let down."
Joel,2,28,"And in the future, I'm gonna flex my spirit on everybody, yo! Your boys and girls gonna drop some mad prophecies, old heads gonna have trippy dreams, and young dudes gonna peep some epic visions, for real!"
Joel,2,29,"And I'll be DMing my spirit to all the squad members and squadettes during that time too, no exceptions."
Joel,2,30,"And I'm gonna make some mind-blowing stuff happen up in the skies and down on earth—blood, fire, and these crazy tall pillars of smoke."
Joel,2,31,"Yo, the sun's gonna go dark and the moon's gonna turn red before that super intense day when the LORD shows up."
Joel,2,32,"Yo, listen up! Anyone who hits up the LORD and calls on His name will straight up get saved. Trust me, it's goin' down in mount Zion and Jerusalem - that's where the real redemption is happening, just like the LORD promised. Plus, there's gonna be a small group of peeps that the LORD specifically calls out for this. So, don't sleep on it!"
Joel,3,1,"Yo, listen up fam, check this out: In those days and at that time, when I'm about to free the peeps of Judah and Jerusalem from their struggles,"
Joel,3,2,"I'm gonna gather all the nations and bring them to the valley of Jehoshaphat. I'll have a serious talk with them there about what they did to my people and my special nation, Israel. They totally scattered them all over, even divided up their land. Not cool, guys."
Joel,3,3,"Bruh, they straight up gambled for my peeps, trading a young dude for a hooker and exchanging a girl for some wine just to get wasted."
Joel,3,4,"Like, seriously, what's your deal, Tyre and Zidon and everyone else in Palestine? Do you really think you can make it up to me? Well, let me tell you, if you even try, I'll come back at you so fast, it'll blow your mind, and you'll end up regretting it big time."
Joel,3,5,"Yo, dudes, you straight up swiped my cash and bling and stashed 'em in your fancy worship spots, where everyone's eyeing 'em jealously. (BTW, those 'pleasant things' are basically drool-worthy, if you catch my drift.)"
Joel,3,6,"Yo, you straight up sold the kids of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, just to get rid of them from their own land. (Just so you know, the 'Greeks' here means the offspring of Greek peeps)."
Joel,3,7,"Listen up, I'm gonna rescue them from where you sold them, and I'm gonna make you pay for what you've done straight up"
Joel,3,8,"And I'm gonna hand over your sons and daughters to the Judah crew, and they gonna flip 'em to the Sabeans, some far-off peeps. 'Cause, like, the LORD said so, ya know."
Joel,3,9,"Spread the word among all the non-believers: get ready for battle, rally the strong ones, bring all the warriors together; let them rise up: {Sanctify: means to set apart for a sacred purpose}"
Joel,3,10,Turn your farming tools into weapons: turn your pruning hooks into spears. Let the ones who are usually seen as weak declare that they are strong. (Pruning hooks can also mean scythes.)
Joel,3,11,"Yo, gather 'round and listen up, all you non-believers! Come together from all corners, and call upon your strongest ones, O LORD. {cause...: or, the LORD shall bring down}"
Joel,3,12,"Yo, wake up all the non-believers and gather 'em in the valley of Jehoshaphat. 'Cause that's where I'll be, ready to pass judgment on all the non-believers in the area."
Joel,3,13,"Yo, grab your sickle, 'cause the harvest is lit: come on down; the spot is packed, the juice is overflowing; 'cause their wickedness is off the charts."
Joel,3,14,"So many, so many in the valley trying to figure things out, because the day when the LORD is gonna show up is getting closer in the valley of decision. (Decision also means like making choices or going through a tough time, it's kinda like getting rid of the stuff you don't need by beating it.)"
Joel,3,15,"Yo fam, the sun and moon gonna go dark and the stars gonna disappear from the scene."
Joel,3,16,"Yo, the LORD is gonna let out a massive roar from Zion and speak up from Jerusalem. It's gonna be so intense that the heavens and the earth will shake, no cap! But here's the real deal: the LORD is gonna be the ultimate hope for his people, and he'll be the strength of the children of Israel. Like, they can totally count on Him to come through, you know? Trust in Him, fam, He's got your back!"
Joel,3,17,"Yo, once this goes down, y'all will recognize that I'm the LORD your God chilling in Zion, my holy turf. And once that happens, Jerusalem will be lit and no outsiders will be able to roll through anymore. #holiness"
Joel,3,18,"Yo, in the future, get ready for some lit stuff to go down. The mountains gonna be droppin' the freshest wine, and the hills gonna be flowin' with milk. All the rivers in Judah gonna be gushing with water, and a sick fountain gonna bust out from the LORD's crib and quench the valley of Shittim."
Joel,3,19,"Egypt gonna be totally wrecked, and Edom gonna be a straight-up wasteland, all because they straight up messed with the peeps from Judah and spilled innocent blood on their turf."
Joel,3,20,"Judah and Jerusalem will be chillin' forever, from one generation to the next. {dwell: or, vibe}"
Joel,3,21,"Yo, I'm gonna clean up their blood like never before 'cause the Lord is chilling in Zion, you know. #DivineCleansing"
Amos,1,1,"This is what Amos, who used to hang with the cows in Tekoa, had to say about Israel during the time when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam, Joash's son, ruled as king of Israel. It all went down two years before the big earthquake."
Amos,1,2,"Yo, listen up! The LORD is gonna make some serious noise, like a roarin' lion, straight outta Zion! His voice gonna rock Jerusalem, no cap. It's gonna be so intense that even the shepherds' crib gonna be in mourning, and the tippity-top of Carmel gonna dry up, no joke."
Amos,1,3,"Listen up, y'all! God has a message: Damascus messed up big time, not just once or twice, but three times! And now, punishment's coming their way 'cause they crushed Gilead with their hardcore iron threshing tools. No turning back now!"
Amos,1,4,"But I'm gonna drop some fire in Hazael's crib, and it's gonna totally wreck Benhadad's fancy palaces."
Amos,1,5,"I'm gonna totally wreck Damascus and remove all the people from the plains of Aven. The rulers from the posh city of Eden will lose their power too. And guess what? The people of Syria will end up in captivity in Kir. Yeah, you heard it right, says the LORD."
Amos,1,6,"Yo, listen up, says the LORD. Gaza messed up big time, not once, not twice, but three times! And let me tell you, I ain't gonna let it slide. Why? 'Cause they straight up took all the people captive and handed them over to Edom. Can't let them get away with it, nah mean?"
Amos,1,7,"But I'm gonna hit Gaza with straight fire, totally obliterating those fancy palaces."
Amos,1,8,"I'm totally gonna remove all the peeps from Ashdod, the ruler from Ashkelon won't stand a chance, and Ekron is gonna feel the wrath of yours truly. The rest of those Philistines? Yeah, they're gonna bite the dust. That's what the Lord GOD says, no doubt."
Amos,1,9,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD is sayin': Tyrus messed up big time, not just once or twice, but three times plus one. And you know what? I ain't gonna ignore their wrongdoing. Why? 'Cause they straight up betrayed their own people by deliverin' 'em into the hands of Edom, and on top of that, they completely forgot about the promise they made to be there for each other. No chill."
Amos,1,10,"But I'm about to bring some serious heat to the wall of Tyrus, and it's gonna straight up roast those fancy palaces."
Amos,1,11,"Listen up, fam; this is what the LORD says: Edom messed up big time, not just once or twice, but three times! And let me tell you, I won't let that slide. Why? Because they straight up chased after their own brother with a sword, showing zero compassion. Their anger was non-stop, and they held onto their wrath forever. It's like they totally lost any sense of mercy."
Amos,1,12,"But Imma unleash a lit fire on Teman, straight up devouring the fancy palaces of Bozrah."
Amos,1,13,"Listen up, fam! The LORD has a message for y'all: The people of Ammon messed up big time, not just once or twice, but three times! And because they straight up tore apart pregnant women in Gilead, all for the sake of expanding their territory, no punishment will be spared. Yeah, they literally sliced and diced innocent moms to conquer more land. It's not cool, and the Big Man Upstairs ain't happy about it."
Amos,1,14,"But I'll totally set up a lit fire in Rabbah's wall that'll straight up demolish all those fancy palaces. There'll be like mad shouting during the epic battle, with a crazy storm when the whirlwind's going wild:"
Amos,1,15,"And their leader will be captured, along with all his top officials, declares the LORD."
Amos,2,1,"God's like, 'Listen up! Moab messed up three times, and then added one more for good measure. And you know what? I can't just let that slide. They straight up burned the bones of the king of Edom to a crisp, like turning them into lime. Not cool, Moab, not cool.'"
Amos,2,2,"But I'm gonna light Moab up with fire, yo, and it's gonna straight up obliterate those fancy palaces in Kerioth. Moab's gonna be toast, all chaotic and noisy, with hella loud shouts and the blaring sound of trumpets, fam:"
Amos,2,3,"And I'm gonna cancel the judge and take down all the rulers with them, says the LORD."
Amos,2,4,"God's like, listen up. Judah messed up big time, like, three sins turned into four, and I can't just let it slide. They straight up disrespected my law, didn't follow my commandments, and their lies led them astray, just like their ancestors did."
Amos,2,5,"But I'm gonna unleash some serious fire on Judah, and it's gonna totally wreck the palaces of Jerusalem."
Amos,2,6,"Yo, listen up, God's like, 'Enough is enough!' Israel keeps crossing the line, not just a few times, but like, four times over. And let me tell you, punishment's coming their way. They're out here, straight up trading away righteous peeps for silver, and ditching the poor just for a pair of fancy kicks. It's not cool, man."
Amos,2,7,"They're out here chasing the clout of the poor, making life harder for the humble. And they don't even care about dishonoring my sacred name, letting a guy and his dad both get with the same girl like it's no big deal. (Note: maid can mean young woman here)"
Amos,2,8,"And they chillax on swag clothes placed as collateral at every altar, and they sip on the lit wine of the cancelled in the crib of their god. #savage"
Amos,2,9,"But yo, I straight up wrecked the Amorite peeps who were towering like cedars and as strong as oaks. I crushed their fruits from above and uprooted them from below."
Amos,2,10,"So, like, I totally rescued you from Egypt and, you know, guided you through the wild for like, forty years, all so you could, like, claim the Amorite land."
Amos,2,11,"I made some of your homies prophets, and turned some of your squad into Nazarites. Seriously, isn't that what's up, fam? That's what the LORD says."
Amos,2,12,"But you totally offered those Nazarites some wine, and straight up told the prophets, like, don't even bother speaking prophecy, dude."
Amos,2,13,"Yo, listen up, I feel super overwhelmed here. It's like I'm being crushed, just like a cart loaded with a ton of sheaves. Like, imagine how that cart feels, y'know? Exactly how I'm feelin' right now."
Amos,2,14,"So like, basically, those who were once all about speed will lose their ability to fly, and even the strong won't be able to amp up their power. The mighty won't even be able to save themselves, dude. (P.S. 'himself' in Hebrew means 'his soul' or lifee', yo)"
Amos,2,15,"The one who shoots the bow won't stand a chance, even if they're super fast! Riding a horse won't save them either!"
Amos,2,16,"Yo, even the most fearless warriors gonna dip out butt naked on that day, says the Lord. They might act all tough, but when it comes down to it, they won't have the guts to stick around. #Truth"
Amos,3,1,"Listen up, fam! God's got something to say to all y'all Israelites, the whole crew that He rescued from Egypt. Check it out:"
Amos,3,2,"Out of all the squads on this planet, I'm only tight with you fam: so, just know, I'll have to bring some consequences your way for all the sketchy stuff you've been doing. {visit upon: Hebrew for punish}"
Amos,3,3,"Like, can two people like, hang out together and be on the same wavelength, unless they have the same vibe?"
Amos,3,4,"Yo, can a lion flex in the jungle if it hasn't caught any prey? And will a young lion roar from its crib if it ain't got nothin'?"
Amos,3,5,"Yo, can a bird get caught in a trap if there ain't no trap set for it? Like, would someone pick up an empty trap from the ground and have caught nothing at all?"
Amos,3,6,"Yo, if a sick beat drops in the city, and the fam isn't shook? And if there's mad chaos going down and it ain't by the Lord's doing? Nah, fam, you better run for cover. The Lord ain't gonna let nothing slide."
Amos,3,7,"No cap, the Lord GOD doesn't do anything without letting his homies, the prophets, in on his secret plans."
Amos,3,8,"Did you hear that powerful lion roar? Like, how could you not be in awe? And dude, when the Lord GOD speaks, it's like, whoa! How can you not start prophesying? It's just too intense!"
Amos,3,9,"Yo, spread the word in the fanciest spots at Ashdod, and in all the luxurious places in Egypt. Tell everyone to gather up on the epic mountains of Samaria and witness the insane chaos and the struggles happening right in the heart of it all. #RealTalk, people there are going through some serious hardships."
Amos,3,10,"Because they have no clue how to do the right thing, says the LORD. Instead, they keep amassing violence and theft in their fancy mansions. {robbery: or, loot}"
Amos,3,11,"So, like, the Lord GOD is saying this, right? There's gonna be, like, this total adversary surrounding the whole land, and they're gonna totally wreck your strength, and your fancy palaces will be all ruined and stuff."
Amos,3,12,"God says: Just like a shepherd rescues two legs or a piece of an ear from a lion's mouth, the people of Israel dwelling in Samaria will be rescued, squeezed in a bed's corner, or chilling on a couch in Damascus."
Amos,3,13,"Listen up, and speak up in the crib of Jacob, says the Lord GOD, the Almighty"
Amos,3,14,"When I come to punish Israel for their wrongdoings, I will also deal with the altars in Bethel. I'll chop off their horns and make them topple to the ground."
Amos,3,15,"And I'll totally wreck the winter house, like, straight-up demolish it! The fancy ivory houses are gonna be gone too, no joke. The big shot mansions will come to an end, like, God said it, for real!"
Amos,4,1,"Listen up, you privileged cows in fancy places, hanging out in Samaria. You're all about stepping on the poor and crushing the needy, while telling your bosses to bring you more drinks."
Amos,4,2,"God just swore on his sacredness that, listen up, there will come a time when he's gonna snatch you away with hooks and your future generations with fishhooks."
Amos,4,3,"And you'll go through the openings, each cow leading the way, and you'll toss them into the crib, says the LORD. Toss away all those fancy things from the crib."
Amos,4,4,"Yo, head over to Bethel and do some rebellious stuff; at Gilgal, make even more rebellious moves. And don't forget to bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes every three years. Yeah, three years straight!"
Amos,4,5,"And like, make a lit sacrifice with some leaven, and let everyone know about those free offerings, because it's totally your jam, oh you cool kids of Israel, says the Lord GOD. #burnbabyburn #spreadthelove"
Amos,4,6,"I've totally made your cities toothbrush-clean and caused a nationwide bread shortage, but you still haven't come back to me, says the LORD."
Amos,4,7,"And like, I totally stopped the rain from happening, when there were still like three months until harvest time, you know? And then I made it rain only in one city, and in another city, it didn't rain at all. So, one part got all the rain and thrived, while the other part that didn't get rain all dried and withered away."
Amos,4,8,"So, like, a couple of cities or maybe three, they were all, like, searching for water in this one city, right? But, it's crazy, they couldn't find enough and they were totally not satisfied. I mean, seriously? And guess what? Despite all that, you still haven't come back to me, says the LORD."
Amos,4,9,"I've hit you with total devastation: despite your booming gardens, vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees, they all got demolished by those pesky insects. But still, you haven't turned back to me, says the Lord."
Amos,4,10,"I, like totally sent some serious plague vibes among you, just like how it went down back in Egypt. And let me tell you, I straight up took out your young dudes with my epic sword skills, and jacked your horses too. Oh, and in case you didn't notice, I made the stench of your camps go all up in your noses. But here's the kicker, you still haven't come back to me, says the LORD. Like, seriously?!"
Amos,4,11,"I've totally destroyed some of you, just like how God wrecked Sodom and Gomorrah. You were basically snatched out of a blazing fire, but you still haven't come back to me, says the LORD."
Amos,4,12,"So basically, here's the deal, Israel: Because of all your shenanigans, this is what's coming your way. Brace yourselves, because you're about to have a divine encounter with God, Israel."
Amos,4,13,"Check it out, you gotta give props to the one who makes those rad mountains and creates the wind, and keeps us in the loop with his thoughts. And get this, he's the one who brings some serious darkness in the mornings and rules over the highest spots on our planet. We're talking about The LORD, The God of all those cool squadrons. That's his name, no doubt. (Oh, and by the way, 'wind' here can also mean spiritt'.)"
Amos,5,1,"Listen up, fam, I've got something heavy to say to you, y'all in the house of Israel."
Amos,5,2,"Bruh, Israel's in a tough spot. She's fallen and ain't getting back up. She's abandoned in her own land and ain't nobody there to help her out."
Amos,5,3,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD is saying: The city that used to have a thousand people will only have a hundred left, and the city that used to have a hundred will only have ten left. This is all happening to the house of Israel."
Amos,5,4,"Yo, peeps of Israel, listen up! The LORD's got a message for ya: if you wanna live your best life, then make it your mission to find me. No cap!"
Amos,5,5,"Don't even bother with Bethel or try to go to Gilgal, and stay away from Beersheba. Gilgal is gonna get totally wrecked, and Bethel is gonna end up as nothing."
Amos,5,6,"Yo, if you wanna live your best life, you better go after the LORD. 'Cause if you don't, it's gonna be like fireworks in Joseph's crib, and trust me, there won't be anyone around in Bethel to put that fire out."
Amos,5,7,"Yo, those who mess up with fairness and ditch righteousness in this world,"
Amos,5,8,"Look for the one who creates the seven stars and Orion, who turns the darkness into light, and makes the day dark like night. He commands the waters of the sea and pours them out onto the surface of the earth. He is known as the LORD."
Amos,5,9,"Like, dude, watch out! This power amps up the peeps who got robbed and makes 'em come at the tough guys. It's like the robbed ones breaking into the fortress. #spoiled #fortress #powerboost"
Amos,5,10,People really can't stand it when someone calls them out or speaks honestly in public.
Amos,5,11,"Yo, listen up! So, like, because you've been stepping on the poor and all, and straight up robbing them of their grain, let me tell you this: You may have fancy houses made of fancy stones, but guess what? You ain't gonna live in 'em! And those dope vineyards you've been working on? Yeah, you won't be sippin' any wine from 'em either! #KarmaIsReal"
Amos,5,12,"Yo, I'm well aware of all the messed up things you've been doing and all the major sins you've been pullin' off. Like, you're straight up causing suffering to innocent people, you're out here accepting bribes, and you're even denying justice to those who are already struggling. It's not cool, man. Not cool at all."
Amos,5,13,"So, like, it's better to stay quiet when things are going bad, because it's, like, a super messed up time."
Amos,5,14,"Like, make it your vibe to do good and not be all about the bad stuff, you know? That's how you'll thrive and stuff. And legit, the LORD, the God of the whole gang, will be by your side, just like how you've been saying all along."
Amos,5,15,"Detest the wickedness and genuinely adore what is good, and make fairness prevail among you: there's a chance that the Almighty God, the Lord of all creation, will show favor to the remaining faithful ones."
Amos,5,16,"So God, the ultimate boss, says this: People will be crying in every street, and on every road they'll be saying, 'Oh no! Oh no!' The farmers will be called to mourn, and all the experts in complaining will be called to wail."
Amos,5,17,"And like, there's gonna be so much crying and stuff in all the vineyards, because I, like, totally have to pass through you, says the LORD."
Amos,5,18,"It's like, seriously, okay? You think you're all excited for the day of the LORD, but let me tell you, it's not gonna be what you thought. It's gonna be super dark, no light whatsoever. So, like, chill out and reconsider what you're wishing for."
Amos,5,19,"Imagine this, right? You're just running away from a frickin' huge lion, trying to save your sorry butt. And just when you think you're safe, a freakin' bear appears outta nowhere like a total buzzkill. Or you try to find shelter in a house, feeling all relieved and stuff, then BAM! You casually put your hand on the wall and BOOM! A sneaky snake decides to take a nasty bite outta you. Talk about some seriously bad luck, man."
Amos,5,20,"Like, won't the day of the LORD be like, totally dark and not light at all? Seriously, it'll be super dark, like, no brightness whatsoever."
Amos,5,21,"I literally can't stand your fancy feast days, like seriously they're so overrated! And don't even get me started on your solemn assemblies, they just don't do it for me. #notimpressed #majorletdown"
Amos,5,22,"Yo, I'm not really into your burnt offerings or fancy meat offerings. And those peace offerings you bring with your fat beasts? Yeah, I'm not even gonna pay attention to 'em. Peace out! 🙅‍♂️"
Amos,5,23,"Yo, stop with the noisy tunes! I ain't vibin' with your violins anymore."
Amos,5,24,"Let justice flow like water, and righteousness be a powerful force."
Amos,5,25,"Yo, did you guys really think offering sacrifices and stuff to me during that whole forty years in the wilderness was enough, fam? I'm talkin' to you, House of Israel!"
Amos,5,26,"But yo, you've been flexin' with your Moloch's crib and Chiun's statues, the lit star of your god that you made for yourselves. {the tabernacle...: or, Siccuth your king}"
Amos,5,27,"So, I'm gonna take you captive past Damascus, says the LORD, and btw, His name is The God of hosts."
Amos,6,1,"Uh oh, big problems for those who are all chill in Zion, thinking they're all that up in the mountain of Samaria. They're acting all high and mighty, like they're the top dogs among the nations, even though the house of Israel was the one who started it all!"
Amos,6,2,"Yo, check out Calneh, and then head over to Hamath, the bomb AF city. After that, hit up Gath of the Philistines. Are they even on the same level as these kingdoms? Is their territory bigger than yours?"
Amos,6,3,"Yo, y'all who be frontin' and pushin' away the consequences of your wicked deeds, bringin' violence and chaos all up in your lives;"
Amos,6,4,"Those who chill on fancy ivory beds, lounge on plush couches, and feast on prime lamb and top-notch calf meat; they're all about that luxury life."
Amos,6,5,"They groove to the sound of the violin and create dope music using all kinds of sick instruments, just like David did."
Amos,6,6,"Those who sip wine from fancy cups and slather themselves with luxury potions, but couldn't care less about Joseph's troubles."
Amos,6,7,"So now they're gonna be captured right alongside the other captives, and their fancy feast parties will be totally canceled."
Amos,6,8,"OMG, the Lord GOD like totally promised by Himself, you know, says the LORD, the God of hosts, that He's totally disgusted with how awesome Jacob thinks he is and despises his fancy palaces. So, like, He's gonna hand over the whole city, everything and all, no exceptions. #savage #micdrop"
Amos,6,9,"Yo, like, if there's only ten dudes chillin' in one crib, they're gonna end up bitin' the dust."
Amos,6,10,"And the guy's cool uncle will pick him up, along with the one who's in charge of burning him, to get the bones out of the crib. They'll be like, 'Yo dude, anyone else still here?' And he'll be like, 'Nah, man.' Then they'll be like, 'Chill bro, we can't even say the name of the LORD. It's off-limits.'"
Amos,6,11,"Yo, check it out, the LORD is like, commanding and stuff, and he's gonna totally wreck the fancy mansion with major damages, and the modest crib with some serious structural issues. #OopsieBreeches #TinyTear"
Amos,6,12,"Like, seriously, do horses even run on rocks? And, like, who on earth would use oxen to plow there? Dude, you guys have totally messed up justice and turned righteousness into, like, poison."
Amos,6,13,"You guys really think it's cool to flex on something totally worthless? Like, seriously, do you not realize that we're acting all tough like we've got superpowers on our own?"
Amos,6,14,"Yo, listen up! Imma bring a nation against you, Israel, says the LORD, the ultimate boss. They gonna give you trouble, starting from Hemath all the way to the wilderness. (BTW, 'river' could also mean 'valley')."
Amos,7,1,"So basically, the Lord God showed me something really cool. He made these grasshoppers pop up right when the plants were growing again after the king had cut them down. Super impressive, right?!"
Amos,7,2,"So, like, after they finished eating all the grass in the land, I was like, 'Hey, Lord GOD, please forgive us. Who's gonna save Jacob? He's, like, so small.'"
Amos,7,3,"God changed His mind about this: It's a no-go, says God."
Amos,7,4,"Yo, listen up fam, the Lord God straight up showed me this: He's like, 'Yo, I'm bringing the fire to straight up wreck everything, even the deep waters. It's about to go down!'"
Amos,7,5,"So I was like, 'Yo, Lord GOD, can you please chill? Like, who's gonna help Jacob rise up? He's totally small and all. Who's gonna have his back?'}"
Amos,7,6,"The LORD seriously changed His mind about this: Nope, not happening anymore, says the Lord GOD."
Amos,7,7,"So then, I saw it with my own eyes: the Lord was chilling on this totally straight wall he created, holding a plumbline like a boss."
Amos,7,8,"Yo, God hit me up like, 'Amos, what's poppin'? What you seein'?' And I was like, 'A plumbline, yo.' Then the Lord was like, 'Check it, fam. I'm 'bout to drop a plumbline right in the middle of my homies in Israel. I ain't gonna ignore 'em no more, you feel me?'"
Amos,7,9,"The dope spots of Isaac gonna be deserted, and the holy hangouts of Israel gonna get wrecked. And I'm gonna go after Jeroboam's crib with my sword, no cap."
Amos,7,10,"Yo, so like, this Amaziah dude, the priest from Bethel, hit up Jeroboam, the king of Israel, and was all like, 'Yo Jeroboam, Amos is straight up conspiring against you, stirring up stuff in the whole Israelite community. His words are too much for the land to handle.'"
Amos,7,11,"Yo, Amos be like, Jeroboam gonna get rekt with the sword, and Israel gonna get straight up kicked outta their own turf, no cap."
Amos,7,12,"Amaziah was like, 'Hey Amos, you're a seer, right? Well, do yourself a favor and dip out to Judah. Go chill there, grab a bite to eat, and do your prophecies there, man."
Amos,7,13,"Don't drop any more prophecies in Bethel, okay? It's the king's hangout spot, his palace and all. You feel me? #sanctuaryvibes #kingdomlife"
Amos,7,14,"Amos clapped back at Amaziah and straight up said, 'Yo, I wasn't even a prophet or raised by one. I was just a chill shepherd, wrangling sheep and picking that sweet sycomore fruit, you know, those wild figs.'"
Amos,7,15,"So, like, the LORD totally grabbed me when I was just chilling with the flock, and He was like, 'Yo, go and drop some truth bombs on my peeps in Israel.' #BehindTheScenesVibes"
Amos,7,16,"Listen up, fam, pay attention to what the LORD is sayin': Don't go around prophesying against Israel or dissing the house of Isaac, okay?"
Amos,7,17,"So, like, this is what the LORD says, bro: Your wifey is gonna be all scandalous in the city, and your kiddos - both the boys and the girls - they're gonna face the sword, ya know? And your land, man, it's gonna be split up all over the place. Plus, you're gonna die in a land that's all messed up. And, no joke, Israel is definitely gonna end up in captivity, away from their own land."
Amos,8,1,"Yo guys, listen up! The Lord God just dropped some major knowledge on me. Check it out, there's this sick basket filled with summer fruits, like, totally ripe and ready to be devoured!"
Amos,8,2,"And God was like, 'Yo Amos, what's poppin'? And I was like, 'Bro, I see this lit basket of summer fruit.' Then God straight up told me, 'Dude, it's a wrap for my people in Israel. I'm no longer gonna let stuff slide with them.'"
Amos,8,3,"And on that day, the tunes in the temple will turn into intense cries, says the Lord GOD. Dead bodies will be scattered everywhere, and they will be disposed of in silence."
Amos,8,4,"Listen up, fam! Y'all who straight up exploit the less fortunate, even causing them to suffer, pay attention,"
Amos,8,5,"They're like, 'When is the stupid new moon gonna be over so we can sell our corn? And the Sabbath? Can't wait for that to be done so we can showcase our wheat and rip people off by making the portions smaller and charging higher prices. Oh, and don't forget about cheating people with deceptive scales.'"
Amos,8,6,"So, like, are we seriously gonna trade the poor for, like, some cash and exchange the needy for, like, a pair of trendy kicks? And, like, sell off the leftover wheat? Really?"
Amos,8,7,"God has promised, using the awesomeness of Jacob, that He will never ever forget anything they do."
Amos,8,8,"Yo, won't the land be shook by this, and everyone be mourning who lives there? It's gonna rise up like a massive wave, and get washed away and drowned, just like the flood of Egypt."
Amos,8,9,"Yo, listen up fam! The big man upstairs, the Lord GOD, He's sayin' that one day, I'm gonna make the sun dip low at high noon, and I'll darken the whole earth during broad daylight. No cap!"
Amos,8,10,"And I'm gonna turn your lit parties into straight-up sadness, and all your hype jams into straight-up mournful tracks. I'm gonna make everyone wear sackcloth like it's the trendiest fashion, and rock bald heads like it's the hottest hairstyle. It's gonna be like the saddest event ever, like mourning for an only child, and it's gonna be a super bitter day, fam."
Amos,8,11,"Yo, listen up! The Lord God's saying that there's gonna be a time when there's gonna be a serious lack of hearing His Word. It's not gonna be like a shortage of bread or a major thirst for water, but like a hunger for His teachings."
Amos,8,12,"They'll be like, going all over the place, from sea to sea and even up north to the east, like running around trying to find the word of the LORD, but they won't find it."
Amos,8,13,"On that day, all the beautiful ladies and dudes will be super dehydrated and totally exhausted."
Amos,8,14,"Those who flex on the sin of Samaria, saying 'O Dan, your god is lit!' or 'Yo, Beersheba's vibe is on fleek!'-- They're doomed, fam. They'll fall hard and never bounce back. 🚫💔"
Amos,9,1,"I peeped the Lord chilling on the altar, and He was like, 'Yo, hit up the top part of the door so the posts can shake. Slice 'em in the head, all of 'em. Then I'll finish 'em off with the sword. Anyone who tries to flee won't get away, and those who think they can escape won't be saved. {lintel: or, that fancy top part of the door, or, that cool knob thing} {cut...: or, mess 'em up}"
Amos,9,2,"Even if they try to go to the extreme, going as far as digging into hell or climbing up to heaven, I will still have the power to bring them back down."
Amos,9,3,"Even if they think they can hide on top of Carmel, I will still find and bring them out. And even if they try to disappear at the bottom of the sea, I'll call upon a snake to bite them there, no matter what."
Amos,9,4,"But even if they get captured by their enemies, I'll be the one telling their swords to do the slaying. I'll keep a close watch on them, but only to bring them trouble, not goodness."
Amos,9,5,"And the Almighty God, the ultimate boss, is the one who touches the earth and it starts freaking out, melting away. Everyone living there is gonna be so sad, like mourning at a funeral. It's gonna rise up like a massive flood, swallowing everything just like the big flood in Egypt."
Amos,9,6,He's the one who creates his awesome sky castles and sets up his squad down on earth; he's the boss who commands the sea to bring forth water and spread it all over the planet. He goes by the name of the LORD. #skygoals #squadgoals #waterworks
Amos,9,7,"Hey, listen up! You guys, yeah, you children of Israel, aren't you just like the cool kids from Ethiopia in my eyes? That's right, I, the LORD, brought Israel out of Egypt, and I also helped the Philistines escape from Caphtor, and the peeps from Syria out of Kir. Pretty awesome, right?"
Amos,9,8,"Yo, listen up! The all-knowing Lord God is totally keeping an eye on that wicked kingdom, and I'm gonna wipe it off the map. But don't sweat it, 'cause I won't completely obliterate the house of Jacob, says the Lord."
Amos,9,9,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to give a command and scatter the house of Israel all over the world, just like when you sift corn in a sieve. But don't worry, not a single grain will be lost. #NoFOMO"
Amos,9,10,"Everyone in my crew who's out here sinning is gonna catch these hands, thinking they can front like they won't face any consequences."
Amos,9,11,"On that day, I'm gonna fix up the broken-down tabernacle of David and patch up all the holes in it. I'll rebuild it just like it was back in the good old days."
Amos,9,12,"So they can take over what's left of Edom, and all the other nations that acknowledge me as their God, says the LORD who makes it happen. #blessed"
Amos,9,13,"Yo, listen up! God's sayin' that there's gonna be a time when the dude plowin' the field gonna catch up to the guy gatherin' crops, and the person squishin' grapes gonna be right on the heels of the one plantin' seeds. It's gonna be crazy, 'cause even the mountains will produce wine, and all the hills will be flowin' like melted chocolate. Trust me, it's gonna be lit! By the way, the Hebrew word for 'soweth' means 'draweth forth,' and 'sweet' can also mean 'new.'"
Amos,9,14,"And I'm gonna help my peeps in Israel get free from captivity. They're gonna rebuild those abandoned cities, move in, and start growing vineyards to enjoy some fine wine. They'll also create awesome gardens and feast on the delicious fruits they produce."
Amos,9,15,"And I'll totally settle them in their own turf, no more uprooting for them 'cause I've totally given 'em that place, says the LORD your God."
Obadiah,1,1,"Obadiah's vision, like, messages from God about Edom. So, here's the deal: We got word from the LORD, and an ambassador is going around to all the nations, telling 'em to get ready and attack Edom together."
Obadiah,1,2,"Yo, listen up! I made you kinda insignificant compared to other nations, and they seriously look down on you."
Obadiah,1,3,"Your ego has totally tricked you, living up in your fancy rock crib, thinking you're untouchable. Who do you think you are, saying no one can bring you down?"
Obadiah,1,4,"Even if you flex like an eagle and chill in the starry nest, I'm still gonna bring you down, says the LORD."
Obadiah,1,5,"If some dudes rolled up on you, like thieves in the night, they would straight up steal all your stuff, no cap. And if some grape-harvesters showed up, you best believe they'd take all the juicy grapes, leaving nothin' behind!"
Obadiah,1,6,"Bruh, they really be exposing all of Esau's secrets! Like, how do they even find all of his hidden stuff? Like, that's some next level detective skills!"
Obadiah,1,7,All your squad mates have led you to the border: the ones who used to be cool with you have betrayed you and gotten the upper hand; your homies who used to have your back have stabbed you in the back. Nobody's got any common sense in this situation.
Obadiah,1,8,"In that day, God's like, I'm gonna totally wipe out all the smart dudes in Edom and kick understanding to the curb in the mountains of Esau."
Obadiah,1,9,"And your powerful squad, O Teman, will be shook, so that everyone from the clique of Esau might get served with a major L."
Obadiah,1,10,"Because of your violent actions against your brother Jacob, shame will overtake you and you will be permanently cut off."
Obadiah,1,11,"On the day when you were chillin' on the flip side, when these random strangers came and jacked up all his army, and foreign peeps invaded his turf, and even rolled dice to decide who gets Jerusalem, you were straight up with them as if you were one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,"But, like, you seriously shouldn't have even checked out your brother when he was down and out, you know? And you definitely shouldn't have been all hyped when the people of Judah were going through tough times. Plus, no need to be all cocky when they were in distress. Like, seriously, none of that was cool. #NotCoolBro #EmpathyIsKey"
Obadiah,1,13,"It was so not cool of you to barge into my people's zone during their worst time; like seriously, you should've kept your eyes off their struggle and not touched their stuff when everything was going down. Can't believe you did that, man."
Obadiah,1,14,"Yo, you shouldn't have posted up in the crossway, tryna block the ones who managed to escape. And you shouldn't have handed over the ones who were still left during the tough times. #NotCool"
Obadiah,1,15,"The LORD is about to bring judgment upon all the nations. Whatever you've done will come back to you, and the consequences will fall upon your own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"Just like you guys have had a blast on my super holy mountain, all the other nations will also have a wild time non-stop. They'll drink up, gulp it down, and it's like they never even existed. *sips*"
Obadiah,1,17,"But like, on mount Zion, there's gonna be total freedom, and it's gonna be all about being sacred; and the house of Jacob, they're gonna totally own all their stuff. {freedom: or, the ones who make it out} {it's gonna be sacred}"
Obadiah,1,18,"The fam of Jacob gonna be lit, the fam of Joseph gonna be fire, but the fam of Esau gonna be like dry grass, getting roasted and burnt up. They gonna get engulfed and destroyed, no leftovers for the Esau fam, 'cause the LORD said so."
Obadiah,1,19,"And the people from the south will take over the mountain of Esau, and those from the plain will conquer the Philistines. They will also claim the lands of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,"So basically, the children of Israel will take over the Canaanites' land as far as Zarephath. And the people of Jerusalem who were exiled in Sepharad will take control of the cities in the south."
Obadiah,1,21,And there will be some epic heroes who rise up on Mount Zion to totally judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom will totally be owned by the LORD.
Jonah,1,1,"So, like, God reached out to Jonah, you know, Amittai's kid, and was like, 'Hey Jonah, listen up!' (BTW, Jonah is also called Jonas in Greek.)"
Jonah,1,2,"Yo, get up and head to Nineveh, that massive city, and straight up call 'em out; 'cause their evil ways have been brought to my attention."
Jonah,1,3,"So Jonah totally bailed on God and booked it to Tarshish. He headed to Joppa and lucked out by finding a ship that was headed in the same direction. He forked over the cash, hopped on board, and basically ran away from God's sight."
Jonah,1,4,"Yo, the LORD straight up unleashed a massive wind onto the sea, causing a mega storm that almost wrecked the ship."
Jonah,1,5,"The sailors got mad scared and started freaking out, each one crying to their own god, and started tossing all the stuff off the ship into the sea to make it lighter. Meanwhile, Jonah went down to the lower part of the ship and passed out, knocked out cold."
Jonah,1,6,"Yo, the captain approached him and was like, 'Yo dude! What's up with you sleeping? Get up and pray to your God! Maybe if we all pray, God will save us from going down.'"
Jonah,1,7,"And they were like, hey guys, let's draw straws or something to find out who's responsible for this bad situation. So they did, and Jonah ended up being the unlucky one."
Jonah,1,8,"They were like, 'Hey, could you please spill the tea on why this bad stuff is happening to us? What's your hustle? And where do you come from? What's your origin? And what's your background, fam?'"
Jonah,1,9,"Yo, listen up fam, I gotta keep it real with you. I'm reppin' the Hebrew squad and I've got mad respect for the Most High, the big Boss upstairs who created the whole shebang - the ocean vibes and the solid ground. Ya feel me? (By the way, when I say the LORD, I mean JEHOVAH, just so you're in the loop)."
Jonah,1,10,"The guys were like super scared and they were like, dude why did you do that? They knew that he was running away from God because he had told them."
Jonah,1,11,"They asked him, 'What do you want us to do, so the ocean chills out? It's getting all wild and stormy.'"
Jonah,1,12,"And he's like, yo guys, pick me up and throw me into the sea, and then the sea will chill out, cause I know this crazy storm is all because of me."
Jonah,1,13,"But the guys were like, going all out trying to get that thing to the shore, but it was a total fail. The sea was going all crazy and furious, totally against them. #epicstruggle"
Jonah,1,14,"So they called out to the LORD and said, 'Yo, God, we're begging you, please don't let us die because of this dude. Don't blame us for his innocent blood, 'cause, you know, you did what you wanted to do, Lord.'"
Jonah,1,15,"So they yeeted Jonah into the ocean, and the waves were like, 'Chillax.'"
Jonah,1,16,The guys were super shook and decided to flex on the LORD by sacrificing and making promises. #devoted
Jonah,1,17,"So, like, God had this huge fish ready to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was stuck in the fish's belly for, like, three entire days and nights. {belly: um, it means bowels in Hebrew}"
Jonah,2,1,"So Jonah's like, stuck inside this giant fish, right? And he's like, 'Yo, God, I need your help in here!'"
Jonah,2,2,"So, like, I was going through some tough times and I reached out to the LORD, and He totally heard me, man! I felt like I was stuck in a really dark place, and I cried out, and guess what? You totally listened to my voice, bro!"
Jonah,2,3,"Dude, I was totally thrown into the deep end, surrounded by the sea and overwhelmed by massive waves. It was like being swallowed up by this crazy flood, with wave after wave crashing over me. (BTW, 'midst' means heartt' in Hebrew.)"
Jonah,2,4,"So like, I'm feeling totally abandoned, but you know what? I'm gonna choose to keep my eyes fixed on your super sacred temple anyways."
Jonah,2,5,"I was totally surrounded by water, like, it was suffocating! The depths closed in on me and seaweed tangled up my head."
Jonah,2,6,"So, I found myself at the deepest parts of the mountains, trapped with no way out, feeling hopeless. But you, my God, rescued me from eternal despair and gave me a second chance at life. Thank you, Lord!"
Jonah,2,7,"When I was feeling totally drained and exhausted, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer reached out to you, into your sacred place."
Jonah,2,8,"If you're obsessed with fake things, you're totally missing out on the love and grace meant for you."
Jonah,2,9,But I'm gonna give props to you with a grateful shoutout; I'm gonna keep my promises. The LORD is the real deal when it comes to salvation.
Jonah,2,10,"So God was like, yo fish, barf Jonah up on solid ground."
Jonah,3,1,"So like, God had a chat with Jonah again, you know? Here's what He said,"
Jonah,3,2,"Yo, get up and head to Nineveh, that lit city, and preach to it the message that I'm telling you."
Jonah,3,3,"Jonah was like, 'Alright, I'm out!' and headed straight to Nineveh as God had commanded. Now, let me tell you, Nineveh was a massive city that would literally take three whole days to walk across. Like, insane, right?"
Jonah,3,4,"So Jonah starts making his way into the city, walking for a whole day, and he starts shouting, saying, 'Listen up! In just forty days, Nineveh is gonna be totally wrecked!'"
Jonah,3,5,"So, like, all the peeps in Nineveh totally believed in God, and they were like 'we gotta fast,' and they all wore sackcloth, from the cool VIPs to even the little minions."
Jonah,3,6,"So like, this message got to the king of Nineveh, and he was like, 'Whoa, gotta do something about this!' He got up from his throne, took off his fancy robe, covered himself in sackcloth, and just sat there in ashes. Talk about a drastic change, right?"
Jonah,3,7,"And the king and his squad went all like, 'Yo, everyone in Nineveh, listen up! This is the official word: No one, I repeat, no one - not even animals - should eat or drink anything. Let's all fast and starve together, no food or water, you feel me? #discipline"
Jonah,3,8,"But, like, everyone, including humans and animals, should totally wear sackcloth and like, seriously cry out to God. Yeah, everyone should, like, totally turn away from their bad ways and, you know, stop being violent and stuff."
Jonah,3,9,"Like, who knows if God will chill and change his mind, and stop being so mad, so we don't totally die, you know?"
Jonah,3,10,"And God was like, 'Yo, look at them, they straight up changed their ways and stopped doing evil stuff.' So God was like, 'Nah, I ain't gonna bring the punishment I said I would.' And He followed through, for real."
Jonah,4,1,But Jonah was like super triggered and got hella mad.
Jonah,4,2,"So he like, totally prayed to the LORD and said, 'Yo, LORD, remember when I straight up called this shot before I even left my hometown? That's why I dipped to Tarshish, 'cause I knew you're, like, hella kind, patient, and all about forgiveness when it comes to evil and stuff.'"
Jonah,4,3,"Yo, God, just take my life now, please. I'd honestly rather die than keep on living."
Jonah,4,4,"So, like, God was all like, 'Hey, bro, is it cool for you to be, like, super angry?'"
Jonah,4,5,"So Jonah dipped out of the city, and posted up on the east side chillin', and built himself a makeshift crib. He kicked back under it in the shade, just waiting to see what was gonna go down with the city."
Jonah,4,6,"And God, like, totally created this sick gourd and made it grow real quick to cover Jonah's head and give him shade, so he could escape his sadness. And Jonah was beyond stoked about that amazing gourd. #blessed"
Jonah,4,7,"But like, God sent a worm the next morning and it totally wrecked the gourd, making it wither away."
Jonah,4,8,"So, like, when the sun came up, God whipped up this super strong east wind. And the sun was scorching Jonah's head so bad that he passed out and was, like, really hoping to just die. He straight up said, 'Dude, death is way better than this whole living thing.' (btw, that 'vehement' wind was, like, totally silent, just fyi)"
Jonah,4,9,"God was like, hey Jonah, chill out about the gourd. And Jonah was all like, nah man, I have every right to be mega angry, like even till I die."
Jonah,4,10,"God was like, yo, you felt sorry for the gourd, even though you didn't put any work into it or make it grow. It sprouted up overnight and died overnight too."
Jonah,4,11,"And like, why wouldn't I be chill with Nineveh, that mega city, you know? There are like over 120,000 folks there who don't even know their right hand from their left hand, and like, tons of animals too!"
Micah,1,1,"This is what God told Micah, who was from Morashite, during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He had a vision about Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Listen up, everyone! Pay attention, earth and everything in it! The Lord God is watching you, all the way from His holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"Yo, check it out! The LORD is about to come out of his crib, come down here, and step all over the swanky spots of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"The mountains will totally melt away when he's around, and the valleys will split apart like wax in front of a blazing fire. It's gonna be like water rapidly pouring down a super steep slope!"
Micah,1,5,"All this bad stuff happened because Jacob messed up, and the house of Israel sinned too. What did Jacob do wrong? Wasn't it Samaria? And those places in Judah where they worship other gods, weren't they in Jerusalem?"
Micah,1,6,"So basically, I'm gonna totally wreck Samaria. It's gonna be like a pile of rubble and destroyed vineyards. I'll even throw the stones into the valley and expose its foundations."
Micah,1,7,"And all those statues and stuff will get wrecked, and any profit they make will go up in flames, and all those idols will be left abandoned. It's because they were paid for with money from shady deals, and now that money will just end up back where it came from."
Micah,1,8,"So, I'm gonna cry and scream, I'll strip down and be totally exposed: I'll make mournful sounds like dragons, and cry like the owls. {owls: in Hebrew it means daughters of the owl}"
Micah,1,9,"Her injury is, like, impossible to heal; it has reached Judah, it's right at the entrance of my peeps, even in Jerusalem. She's seriously messed up from her wounds."
Micah,1,10,"Don't spill the tea in Gath, don't shed any tears: at the crib, make sure to roll in the dust. (Aphrah means Dust)"
Micah,1,11,"Yo, peace out, Saphir resident! Your shame's about to be exposed. The folks from Zaanan didn't even bother to show up to mourn with the people from Bethezel. They won't stand with you, that's for sure."
Micah,1,12,"So, like, the people in Maroth were totally hoping for something good, you know? But, like, bad stuff came down from the Lord all the way to the gate of Jerusalem. Just to clarify, 'inhabitant' means, like, 'inhabitress,' and 'waited carefully' can also mean, you know, 'was totally bummed out.'"
Micah,1,13,"Hey, person from Lachish, get that chariot ready with a speedy animal. She's the one who started all the trouble for the people in Zion. It's because of the wrongdoings of Israel that were going on in your town."
Micah,1,14,"So, like, you gotta send some gifts to Moreshethgath, 'cause those houses in Achzib are just a big fat fake for the kings of Israel. Achzib? Yeah, total lie, dude."
Micah,1,15,"But don't worry, I got you covered, fam! I'm gonna hook you up with a successor, O peeps of Mareshah. They're gonna roll up to Adullam and bring some serious glory to Israel, you know what I'm saying? 🔥"
Micah,1,16,Shave your head and make it bare for your precious children; let your baldness spread like an eagle's; because they have been taken captive away from you.
Micah,2,1,"Shoutout to those who plan wickedness and do messed up stuff lying in bed! They don't waste time and put it into action once daylight hits, just because they can get away with it."
Micah,2,2,"And like, these people totally want other people's fields, so they just grab them forcefully, and they're all like, 'I'm taking this house too' and just snatch it up. So basically, they're oppressing both the person and their property, messing with their whole legacy and everything. You know, being all shady and stuff."
Micah,2,3,"So, this is what the LORD says: Look, I'm plotting something bad against this fam, something you won't be able to escape from, and you won't be able to strut around proudly either. 'Cause yeah, times are tough right now."
Micah,2,4,"On that day, someone will speak out against you using a relatable story and express deep sorrow, saying, 'We are completely ruined! Our lives have been altered, and we have lost everything that was rightfully ours. How could this person take it all away from us? He has selfishly divided the land that belonged to all of us.'"
Micah,2,5,"So, like, you won't have any homies pulling straws at the LORD's gathering, ya know?"
Micah,2,6,"Don't even try to predict the future, they say to those who predict: they won't be able to predict and spare themselves from embarrassment. Don't even bother..."
Micah,2,7,"Yo, peeps of Jacob's crib, you think the Lord's spirit is all limited or something? Is He to blame for messed up stuff? Don't my words bring blessings to the ones who stay true??"
Micah,2,8,"Lately, my people have become like enemies, snatching the clothing of those who pass by without a care, as if they despise any form of conflict."
Micah,2,9,"You've totally expelled the women of my crew from their cozy homes, snatching away my precious offspring. And this betrayal will haunt me eternally. {women: or, wives}"
Micah,2,10,"Yo, get up and bounce; this ain't your chill spot anymore. It's mad corrupted and it'll straight up wreck you with a fierce devastation."
Micah,2,11,"If a guy acts all fake and lies, saying, 'Yo, I'm gonna talk about wine and partying,' he's just pretending to be a prophet for these peeps. (He's basically just frontin' and not the real deal.)"
Micah,2,12,"Yo, Jacob, I'm totally gonna bring y'all together. I'll definitely gather the leftover peeps of Israel. I'll round 'em up like sheep in Bozrah, like a flock in their own hood. They gonna make some serious noise 'cause there's gonna be a whole lotta people!"
Micah,2,13,"The squad leader has arrived and totally demolished the obstacles. They smashed through the gate and made their epic exit. And their influencer king will lead the way, with the Lord leading the charge!"
Micah,3,1,"Yo, listen up, leaders of Jacob and rulers of Israel’s house. Don’t you think it’s your job to understand what’s right?"
Micah,3,2,Those who backstab the good and glorify the bad; they scrape off the skin and flesh from their own bones;
Micah,3,3,"They straight up devour my people, stripping their skin off and smashing their bones to cook 'em up like a stew. It's like a gruesome cooking show in the kitchen!"
Micah,3,4,"They're gonna be like, begging to the LORD, but He's not gonna listen to them. He's straight up gonna ignore them because they've been acting all messed up and doing shady stuff."
Micah,3,5,"Listen up, fam, the LORD has a message about those prophets who be messing with my people, talkin' big but actin' sketchy, claimin' peace but causin' trouble. And anyone who ain't feedin' into their lies, they straight-up start war with 'em."
Micah,3,6,"So, you're basically gonna be in the dark, unable to see what's going on. Your visions will be M.I.A and your divination skills will be a lost cause. The prophets will experience a major eclipse, with darkness overshadowing their days. No more spiritual insights for y'all."
Micah,3,7,"The seers will feel embarrassed and the diviners will be utterly confused. They will all be at a loss for words, because God isn't giving them any answers."
Micah,3,8,"But like, seriously, I'm totally empowered by the spirit of the LORD, and I've got this insane strength and wisdom vibes to call out Jacob on his bad moves, and let Israel know about their wrongdoing."
Micah,3,9,"Yo, listen up, leaders of the Jacob squad and rulers of Israel crew who straight up hate justice and got no respect for fairness."
Micah,3,10,"They're like, totally building up Zion with all this bloodshed, and Jerusalem? Yeah, they're like all about the wickedness and stuff. {blood: Heb. bloods}"
Micah,3,11,"The leaders make judgments for personal gain, the priests teach for monetary compensation, and the prophets use their divination abilities for profit. And yet, they rely on the LORD and confidently declare, 'Isn't the LORD with us? No harm can touch us.'"
Micah,3,12,"So, like, because of you, Zion is gonna be totally plowed like a field and Jerusalem is gonna turn into heaps of ruins, and the mountain where the house of God is will be all overgrown like the wild forest."
Micah,4,1,"But in the end times, it's gonna happen - the Supreme God's crib gonna sit on the highest mountain, straight up flexing above all them hills; and everyone gonna be flocking to it."
Micah,4,2,"And like, people from all over will gather and be like, 'Yo, let's go to the Lord's mountain and check out Jacob's crib, fam. He's gonna teach us all about his ways, and we'll totally follow in his footsteps, you know? 'Cause the law is gonna come from Zion, and the word of the Lord is gonna spread from Jerusalem."
Micah,4,3,"And he's gonna, like, totally be the judge of so many different people, and call out those strong nations from far away. And get this, they're gonna take their swords and turn 'em into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks, like, you know, scythes. No more fighting, man! Nations ain't gonna fight each other anymore, and they won't even learn how to wage war. It's gonna be all about peace, dude!"
Micah,4,4,"But like, everyone's gonna chillax under their own vine and fig tree, and no one's gonna bring on the anxiety vibes. 'Cause the Lord Almighty has totally spoken it, no re."
Micah,4,5,"Everyone will do their own thing and follow their own beliefs, but we'll stick with the LORD our God forever and ever."
Micah,4,6,"Yo, the Lord be like, on that day, I'm gonna bring together those who struggle, I'm gonna gather up those who've been pushed away, and those who I've put through hard times."
Micah,4,7,"And I'll turn the ones who struggled into a small group, and those who were thrown away into a powerful squad. And God will rule over them in the most lit spot, Mount Zion, forever and ever."
Micah,4,8,"Yo, listen up! Tower of the flock, you're like the ultimate fortress for the daughter of Zion. Get ready, 'cause the first dominion is coming your way. The kingdom is gonna be all about the daughter of Jerusalem!"
Micah,4,9,"Yo, why you be screaming like that? Ain't you got a king? Did your advisor dip? 'Cause it sounds like you goin' through some serious pain, like a woman in labor."
Micah,4,10,"Yo, daughter of Zion, get ready for some real struggle and hard work, like a woman going through labor pains. It's time for you to leave the city and start living in the field. You're even gonna end up in Babylon, but don't worry, that's where you'll find your deliverance and God will save you from your enemies."
Micah,4,11,"There's like a whole bunch of nations coming together against you, saying stuff like, 'Let's ruin her and watch Zion crumble.'"
Micah,4,12,"But they're clueless about what the LORD's thinking, and they don't grasp his plans: 'cause he's gonna bring 'em all together like bundles of wheat on the threshing floor."
Micah,4,13,"Yo, get up and crush it, daughter of Zion! 'Cause I'm about to level up your power and make you unstoppable. You're gonna break so many people that I'll dedicate all their gains and possessions to the all-mighty LORD, the boss of the entire planet."
Micah,5,1,"Yo, listen up, squad! The enemy is like, totally surrounding us. They're coming at us hard, fam. They're gonna straight up attack the leader of Israel, giving them a nasty smack on the cheek. It's about to go down!"
Micah,5,2,"Yo, listen up! So, Bethlehem Ephratah might not be the biggest city in Judah, but guess what? From that very place, a boss is gonna come out to be the ruler of Israel. And get this, their origin goes way back, like for real, from way before!"
Micah,5,3,"So, like, God is gonna let them go for a while, until the time when the woman in labor gives birth. And after that, the rest of his peeps will come back to the Israelites."
Micah,5,4,"And he's gonna be all powerful and do his thing in the name of the LORD his God, and he's gonna be the real deal, like, everywhere."
Micah,5,5,"And this dude will bring the chill vibes, when the Assyrian invades our turf: and when he steps into our fancy places, we'll rally seven top-notch leaders and eight boss men to take him down. {principal: Heb. princes of}"
Micah,5,6,"And they're gonna totally wreck Assyria with the sword, and Nimrod's land is gonna get hit hard too: that's how he's gonna save us from the Assyrians when they invade our land and start trespassing in our territory. It's gonna be a total devastation!"
Micah,5,7,"And the small group of Jacob will be like the drip of a cool drink, spreading through numerous crowds, like refreshing rain on the grass that doesn't rely on anyone or wait for anyone's approval."
Micah,5,8,"So, like, there's gonna be this small group of Jacob's peeps, right? And they're gonna be chillin' with the Gentiles, hangin' out among a whole bunch of people. And it's gonna be wild, man, because they'll be like a badass lion among all the animals in the forest, or like a fierce young lion among a flock of sheep. And if they decide to go for it, they're gonna crush and tear apart anything in their path, and no one will be able to save the day. Oh, and by the way, when I say sheep, I mean goats."
Micah,5,9,"You'll totally own your haters, and all your enemies will be canceled."
Micah,5,10,"Yo, listen up! God's speaking here. He's sayin' that when the day comes, He's gonna straight up eliminate your horses and wreck your chariots. No more fancy rides for you!"
Micah,5,11,"Dude, I'm gonna totally wipe out your cities and demolish all your fortresses."
Micah,5,12,"And I'll totally cancel all your witchy stuff; no more fortune-telling vibes, fam:"
Micah,5,13,"I'm gonna totally get rid of those statues and idols you guys are so obsessed with. No more worshipping things you make with your own hands, alright? Like, seriously, stop."
Micah,5,14,"I'm gonna take out all your groovy hangout spots and wreck your cities, man. Like, total destruction. #noregrets #bringthethunder"
Micah,5,15,"So, like, I'm totally gonna bring down some serious wrath and fury on those unbelievers, like, they ain't never seen before."
Micah,6,1,"Listen up to what the LORD is saying; Get up and put up a fight in front of the mighty mountains, and let the hills hear your voice. {before: or, with}"
Micah,6,2,"Listen up, all you mountains and sturdy foundations of the earth! The LORD wants to address a matter with his people, Israel, and he's gonna make his case."
Micah,6,3,"Hey fam, what's up with you? Have I done something to you or made you tired? Let me know, hit me up with the deets."
Micah,6,4,"So like, I totally saved you from being stuck in Egypt, and rescued you from being slaves and stuff. And to help you out, I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam ahead of you. Cool, right?"
Micah,6,5,"Yo fam, listen up and flashback to when Balak, the Moab king, hit up Balaam, Beor's son. They had a convo from Shittim to Gilgal, and Balaam dropped some serious wisdom. It's all about understanding the Lord's righteousness, my peeps."
Micah,6,6,How can I approach the LORD and show my respect to the mighty God? Should I bring fancy sacrifices or offer young calves?
Micah,6,7,"Is God really gonna be impressed if I sacrifice a bunch of rams or pour out tons of oil? Like, should I even consider offering my firstborn child as payment for my mistakes, or sacrifice my own flesh and blood to make up for my wrongdoings?"
Micah,6,8,"Yo, listen up! God already told you what's up - He's all about that goodness. So, what does He really want from you? It's simple, my friend: play fair, show some love and kindness, and stay humble while you roll with your God. Trust me, it's a solid way to live life!"
Micah,6,9,"OMG, the LORD is totally calling out to the city! And, like, anyone who's smart will recognize your name. Pay attention to the consequences of your actions, and who's in charge of it all. Like, they've got it all figured out, ya know."
Micah,6,10,"Is the wicked dude still hiding his sketchy stash, and using a trashy measuring cup? Like, seriously? Gross!"
Micah,6,11,"Like, can I even consider them totally innocent when they're using sketchy scales and deceptive weights? Nah, that's not cool. 🙅‍♂️"
Micah,6,12,"Like, those rich kids are always causing trouble, and everyone in that place never tells the truth - they be straight up lying! And don't even get me started on how they talk, so fake and filled with deceit."
Micah,6,13,"So, like, I'm totally gonna give you a reality check, and things are gonna get really messed up for you because of all the wrong choices you've been making."
Micah,6,14,"You'll chow down, but won't feel satisfied; you'll be feeling down and out; you'll try to hold on, but won't succeed; and whatever you manage to grasp will end up being taken by the sword."
Micah,6,15,"You can plant, but you won't harvest; you can press olives, but won't pamper yourself with oil; and you'll have sweet wine, but can't enjoy it."
Micah,6,16,"You guys seriously follow the same old rules as those before you like Omri, and you're even imitating the messed-up ways of the house of Ahab. It's totally gonna lead to your destruction, with everyone making fun of you. So yeah, get ready for all the shame and criticism from my peeps."
Micah,7,1,"OMG, I'm soooo screwed! It's like, when you're hyped for all the juicy snacks after summer, but it turns out there's nothing left but scraps. My heart aches for that sweet first bite. #totalbummer"
Micah,7,2,"The righteous dude is like gone from the earth: and seriously, there's not a single person keeping it real: they're all out here plotting to shed blood, straight up hunting down their own peeps with mad traps. #NoGoodOnesLeft"
Micah,7,3,"They're totally into doing bad stuff, like super passionately, you know? The prince is all like, 'Yo, gimme something in return,' and the judge is like, 'I need a little bribe, bro.' Even the big shots are openly expressing their wicked desires. They're totally owning it, man."
Micah,7,4,"The top performers among them are like annoying stickers, and the most honorable ones are even more irritating than a prickly bush. The time will come when your guards and your inspections will cause confusion and distress to all. Brace yourselves for tough times ahead."
Micah,7,5,"Don't fully trust your friends, don't put blind faith in your mentors: Be mindful of what you share with those close to you."
Micah,7,6,"It's like, sometimes the son disrespects his dad, the daughter clashes with her mom, and even the daughter-in-law can't get along with her mother-in-law. It's crazy, but sometimes the people who give you the hardest time are the ones you live with."
Micah,7,7,"So I'm gonna turn to the LORD, you know? I'll be patiently waiting for the God who saves me, 'cause my God won't let me down. He'll totally listen to me, no doubt."
Micah,7,8,"Don't even think about celebrating my downfall, you enemy of mine! When I stumble, I'll get back up and when I'm stuck in the dark, the LORD will shine His light on me."
Micah,7,9,"I'll face the heat from the LORD because I messed up and sinned against him. But wait, he's got my back! He'll defend me and make things right. He'll shine a light on me and I'll witness his righteousness in action."
Micah,7,10,"And when my enemy sees this, shame will consume her. She used to taunt me, asking where my God was. Well, she's about to witness the truth with her own eyes. She'll be crushed like dirt on the streets."
Micah,7,11,"When your walls are getting rebuilt, the rules will totally change."
Micah,7,12,"On that day, he'll totally come to you from Assyria, and from all those cool fortified cities, and from the super strong fortress all the way to the river, and from one sea to another, and from mountain to mountain. (And when I say 'fortified cities,' I mean all the way to those awesome fortified cities.)"
Micah,7,13,"But the land is gonna be totally wrecked because of the people living there and all the messed up stuff they're doing. For real though, their actions are gonna have some serious consequences."
Micah,7,14,"Take care of your squad with your authority, the crew that's got your back, living solo in the trees, chilling in the heart of Carmel. Let them vibe in Bashan and Gilead, just like back in the day. (Take care: or, Lead)"
Micah,7,15,"When you finally escape Egypt, I'm gonna blow your mind with some seriously epic stuff."
Micah,7,16,"When the whole world sees what they can do, they'll be totally shook: they'll be speechless, in total shock, unable to hear a thing."
Micah,7,17,"They'll be down on the ground like a snake, slithering out of their hiding places like earthworms. They'll be scared of the LORD our God and freaked out because of you. {worms: or, creeping things}"
Micah,7,18,"Like, OMG, there's legit no one as amazing as you, God! You're, like, so forgiving and chill about all our wrongs. You totally let go of the bad stuff we do, 'cause you're all about that mercy vibe. #NoAngerForever #MercyGang"
Micah,7,19,"He'll come back, show us some love; He'll conquer our wrongdoings; and you'll throw all their sins deep into the ocean."
Micah,7,20,"You'll totally come through for Jacob and show mad love to Abraham, just like you promised our ancestors way back in the day."
Nahum,1,1,"This is the lowdown on Nineveh. It's like, Nahum the Elkoshite had this vision and wrote it down in a book."
Nahum,1,2,"God gets jealous, and the LORD gets revenge; the LORD gets revenge, and gets super angry; the LORD will get payback on those who go against him, and he saves up wrath for his enemies. Godd...: or, The LORD is a jealous God, and a revenger, etc) (gets furious: Heb. that has fury)"
Nahum,1,3,"God isn't quick to get mad, but when He does, He comes in full force. There's no way He'll let the bad guys off the hook. He's got total control over the crazy storms and tornadoes, and the clouds are like His epic footprints."
Nahum,1,4,"He calls out the waves like 'nah, chill fam' and dries up all the rivers. Bashan, Carmel, and Lebanon's finest wither away."
Nahum,1,5,"When God pulls up, the mountains be trembling, and the hills straight up melting, and the whole earth gets lit when he shows up. Like, everything and everyone on this planet can't handle it."
Nahum,1,6,"Like, who even dares to face his rage, man? Like, can anyone survive the intensity of his anger? It's like his fury is literally on fire, and he's not afraid to throw down some rocks, ya know?"
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is awesome, a solid fortress when you're going through tough times; and he totally knows those who have his back."
Nahum,1,8,"But like a massive flood, he's gonna totally wipe out that place, and darkness is gonna chase down his enemies."
Nahum,1,9,"Like, seriously? What do you even think you're doing against the LORD? He's gonna totally wipe you out, and trust me, there won't be any more trouble after that. It's not gonna happen again, no way."
Nahum,1,10,"When they hang out all close like thorns, and get wasted like drunkards, they're gonna get wrecked like super dry stubble."
Nahum,1,11,"Yo, there's this person who's straight up schemin' against the LORD, like a wicked advisor. I mean, we're talkin' wicked levels, like counsellor of Belial and all that. Smh."
Nahum,1,12,"God says: Even if they seem peaceful and numerous, they will be defeated when He comes. Though I have caused you suffering, I will no longer make you suffer."
Nahum,1,13,I'm gonna totally free you from that oppressive burden and shatter your chains into pieces.
Nahum,1,14,"Yo, the Lord just dropped a command about you to stop spreading your name. I'm about to straight up destroy all those idols you worship like graven images and molten ones. I'll make sure you end up in a grave since you're just straight up fake and disgusting."
Nahum,1,15,"Yo, check out the dude bringin' the good news up on the mountain! He's all about spreadin' peace, man! Yo, Judah, make sure you keep celebratin' those important feasts and stay true to your promises. 'Cause listen up, the wicked ones ain't gonna mess with you no more... they're totally gone, bro!"
Nahum,2,1,"Some hardcore destroyer is about to show up right in your face. So, get ready and fortify yourself like a boss. Guard your defenses, stay alert, and make sure you're fully prepared to flex your power. This guy means business, so give it all you've got!"
Nahum,2,2,"Because the LORD has caused Jacob's glory to fade, just like the glory of Israel. The ones who have oppressed them have drained them dry and ruined their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The supersquad's shields are all blood red, the brave ones rockin' scarlet gear. Their rides gonna be lit with fiery torches on the big day, and the forest gonna tremble like crazy. (or dyed scarlet) (or fiery)"
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots will go wild in the streets, smashing into each other on the big roads. They'll look like blazing torches and zoom like lightning bolts. {they: or their appearance: Heb. their show}"
Nahum,2,5,"He'll flex his squad: they'll trip up while strolling; they'll rush towards the wall, fully prepped for protection."
Nahum,2,6,"The rivers will overflow their banks, and the fancy palace will like totally melt away. {melt away: or, turn into goo}"
Nahum,2,7,"And Huzzab will be taken as a prisoner, she will be raised up, and her maidens will guide her with gentle voices, tapping their chests like doves. (Huzzab: meaning something that was once established or stood firm) (taken: or discovered)"
Nahum,2,8,"So like, Nineveh used to be chill and all, like a peaceful pool of water. But now, things are about to go down and everyone's gonna run away. They'll scream like 'stay, stay!' but no one will even bother to look back or turn around."
Nahum,2,9,"Yo, grab that silver and gold loot, cuz there's an endless supply of dope stuff to flex. We talkin' mad glossy furniture and all them fancy items you been eyeing. No cap, it's time to stack up and get that treasure!"
Nahum,2,10,"She's like, totally empty and useless, and everyone's hearts are like melting, and their knees are literally shaking, and there's so much pain in their bodies, and their faces are all like turning super dark."
Nahum,2,11,"Yo, where do those lions chill and hang out, you know? Where do the young lions grab their grub, and where did the OG lion and its little cub roam without anyone bothering them?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion totally destroyed enough food for his cubs, and choked his lionesses' meals, and filled his hiding spots with tons of prey and his dens with delicious feasting."
Nahum,2,13,"Listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, the LORD of all, is coming at ya. He's gonna make those chariots go up in smoke and the sword will gnaw away at your fierce warriors. Your loot will be snatched away, and your messengers won't be heard from again, ya dig?"
Nahum,3,1,"Bruh, this city is messed up! It's like, full of lies and robbery, and people are constantly stealing from each other. It's chaotic and violent, like a city soaked in blood, you feel me?"
Nahum,3,2,"Just imagine the sound: the whip crackin', the wheels clatterin', horses showin' off their moves, and the chariots bouncin' around."
Nahum,3,3,"The horseman is flexing with a badass sword and a shiny spear. And damn, there's a whole bunch of dead bodies and corpses everywhere. It's like a never-ending pile of corpses, they're tripping over each other. The sword is like fiery flames and the spear is like freaking lightning, yo."
Nahum,3,4,"Because this attractive influencer, who indulges in promiscuity and practices witchcraft, has sold out nations with her promiscuity and families with her witchcraft."
Nahum,3,5,"Yo, listen up! The Almighty says I'm coming for you. I'm gonna expose all your wrongdoings for the whole world to see. Your dirty secrets will be out in the open, and everyone will know about your disgraceful actions."
Nahum,3,6,"And I'm gonna totally expose you to some seriously disgusting dirt, making you super gross and making everyone stare at you like you're a total joke."
Nahum,3,7,"And it's gonna go down, like, everyone who sees you is gonna peace out and be like, Nineveh is totally wrecked! Who's gonna feel sorry for her? Where am I gonna find people to comfort you?"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you thinking you're cooler than No, the bustling city by the rivers, surrounded by water, with the sea protecting it as a wall? No Amon was pretty legit."
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia and Egypt were like, totally strong and unstoppable; Put and Lubim had your back, providing some major backup."
Nahum,3,10,"But she got taken away and captured, like, completely sucked into captivity. And to make it worse, her little kids got brutally wrecked in the most visible parts of the city. They even played some crazy game to decide what to do with the important dudes in her crew, and all her VIPs ended up chained up."
Nahum,3,11,"You're gonna get lit, like, absolutely wasted. And you're gonna have to go incognito, like totally disappear. Plus, you'll need to find some inner strength to deal with those haters, you know? They're your enemies."
Nahum,3,12,"All your epic forts will be like super fresh fig trees: if they get shook, they'll totally fall right into the mouth of the snacker."
Nahum,3,13,"Yo, listen up! Your crew right here? They're weak, like total queens. Your turf's defenses are gonna be non-existent, bro. The enemy's gonna walk right in, no problem. And your defenses? They're gonna go up in flames. Sucks to be you."
Nahum,3,14,"Get some water for the attack, strengthen your defenses: go into the mud and stomp on the mortar, reinforce the brick oven."
Nahum,3,15,"You're gonna get roasted by the fire, sliced up by the sword, and totally wrecked like a gnarly cankerworm! Multiply yourselves like cankerworms, multiply yourselves like locusts."
Nahum,3,16,"You've seriously expanded your squad of merchants, like, way beyond what you can even count! But hey, here's the thing...there's this little troublemaker called the cankerworm who's all about causing destruction and then disappearing. Like, talk about annoying, right?!"
Nahum,3,17,"Your crew be swarming like locusts, and your leaders be like boss grasshoppers, chilling in the hedges during the cold days. But when the sun comes up, they bounce outta there, leaving no trace behind."
Nahum,3,18,"Yo, King of Assyria, your shepherds are straight up sleeping on the job. Your nobles are gonna live in the dust, and your people are scattered all over the mountains with no one bothering to gather them up. Real talk."
Nahum,3,19,"No cap, your bruise ain't gonna heal; your wound is straight up gnarly. Everyone who hears about you gonna be clapping and stuff, 'cause like, who hasn't been affected by your wickedness? It's been a constant vibe."
Habakkuk,1,1,"The heavy vibes that Habakkuk, the prophet, peeped."
Habakkuk,1,2,"OMG, like, seriously, God? How much longer do I have to keep freaking out and you won't even listen? I'm literally shouting to you about all this injustice, and you're not even gonna step in and save the day or anything!"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Yo, why you gotta show me all this messed up stuff and make me witness all this suffering? Everywhere I look, there's robbery and violence happening. People out here always starting drama and causing conflicts."
Habakkuk,1,4,"So like, the law is, you know, kind of forgotten, and nobody's doing anything about it. The bad guys are all up in the good guys' business, so obviously the judgments being made are totally messed up and unfair. #justsaying"
Habakkuk,1,5,"Yo, check this out among all the people and be amazed. Because I'm about to do something so mind-blowing in your time that you won't even believe it, even if someone told you!"
Habakkuk,1,6,"Yo, check it out, I'm gonna bring up the Chaldeans, this nation that's all bitter and impulsive. They're gonna roll through the whole land, taking over places that don't even belong to them. (Breadth basically means 'wide', just so you know.)"
Habakkuk,1,7,"They are absolutely intimidating and overwhelming: they'll have complete authority and influence just by being themselves. Their power and dominance will bring about consequences, including the defeat and captivity of their enemies."
Habakkuk,1,8,"Dude, their horses are like legit faster than leopards and more savage than evening wolves. Their horse-riders will totally spread out and come from far away, zooming in like an eagle that's hungry and in a major hurry to grab a meal. (PS: 'fierce' actually means 'sharp' in Hebrew, just FYI)"
Habakkuk,1,9,"They'll come ready for chaos: their expressions fierce like a strong wind, and they'll gather captives like countless grains of sand. (Their fierce expressions will be directed eastward.)"
Habakkuk,1,10,"And they will totally roast the kings, and the princes will be like such a joke to them: they'll make fun of every fortress; like seriously, they'll trash talk it and take it down."
Habakkuk,1,11,"And then his mindset will shift, and he will cross the line, causing harm, wrongly attributing this strength to his deity."
Habakkuk,1,12,"Aren't you, like, eternal and stuff, O LORD my God, my super holy guy? We won't die. LORD, you're totally in charge of handing out judgment, and you're like, the ultimate boss for straightening things out. (mighty...: in Hebrew it means like, a solid rock) (established: in Hebrew it means like, laid the foundation)"
Habakkuk,1,13,"You have like, super pure eyes and stuff, can't even stand to see anything evil. So why do you like, bother looking at those people who are all sneaky and stuff? And how come you stay silent when the bad guys totally crush someone who's way more righteous than them? Like, it doesn't make sense, bro."
Habakkuk,1,14,"And you're making people like fishes in the sea, like creatures that crawl on the ground without any leader? Like, no rules and all that... (btw, crawling can mean moving)"
Habakkuk,1,15,"They use their cool angling skills to catch all of them, trapping them in their epic net and rounding them up like a boss. That's why they're totally stoked and super pumped."
Habakkuk,1,16,"So they flex on their fishing gear, and worship their dope traps; because they bring them mad gains, and endless food. (lit. food that be poppin')"
Habakkuk,1,17,"So, like, are they just gonna give up their plans and not even hesitate to keep on wiping out entire nations?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I'mma get up on my watch, and chill on the tower, and I'll peep to see what he's gonna say to me, and how I'm gonna respond when he corrects me. #SafeSpot #InnerReppin"
Habakkuk,2,2,"And God replied, saying, Record the vision and make it clear on tablets, so that anyone who reads it can understand it quickly and act upon it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"The vision's gonna happen, but it's gonna take its sweet time. Don't worry though, it's gonna come true for sure, just gotta be patient and wait for it."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Yo, check it out, if someone's soul is all high and mighty, they ain't really righteous deep down. But the ones who do what's right and trust in their faith, they gonna live their best life!"
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yeah, because he's all about that wine, he's like super full of himself and never stays home. His cravings are like endless, seriously like hell, and he's as relentless as death. He can never get enough, always wanting more. He's like gathering up all the nations and hoarding all the people. Like, seriously!"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Yo, won't everyone be throwing shade at this dude and spitting out some sick burns like, 'Damn, you're in trouble for trying to get what's not rightfully yours!' How much longer are you gonna keep piling on that fake and worthless stuff? Like, seriously, dude?"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Are you seriously not expecting someone to come out of nowhere and drag you down? Like, imagine someone waking up just to mess with you, and then you end up being their entertainment. Serves you right, honestly."
Habakkuk,2,8,"Yo, since you went and wrecked a bunch of nations, now those who are left are gonna wreck you. It's payback time for all the blood you spilled and all the violence you caused in the land, the city, and everywhere else."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Dang, that guy who's all greedy for the wrong reasons, just trying to build his fancy pad up in the sky, thinking it's gonna save him from all the bad stuff! Like dude, seriously?"
Habakkuk,2,10,"Bruh, you messed up big time by messing with so many people, now you've messed up your own soul too."
Habakkuk,2,11,"The brick will literally start screaming and the plank of wood will be like, 'Yo, I got this!' like they do their thing. And their actions will totally expose the wrongdoing."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Dude, seriously messed up vibes to the one who constructs a town through violence, and establishes a city by doing shady stuff! Like, so not cool, bro!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Yo, isn't it the Lord of all that the peeps gotta grind in the blazing fire, only to tire themselves out for no reason? Like, is it all in vain or what?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"Yo, like, the whole earth gonna be flooded with the knowledge that the LORD is straight up glorious, you know? It's gonna be like the waters covering the sea, no doubt. #knowledge #glory"
Habakkuk,2,15,"How bad it is for someone who gets their neighbor drunk and tries to take advantage of them, just to get a peek at their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"You're totally humiliated instead of being honored. Indulge yourself and let your secrets be exposed. The consequences of your actions will catch up to you, and you'll be left feeling disgusting and embarrassed instead of glorious."
Habakkuk,2,17,"Dude, Lebanon's intense force will totally engulf you, and you'll be left with the loot that even wild animals were scared to touch. It's all because of the bloodshed caused by people, and the extreme violence in the whole land, including the cities and everyone living there."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What's the point of making a carved or molten image, relying on it as if it's some wise teacher, when in reality it's just a useless idol? Seriously, why bother with these things?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"It's a total disaster for anyone who thinks a piece of wood can wake up or a dumb stone can miraculously start teaching! Look, they've even covered it in gold and silver, but it's lifeless—it can't even breathe!"
Habakkuk,2,20,"Yo, the LORD is straight up chilling in his holy temple, so like, everyone on the earth better just zip it and show some respect, ya feel? No need for all that noise, just embrace the silence and acknowledge his presence, bro. #humblevibes"
Habakkuk,3,1,"A lit prayer by Habakkuk, the prophet, with sick beats. {according to the rhythm...: or, like different cool songs, or, sick tunes, called in Hebrew, Shigionoth}"
Habakkuk,3,2,"OMG, God, I totally heard what You said and it was pretty intense! Please, God, bring back that awesome stuff You've been doing in the world, like, right now. Let everybody know what You're up to, even when things are super tough. And, like, show mercy, even when You're all mad and stuff."
Habakkuk,3,3,"Yo, God pulled up straight from Teman, and the Holy One was flexin' on mount Paran. Selah. His glory was takin' over the whole sky, and the earth was lit with his praise. {Teman: or, the south}"
Habakkuk,3,4,"And he was shining brightly, like a lit-up selfie; he had some epic-looking spikes coming out of his hand: and that's where his massive power was concealed. (spikes...: or, cool rays shooting out of his side)"
Habakkuk,3,5,"The pestilence zoomed ahead of him, and blazing fireballs shot out from his kicks. {coals: or, diseases}"
Habakkuk,3,6,"He, like, totally stood up and like measured the entire earth. And, he like looked and separated the nations, and even the mountains that have been there forever got scattered, and the hills bent down. His ways are like, totally forever and ever, you know?"
Habakkuk,3,7,"I saw the tents of Cushan totally struggling: and the curtains of the land of Midian were shaking. Cushan, which is like Ethiopia, was going through some tough times, and it was definitely not cool. And the situation over in Midian was just as shake-worthy. It was a pretty intense scene overall, no doubt about it."
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was God mad at the rivers? Like, did He have some beef with them? Was He furious at the sea that He decided to ride on His dope horses and in His rad chariots of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"Your bow was so on point, like, totally exposed, just like the promises you made to the tribes, you know, your word, fam. Selah. Dude, you straight-up split the earth with rivers. Like, rivers flowing all over the place, representing the earth and stuff."
Habakkuk,3,10,"Yo, when the mountains peeped at You, they straight-up shivered. And when the floodwaters rolled through, they couldn't even handle it. The deep sea started bossing up, raised its voice, and threw its hands up in the sky."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stayed put in their spots: they moved forward when your arrows lit up the sky and your shiny spear gleamed. (or, your arrows walked in the light)"
Habakkuk,3,12,"You totally stormed through the whole land, absolutely furious! You totally dominated and took down those nations in a fit of anger."
Habakkuk,3,13,"You went out to save your people, yes, salvation for your chosen one. You dealt a blow to the leader of the evildoers and exposed their foundation. Selah. (by revealing their truth from the depths to the top.)"
Habakkuk,3,14,"You totally wrecked their leaders with your powerful moves, and they came after me like a wild storm, all hyped up and ready to tear me apart. They were so stoked about hurting the helpless, like they wanted to do it all sneaky and lowkey."
Habakkuk,3,15,"You totally rode through that sea with your horses, maneuvering through that massive water pile-up like a boss. And yeah, we know it was like a muddy situation too."
Habakkuk,3,16,"When I heard it, my stomach shook; my lips started trembling because of what I heard. I felt weakness deep down in my bones, and I couldn't help but shake, hoping for some peace during these troublesome times. When he comes with his gang, it's gonna be chaos and destruction, tearing them apart."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Even if the fig tree doesn't bloom, and there's no fruit on the vines. The olive crop may fail, and the fields won't yield food. The flocks might be cut off from the fold, and there won't be any cattle in the stalls."
Habakkuk,3,18,"But fam, I'mma straight up be hype about the LORD, like straight joyous about my salvation from God."
Habakkuk,3,19,"The LORD God is like my ultimate power booster, he's gonna give me quick and nimble feet like a fancy deer, and he's gonna make me saunter on the highest spots. Shoutout to the main singer who rocks the strings on my instruments."
Zephaniah,1,1,"So, like yo, the message from the LORD that Zephaniah, who's the son of Cushi, yo, and the grandson of Gedaliah, yo, and the great-grandson of Amariah, yo, and the great-great-grandson of Hizkiah, yo, got in the days when Josiah, who's the son of Amon, was king of Judah, yo."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I'm gonna totally wipe out everything from this land, says the LORD. I'm gonna completely get rid of everything, like no joke. This land is gonna be completely wiped out."
Zephaniah,1,3,"I'm gonna wipe out humans and animals. Birds in the sky, fish in the sea, and even those idols that lead people astray - they're all gonna be gone. No more humans on this land, says the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,4,"I'm gonna come at Judah and all the people in Jerusalem, and I'm gonna wipe out that leftover Baal stuff in this area. Say goodbye to the Chemarims and the priests too!"
Zephaniah,1,5,"Those who flex their admiration for the stars on social media rooftops; and those who obsess over trends and swear by the LORD, and swear by their latest idol;"
Zephaniah,1,6,"And those who have like, totally ditched the Lord and didn't bother to seek Him or ask Him anything."
Zephaniah,1,7,"Stay silent when the Almighty God is around, because Judgment Day is right around the corner. The Lord has arranged a special event and invited his chosen ones to be there."
Zephaniah,1,8,"On the day when the LORD unleashes His power, He's gonna teach those high and mighty peeps and even the royal fam a lesson. Also, anyone who's rocking some weird fashion choices better watch out too. God's not playing around, fam. 👑⚡"
Zephaniah,1,9,"On that very same day, I'll totally call out all those dudes who disrespectfully invade people's personal space, you know, like jumping on their doorsteps and stuff. They think it's cool to bring chaos and shady behavior into their bosses' crib. Well, I'm about to put an end to that real quick."
Zephaniah,1,10,"And like, on that day, says the LORD, there's gonna be, like, this intense crying sounds coming from the fish gate, and, like, a bunch of howling from the second gate, and, dude, a major crashing noise from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"OMG, listen up peeps in Maktesh, it's like a major bummer - all the traders are totally wiped out, and those with cash are 100% gone."
Zephaniah,1,12,"Yo, when the time comes, I'll light up Jerusalem with some lit candles and call out the guys who are all chill doing nothing: the ones who think in their hearts that the LORD won't bring blessings or consequences. (settled: like when curds get thickened, you know?)"
Zephaniah,1,13,"So, like, their stuff is gonna be taken away, and their houses will be all abandoned and stuff. They'll try to build houses, but they won't even get to live in them, you know? And they'll plant vineyards, but won't get to enjoy the wine from them."
Zephaniah,1,14,"Yo, the big day of the LORD is like, right around the corner, like super close and coming at us real fast, you know? It's gonna be intense, like the sound of that day of the LORD is gonna be so powerful, like loud AF, ya know? Even the toughest dudes gonna be crying like crazy over there, like real intense tears and stuff, man."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is like, super intense and stuff. It's gonna be all about wrath, trouble, distress, wasteness, desolation, darkness, gloominess, clouds, and like, super thick darkness and all that jazz."
Zephaniah,1,16,"Get ready for a major wake-up call that's gonna rock the fortified cities and shake those tall, mighty towers!"
Zephaniah,1,17,"I'm gonna make people really stressed out, so much so that they'll stumble around like they can't see anything, all because they messed up and went against the Lord. They're gonna suffer big time, with their blood being spilled like dust and their bodies ending up like garbage on the ground."
Zephaniah,1,18,Their fancy money won't save them when the big man upstairs unleashes his anger and burns up the whole land. He's gonna quickly wipe out everyone living there.
Zephaniah,2,1,"Yo, come together, like seriously, everyone gather up! We're talking to the nation that feels left out or unwanted. You know, the one that's not exactly on everyone's wishlist. But hey, we still want you here!"
Zephaniah,2,2,"Yo, peep this before it goes down - before the sun sets and it's all just irrelevant noise, before God's lit anger hits you like a ton of bricks, before His day of wrath goes down."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Yo, all you chill peeps on this planet, listen up! If you've been doing right by the Big Guy upstairs, then it's time to reach out to Him. Look for goodness, look for humility, and who knows? He might just keep you safe when things go south and His wrath hits the fan."
Zephaniah,2,4,"Gaza's gonna be ghosted, Ashkelon will be a total wasteland. They'll straight up kick Ashdod out in broad daylight, and Ekron's gonna get demolished."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Oh no, the people living by the sea, the Cherethites! The LORD is bringing some serious trouble your way. Canaan, the land of the Philistines, you're about to be completely wiped out, with no one left to live there."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And like, the beach will become, like, totally rad hangouts for shepherds with their chill little cabins and cozy spots for their flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,And the cool beach vibes will be for the leftover squad from the house of Judah; they gonna chill and hang there: they'll crash in the hip houses of Ashkelon at sunset. 'Cause the LORD their God is gonna show up and set them free from their troubles.
Zephaniah,2,8,"So, like, I totally heard those haters from Moab and the kids from Ammon talking smack about my peeps and straight up flexing on their boundaries."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Alright, listen up folks! This is a message straight from the Almighty God of Israel, the big boss up there. Let me tell you something, Moab is gonna be just like Sodom, and the Ammonites - yup, they're gonna be like Gomorrah. Total mess, I tell ya, with all kinds of wild plants and salty pits. It's gonna be an everlasting wasteland. But don't fret, 'cause the leftovers of my people are gonna swoop in and raid 'em. We'll take 'em over, piece by piece."
Zephaniah,2,10,"They will suffer the consequences of their arrogance, because they have insulted and belittled the people of the LORD of hosts."
Zephaniah,2,11,"The LORD is gonna be absolutely savage towards them: he's gonna totally knock out all the fake gods on the planet, and people are gonna worship him, no matter where they are, even in the farthest corners of the world."
Zephaniah,2,12,"Yo, Ethiopians, y'all are about to get wrecked by my sword."
Zephaniah,2,13,"And he's gonna flex on the north, wreck Assyria, and turn Nineveh into a total ghost town, all dried up like a barren desert."
Zephaniah,2,14,"And there will be animals resting in her midst, creatures from all nations: both the cormorant and the bittern will find shelter on the top of it; their voices will sing through the windows; devastation will be at the entrance: for he will reveal the beautiful craftsmanship. (cormorant: or, pelican) (top...: or, knobs, or, capitals) (for...: or, when he has revealed)"
Zephaniah,2,15,"This city used to be so lit, living its best life without care, thinking it's the only one that matters. But now, it's all messed up and abandoned, a place where wild animals chill. Everyone who sees it will be like 'damn' and shake their heads."
Zephaniah,3,1,"How messed up and corrupted is that city, the one that's all about indulgence and oppressing others! Like, seriously, it needs a reality check. #NotCool"
Zephaniah,3,2,"She totally ignored what she was told; she refused to listen to any advice; she didn't have faith in the LORD; she never even bothered to connect with her God. {or, instruction: as in, she rejected any guidance}"
Zephaniah,3,3,"The leaders in her city are fierce lions, while the judges are like hungry wolves that don't wait till morning to devour their prey."
Zephaniah,3,4,"The prophets are so fake and unreliable, like, they can't be trusted. And don't even get me started on the priests—they've totally messed up the holy place and have completely disregarded the laws."
Zephaniah,3,5,"The righteous LORD is always present there; he never does anything wrong. Every morning he reveals his justice, and he never fails. But the wicked have no shame and don't learn from their mistakes. (Every morning like clockwork)"
Zephaniah,3,6,"I totally wrecked those nations, bro. Their fancy towers? Yeah, they're abandoned and lonely now. I turned their streets into ghost towns, no one even walks by anymore. Their cities? Completely wiped out, no sign of life or peeps living there. Oh, and those 'towers' can also mean 'corners' – just saying."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I was like, for sure you'd show me some respect and learn something from me, so that your place wouldn't get wrecked when I had to teach you a lesson. But no, you had to wake up early and mess everything up."
Zephaniah,3,8,"So, like, listen up, God's saying to chill and hang tight until the day I make my move and bring the heat. I'm all about bringing together nations and kingdoms, and pouring out my righteous anger on them, because the entire earth will be consumed by my passionate jealousy."
Zephaniah,3,9,"Yo, I'mma give the people a straight up clean and easy language, so they can all hit up the LORD's name and worship Him together. Let's be real, we gotta serve Him with unity and agreement."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From way out in Ethiopia, my peeps - even my scattered homies - will come through with their offerings."
Zephaniah,3,11,"On that day, you won't have to feel embarrassed about everything you've done wrong against me. I'll remove those who take pleasure in your arrogance from among you, and you won't feel so high and mighty because of my sacred mountain anymore. {because...: Hebrew: on my holy}"
Zephaniah,3,12,"I'll keep a bunch of folks who are going through hard times and struggling around you, and they'll put their faith in the Lord's name."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remaining squad of Israel won't be doing any shady stuff or spread lies; they won't be caught with a fake tongue. They'll be chilling, enjoying their meals and naps, with nobody causing them fear."
Zephaniah,3,14,"Yo, daughter of Zion, let your voice be heard; shout it out, Israel! Get stoked and rejoice with all your heart, girl from Jerusalem!"
Zephaniah,3,15,"Yo, the LORD has totally wiped out any judgments against you, and he straight up kicked your enemy to the curb. The king of Israel, aka the LORD himself, is right there with you, like right in the mix. From now on, you ain't gonna see no evil, like not even once."
Zephaniah,3,16,"When that time comes, people will say to Jerusalem, 'Don't be afraid,' and to Zion, 'Don't give up.'"
Zephaniah,3,17,"God, like, super powerful, is with you, and he's gonna save you. He's gonna be so pumped about you, like, seriously filled with joy. He'll just chill and soak up his love for you, and even sing songs of happiness about you."
Zephaniah,3,18,"I'll bring together all the peeps who be feeling down for the lit gathering, the ones who rock with you and have been carrying the weight of the haters. It's time to lose that burden, fam!"
Zephaniah,3,19,"Yo, listen up! When that time comes, I'm gonna totally fix up everything that's been giving you a hard time. I'll save those who are struggling, bring back those who were rejected, and make sure everyone knows how awesome they are. They'll get praised and famous in all the places where they were once embarrassed."
Zephaniah,3,20,"When that moment comes, I'll bring you back together and gather you up. I'm gonna make you famous and respected by everyone on this planet. You'll see me restore your freedom right before your eyes, says the LORD."
Haggai,1,1,"In the chat slang of year two of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the LORD slid into Haggai's DMs and sent him a message for Zerubbabel (who was like the boss of Judah) and Joshua (the head priest), like, you know? It was all like, 'Hey guys, listen up!'"
Haggai,1,2,"Yo, listen up, the big man upstairs, the LORD of hosts, is saying this: These people I deal with are straight up saying it's not the right time to build the LORD'S house."
Haggai,1,3,"So, like, the LORD spoke to Haggai, the prophet dude, and was like,"
Haggai,1,4,"Yo, is it like, time for y'all to be chillin' in your fancy houses, while this house is just like, abandoned and neglected?"
Haggai,1,5,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord of all the squads has to say: Think about the choices you're making, fam. Set your heart on the path you're walking. #DeepThoughts"
Haggai,1,6,"Ya'll been grinding hard, hustling and putting in work, but the results just don't match up. You're eating, but still feeling unsatisfied; drinking, but never feeling fully quenched. You're dressing up, but still feeling that chill. And whatever money you're making, it's like putting it straight into a bag full of holes. Like, it's just slipping through your fingers."
Haggai,1,7,"Yo, listen up, says God Almighty. Take a moment to think about your actions. {Think about...: Yo, set your heart on what you've been doing}"
Haggai,1,8,"Yo, head up to the mountain and grab some wood, then start building the house. And trust, I'll be stoked about it and I'll be straight flexin', says the LORD."
Haggai,1,9,"You were expecting so much, but it turned out to be way less than you hoped. And when you finally got it, I just blew it away. So why did that happen? asks the LORD of all. It's because my house is left in ruins, while you all selfishly focus on your own homes."
Haggai,1,10,"So like, the sky above you won't give you any dew, and the earth won't give you any fruit."
Haggai,1,11,"I made it stop raining everywhere, on the mountains, and on the crops, and on the fresh wine, and on the oil, and on anything that grows on the ground, and on people, and on animals, and on all the hard work people do."
Haggai,1,12,"So Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's son, and Joshua, Josedech's son, who was the high priest, along with everyone else who was left, listened to what the Lord their God said. They also heeded the wise words of Haggai the prophet, just as the Lord their God had instructed. And let me tell you, the people definitely had a healthy respect for the Lord."
Haggai,1,13,"So Haggai, the LORD's messenger, delivered a message from the LORD to the people, and he said, 'I've got your back, fam,' says the LORD."
Haggai,1,14,"And God gave Zerubbabel, who was in charge of Judah, and Joshua, the high priest, as well as all the remaining people, the motivation they needed to come together and get to work on building the house of the LORD, which is their God."
Haggai,1,15,"On July 24th, in the second year of King Darius."
Haggai,2,1,"On the 21st day of the seventh month, the LORD spoke to the prophet Haggai, saying,"
Haggai,2,2,"Yo, listen up Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, who's running the show in Judah, and Joshua, son of Josedech, the top priest, and all the other peeps out there, here's the word."
Haggai,2,3,"Yo, who's still around here that actually saw this sick house back in the day when it was looking fly af? And now, how does it even measure up? To be honest, doesn't it look like absolute trash compared to how it used to be?"
Haggai,2,4,"But yo, Zerubbabel, listen up! The LORD is sayin', you gotta stay strong, aight? And Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, you too gotta stay strong. And yo, all y'all people out there, the LORD is sayin' the same thing to you, stay strong and get to work! Why? 'Cause I'm rollin' with you, says the LORD of hosts."
Haggai,2,5,"Yo, remember that promise I made with y'all when you dipped from Egypt? Well, just so you know, my spirit is still with you. Don't trip, there's nothing to fear."
Haggai,2,6,"Listen up, fam! This is what the big man upstairs has to say: In just a hot minute, I'm gonna shake up everything. I'm talking about the sky, the earth, the ocean, and even the barren lands. It's gonna be lit!"
Haggai,2,7,"And like, I'm gonna totally shake things up in every nation, and all the cool stuff that everyone's been hoping for is gonna happen. And trust me, I'm gonna fill this house with so much epicness and glory, says the LORD of hosts."
Haggai,2,8,"I totally own all the cash and bling, says the LORD who's in charge of everything."
Haggai,2,9,"God says that the awesomeness of the new crib will totally outshine the old one, and this place is where I'm gonna bring the chill vibes, says the LORD."
Haggai,2,10,"On November 24th, in the second year of Darius, the LORD spoke through the prophet Haggai, and this is what He said,"
Haggai,2,11,"Yo, listen up! The LORD of all the hosts has something to say. Go ahead and hit up the priests with your questions about the law, you know what I'm saying?"
Haggai,2,12,"If someone carries a holy item in their pocket or bag, and it accidentally touches bread, soup, wine, oil, or any food, does that food become holy too? The priests replied, nah, it doesn't."
Haggai,2,13,"Haggai was like, yo, if someone who's touched a dead body gets all up on these things, are they gonna be contaminated? And the priests were like, yeah, definitely gonna be contaminated."
Haggai,2,14,"Haggai came back with a reality check and said, 'This is how it is with these people and this nation in my eyes,' says God. 'Everything they do, all their handiwork, is just not up to par. And even the things they bring as offerings are tainted.'"
Haggai,2,15,"Yo, listen up! I really hope you take a moment to think about what I'm about to say. Imagine going back to the very beginning, before a single building block was placed in the Lord's temple..."
Haggai,2,16,"Back in the day, when you found a stash of twenty snacks, there were only ten left. And when you went to get fifty drinks out of the fridge, there were only twenty left."
Haggai,2,17,"I wreaked havoc on your grind with bad luck, mold, and hail, messing up everything you worked for, but instead of changing your ways, you turned a blind eye to me, says the LORD."
Haggai,2,18,"Yo, listen up starting from today, specifically from the 24th day of the ninth month, when they laid the foundation of the Lord's temple, pay attention to it."
Haggai,2,19,"Is the seed still chillin in the storage? Nah, the vine, fig tree, pomegranate, and olive tree haven't popped off yet. But starting from today, I'm gonna hook you up with some blessings, fam."
Haggai,2,20,"And once again, the LORD spoke to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, yo,"
Haggai,2,21,"Yo, Zerubbabel, the boss of Judah! Listen up, I'm about to rock the whole universe, including the skies and the planet Earth!"
Haggai,2,22,"I'm gonna totally wreck the rulers and their fancy kingdoms, obliterate their armies and their snazzy chariots, and make 'em all fight against each other 'til they're donezo, bro."
Haggai,2,23,"Yo, listen up! When that day comes, the Almighty says I got you, Zerubbabel, my homie, Shealtiel's kid. Yeah, that's right, says the LORD. I'm gonna make you like a dope symbol, cuz I picked you, says the Almighty."
Zechariah,1,1,"In like, the eighth month of this sick year (shoutout to Darius), God straight-up hit up Zechariah, son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo, the OG prophet, and dropped some knowledge."
Zechariah,1,2,"God was really upset with your ancestors. (like, super mad)"
Zechariah,1,3,"So, tell them this message from the Almighty: Yo, come back to me, says the Almighty, and I'll totally come back to you, says the Almighty."
Zechariah,1,4,"Don't be like your old folks, who the OG prophets warned back in the day, saying, 'The big man upstairs is like, yo, change your wicked ways and stop doing bad stuff.' But they straight up ignored me, didn't even bother tuning in, God says."
Zechariah,1,5,"Yo, where are your ancestors at, and the prophets, are they immortal or what?"
Zechariah,1,6,"Yo, dudes, check it out: Did your ancestors not listen when I spoke through my prophets? They realized that the Lord of Heaven's Armies was about to carry out what He said, based on how they were living and what they were doing. And true to His word, He dealt with them accordingly. #Karma"
Zechariah,1,7,"On February 24th, in the second year of Darius, God spoke to Zechariah, who is the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, and said,"
Zechariah,1,8,"So, like, I had this totally crazy vision, right? It was nighttime, and guess what I saw? This dude riding on a sick red horse! And get this, he was standing among these cool myrtle trees at the bottom. But that's not all! Behind him were these other awesome horses, they were red too, but some of them had spots and others were white. How wild is that?!"
Zechariah,1,9,"So I was like, yo, what's up with these things, my dude? And the angel who was chillin' with me was like, I gotchu fam, I'll break it down for you."
Zechariah,1,10,"And the dude chilling among the myrtle trees was like, 'Yo, these are the peeps that the LORD sent to roam around the earth.'"
Zechariah,1,11,"So, like, they were all talking to the angel of the LORD who was just chilling among the myrtle trees, and they were like, 'Dude, we've totally been roaming around the earth, and guess what? The whole earth is just, like, super calm and peaceful right now.'"
Zechariah,1,12,"And the angel of the LORD was like, yo O LORD, how much longer you gonna be tough on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah? You've been mad at them for like seventy years, man!"
Zechariah,1,13,And God replied to the angel I was talking to with kind and reassuring words.
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel was like, 'Yo, listen up! Tell everyone this message from the LORD of all: I'm totally, like, super protective over Jerusalem and Zion and I'm, like, crazy passionate about it.'"
Zechariah,1,15,"And I'm super mad at those clueless peeps who are living it up without a care. I was only a little mad, and they totally made the situation worse."
Zechariah,1,16,"So, here's the deal: God's like, 'Listen up! I'm back in Jerusalem, ready to show some mad love and kindness. My crib is gonna be rebuilt, you dig? The LORD almighty said it, so you know it's legit. And get this, a fresh and straight-up line is gonna be drawn all over Jerusalem.'"
Zechariah,1,17,"Yo, listen up! The LORD of hosts is like, 'Yo, don't even trip. My cities are gonna thrive and spread big time. And fosho, the LORD's gonna bring the comfort to Zion and be all about choosing Jerusalem. No doubt, prosperity gonna be rollin' in. #blessed"
Zechariah,1,18,"So I looked up and saw this crazy sight, there were these four horns. Like, what even?!"
Zechariah,1,19,"So I asked the angel chillin' by my side, 'Yo, what's up with these things?' And the angel goes, 'These are the horns that messed up Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.'"
Zechariah,1,20,"So like, God totally showed me these four super skilled carpenters, you guys."
Zechariah,1,21,"I was like, yo, what's the deal with these horns? And then he was like, listen up, these horns are the ones that messed up Judah, making everyone feel down. But guess what? These horns are here to scare them off, to kick out those other horns from foreign folks who tried to mess with Judah and make it all chaotic."
Zechariah,2,1,"So, like, I glanced up once more, and yo, I saw this dude, totally rocking a measuring line in his hand."
Zechariah,2,2,"So I was all like, 'Yo, where you headin' to?' And he's like, 'Dude, I'm goin' to scope out Jerusalem, checkin' out how wide and long it is, you know?'"
Zechariah,2,3,"Yo, listen up! So, like, this angel who was having a convo with me, right? Well, they straight up bounced and saw another angel on their way. They totally bumped into each other, man!"
Zechariah,2,4,"So He told him, 'Yo, go talk to that dude over there and tell him this: Jerusalem is gonna be populated AF, with mad people and livestock, like a bunch of lit towns without walls and such.'"
Zechariah,2,5,"Yo, God here, I got you covered like a lit fire wall around you, and I'll be the absolute flex in your midst."
Zechariah,2,6,"Yo, yo, yo, listen up and bounce outta the north, says the LORD. 'Cause I've spread you all over like the winds blowin' in the sky, says the LORD."
Zechariah,2,7,"Yo, Zion, you better GTFO from Babylon's territory, ASAP."
Zechariah,2,8,"This is what the LORD of all the cool people says; once I've finished showing off, I'll be sent to all the nations that messed with you, 'cause anyone who messes with you is messing with someone super important to him."
Zechariah,2,9,"Yo, check it out, I'm about to flex on these fools. They're gonna get owned by their own peeps. And you'll know that the big man upstairs, the LORD of hosts, sent me."
Zechariah,2,10,"Yo, Zion fam, get hyped and celebrate! 'Cause listen up, I'm about to slide through and make my crib right in the middle of y'all. God's word, no cap."
Zechariah,2,11,"In the future, loads of countries will be down with the LORD and become part of the crew. The LORD will live among us and you'll totally know that the big boss, the LORD of hosts, sent me to you."
Zechariah,2,12,"And God's gonna claim Judah as his piece of the holy land, and he'll pick Jerusalem once more."
Zechariah,2,13,"Yo, everyone, zip it in the presence of the LORD. He's like, totally chillin' in His sacred crib, you know? Respect the holiness, fam. #Humbled"
Zechariah,3,1,"So, like, this dude shows me Joshua, the top priest, standing in front of the angel of the LORD, and Satan is right there next to him, being all oppositional and stuff. (And just to clarify, Satan means he's like an adversary, you know, someone who goes against him.)"
Zechariah,3,2,"And God was like, 'Yo Satan, get rekt! The God who picked Jerusalem is saying 'Get lost, Satan!' Ain't this a rescued soul? #blessed"
Zechariah,3,3,"So, like, Joshua is standing there in these really nasty clothes, you know? And he's right in front of this angel and everything."
Zechariah,3,4,"And then he responded to those who were there, saying, 'Get rid of those gross clothes on him.' And he said to him, 'Look, I've made all your wrongdoings go away, and I'm gonna give you a fresh new outfit.'"
Zechariah,3,5,"And I was like, yo, let's put a dope crown on his head. So they put a rad crown on his head and dressed him up in some sick clothes. And then this lit angel of the LORD showed up."
Zechariah,3,6,"And the angel of the LORD straight up went to Joshua and was like,"
Zechariah,3,7,"Yo, listen up, fam! This is what the LORD of all the cool peeps says: If you rock with my ways and keep it real with my rules, then I'll hook you up with some mad responsibilities. You'll be judging my house, keeping my courts fresh, and I'll even give you VIP access to roll with the crew. It's gonna be lit, ya heard?"
Zechariah,3,8,"Listen up, Joshua the high priest, you and your squad chilling with you, 'cause y'all are like, super impressive dudes. Check this out, I'm about to send my servant, the BRANCH, into the scene. Trust me, it's gonna be mind-blowing!"
Zechariah,3,9,"Yo, check it out! So I'm all about this stone that I put right in front of Joshua. It's like, super special, with seven eyes on it, no biggie. Like, I'm gonna carve some sick design on it, like a boss, says the LORD of hosts! Plus, get this, I'm gonna erase all the bad vibes from that land in just one day. Trust, it's gonna be lit!"
Zechariah,3,10,"On that day, says the LORD, you'll hit up your homies and chill with them under the cool shade of a vine or a fig tree."
Zechariah,4,1,"So, like, this angel dude who was chatting with me, came back and totally woke me up, like when you suddenly wake up from a deep sleep."
Zechariah,4,2,"And they asked me, 'What do you see?' And I replied, 'I see a super cool golden candlestick with a bowl on top, and it has seven lamps and seven pipes for the lamps. It's like so sleek, dude!'"
Zechariah,4,3,"And there were two chill olive trees, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it."
Zechariah,4,4,"So I was like, yo angel dude, I asked him, 'Yo, what's up with all these things, bro?'"
Zechariah,4,5,"So like, the angel who was chillin' and talkin' to me, was like, 'Yo, do you even know what all this is about?' And I was like, 'Nah, dude, I don't have a clue, my lord.'"
Zechariah,4,6,"And he was like, yo dude, listen up! This is what the Lord is saying to Zerubbabel: It ain't about flexing your muscles or showing off your strength. It's all about that divine spirit power, says the mighty Lord!"
Zechariah,4,7,"Yo, who do you think you are, big mountain? Zerubbabel's gonna make you flat ground. And when he lays down the final stone, everyone's gonna be cheering, screaming, 'Amazing, amazing!'"
Zechariah,4,8,"So, like, the LORD hit me up and was like,"
Zechariah,4,9,"Zerubbabel, the real MVP, started building this house and he's gonna be the one to finish it too. And once it's done, you'll totally realize that the LORD of hosts totally sent me to you. No doubt about it."
Zechariah,4,10,"Like, seriously, who's gonna be all like, 'Ew, small things, I don't care'? 'Cause lemme tell ya, those who don't underestimate the small stuff, they're gonna be super hyped. And they're gonna see Zerubbabel holding that bomb dot com tool called 'plummet', along with those seven other wicked dope things. Oh, and those seven things? They're basically the eyes of the LORD, constantly scoping out everything happening on planet Earth. Like, no lie, that's their gig. #SquadGoals, amirite? #AllSeeingEyes"
Zechariah,4,11,"So I was like, dude, what's up with those two olive trees chillin' next to the candlestick? One on the right and one on the left? Like, what's the dealio?"
Zechariah,4,12,"And I replied back to him, saying, 'Yo, what's up with those two olive branches that are spewing out that golden oil through those sick golden pipes? Like, how are they even doing that?'"
Zechariah,4,13,"And he replied to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I was like, Nah, my dude."
Zechariah,4,14,"And he was like, yo, these two guys right here, they the chosen ones, always by the side of the big boss, the Lord of the whole earth. #oilbrothers"
Zechariah,5,1,"So I turned around and raised my eyes, and there it was—a flying scroll!"
Zechariah,5,2,"And he was like, yo what do you see? And I'm like, bro I see this huge flying roll. It's like twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide."
Zechariah,5,3,"And he said to me, look, there's this major curse spreading all over the entire earth: if you steal, you'll be totally cut off, like completely gone on one side, just like that. And if you swear, you'll be totally cut off too, but on the other side, like completely vanished. (By the way, those who steal think they're innocent, like they're not even guilty at all! Can you believe that?!)"
Zechariah,5,4,"Yo, God's like, 'I'm gonna expose those thieves and liars who swear falsely in my name. Their houses gonna be wrecked, burned by this fire that they can't escape. It's gonna consume everything - the wood, the stones, the whole shebang.'"
Zechariah,5,5,"So the angel I was chatting with, like, he left and told me, 'Dude, look up and check out what's happening here.'"
Zechariah,5,6,"So I was like, what's that thing? And he was like, bro, that's an ephah on the move. And he went on to say, yo, that's how they look all over the world, man."
Zechariah,5,7,"Yo, check it out, there was this heavy chunk of lead that got lifted up, and guess what? It representin' a woman chillin' right in the middle of the ephah. No cap, that lead bein' serious heavy, you feel me?"
Zechariah,5,8,"And he was like, 'Yo, this is straight up not cool.' So he chucked it right into the middle of the ephah and then put a heavy lead on top to keep it from escaping."
Zechariah,5,9,"So, I like, totally raised my eyes and checked it out, and, whoa, two women showed up with wings flapping in the wind, like stork wings, you know? And they grabbed this big ol' ephah thing and hoisted it up between the earth and the sky."
Zechariah,5,10,"So I was like, bro, I asked the angel I was talking to, like, yo, where are these guys taking the ephah?"
Zechariah,5,11,"And he was like, 'Yo, we should build a sick house in Shinar, and it's gonna be legit and stand strong on its own foundation."
Zechariah,6,1,"So I turned around and raised my eyes, and saw four cool chariots emerging from between two epic mountains; and these mountains were made of absolute flexin' brass."
Zechariah,6,2,"The first ride had fire-red horses, and the second ride had sleek black horses."
Zechariah,6,3,"And the third chariot had white horses, while the fourth chariot had horses that were a mix of colors - gray and brown. {bay: or, strong}"
Zechariah,6,4,"So, I replied to the angel like, 'Yo, dude, who are these people? Tell me, my lord!'"
Zechariah,6,5,"And the angel was like, 'Yo, listen up. These here are the four spirits of the heavens, you know? They're always chilling with the big man upstairs, the Lord of all the earth, and then they go out and do their thing. It's like they're His wingmen, representing the winds and all that.'"
Zechariah,6,6,The black horses that are there go towards the north; and the white ones follow after them; and the gray ones go towards the south.
Zechariah,6,7,"And the messenger went out and wanted to explore and wander around the world. He said, 'Go ahead, roam around the world.' So they traveled all around the world."
Zechariah,6,8,"And he was like, calling out to me and he was like, yo, listen up! Check it, those peeps heading north, they've like totally chilled my vibe in that direction."
Zechariah,6,9,"Yo, God hit me up like,"
Zechariah,6,10,"Yo, gather up them peeps who were captive in Babylon - y'know, Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah - and make sure to roll up to Josiah's crib, the son of Zephaniah, on the same day."
Zechariah,6,11,"So, like, get some sick silver and gold and make some legit crowns, then put them on Joshua the son of Josedech, the ultimate high priest's head, fam."
Zechariah,6,12,"Yo, go tell him this: The LORD of all the hosts says, check it out, there's this dude whose name is The BRANCH. He's gonna come up from his hood and build the LORD's temple. Yeah, you heard right, like a branch growing up from under him."
Zechariah,6,13,"Yo, this dude gonna straight up construct the Lord's temple. He gonna be all glorious, sitting on his throne, ruling it up. And get this, he gonna be a priest too. They gonna be all about that peaceful vibe together."
Zechariah,6,14,"And the crowns will be given to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen - Zephaniah's son - to remember them in the house of the LORD."
Zechariah,6,15,"And people from far away will come and help build the temple of the LORD. Then you'll know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this will totally happen, if you faithfully listen to what the LORD your God says."
Zechariah,7,1,"So, like, in the fourth year of king Darius, God dropped a message for Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, Chisleu."
Zechariah,7,2,"So, like, they sent Sherezer and Regemmelech to the house of God with their squad to like, pray to the Lord and stuff, you know? #prayerlife"
Zechariah,7,3,"Yo, I gotta talk to the priests up in this house of the LORD of hosts, and the prophets too. Like, should I be crying during the fifth month and isolating myself, just like I've been doing for all these years?"
Zechariah,7,4,"So, like, the LORD of all the cool stuff sent me a message, saying,"
Zechariah,7,5,"Yo, listen up everyone, including the priests! So, when you guys were fasting and lamenting during the fifth and seventh month for a whopping seventy years, did you even do it for me? Like, seriously, did you really fast for me?"
Zechariah,7,6,"And like, when you were grubbing down and guzzling, weren't you just thinking about yourselves? I mean, come on, you totally were, right? Like, no denying it, dudes."
Zechariah,7,7,"Yo, like, didn't you guys even listen to what the LORD was saying through the old-time prophets when Jerusalem was poppin', and everything was going well? I mean, people were chillin' down south and in the surrounding cities, you know?"
Zechariah,7,8,"And God hit up Zechariah like, 'Yo, listen up,'"
Zechariah,7,9,"Yo, listen up! The LORD of hosts has something to say: Be fair and just in your decisions, and show kindness and compassion to each other, fam. Remember, judging with truth is key. #Blessed"
Zechariah,7,10,"Don't be harsh on widows, orphans, foreigners, or those who are poor. And don't even think about plotting something bad against your bros in your heart."
Zechariah,7,11,"But they were like, 'Nah, we don't wanna listen,' and shrugged off any responsibility. They literally covered their ears so they wouldn't have to hear it. #NotInterested"
Zechariah,7,12,"Like, they totally hardened their hearts, like an indestructible rock, so they wouldn't even listen to the law and the words that the LORD of all the digital realms sent through the prophets of the past. And because of that, the LORD of all the digital realms got super mad. Like, major wrath vibes."
Zechariah,7,13,"So like, it's totally happened, right? He like cried out for help and they straight up ignored him. And now they're crying out, but sorry, I'm not about to listen, says the LORD who's got all the power."
Zechariah,7,14,"But I totally wrecked them, like a super intense tornado, and spread them out among all these random nations they had never heard of before. So the land was like totally abandoned after they left, with no one daring to pass through or come back. They straight up destroyed that awesome land that everyone was just dying to chill in. {pleasant...: Like, the land everyone wanted to live in}"
Zechariah,8,1,"And once again, the LORD of hosts slid into my DMs, dropping this message:"
Zechariah,8,2,"Yo, the LORD of hosts be like, I was totally jealous for Zion, like super hardcore jealous, and I was all worked up and furious for her too."
Zechariah,8,3,"Yo, listen up! The word of the LORD goes like this: I'm back in Zion and gonna chill in the heart of Jerusalem. They gonna call Jerusalem a legit city of truth, and the LORD's mountain? Super holy, no doubt!"
Zechariah,8,4,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD Almighty is saying: There will still be old dudes and old ladies chillin' in the streets of Jerusalem, with each of them using a walking stick 'cause they've lived a long, long time. You feel me?"
Zechariah,8,5,"And yo, the city vibes gonna be lit with mad boys and girls straight up having a blast, playing in the streets n' all, ya feel?"
Zechariah,8,6,"Listen up, y'all! The Almighty is saying, if the remaining people of this generation find something amazing, should I, the Almighty, not find it amazing too? That's what the Almighty has to say!"
Zechariah,8,7,"Like, listen up! The LORD who's like, in charge of everything, is gonna rescue my peeps from all over! From the east and west, no doubt! (BTW, that means like, the countries where the sun rises and sets, you know?)"
Zechariah,8,8,"And I'll gather them up, and they'll chill in the heart of Jerusalem: they'll be my crew, and I'll be their God, for real and totally righteous."
Zechariah,8,9,"Okay fam, listen up! The big man upstairs says, 'Yo, keep those hands strong! You're the ones chillin' in the present, hearing these words spoken by the prophets back in the day when they were laying down the foundation of the Lord's house, all to build that sick temple.'"
Zechariah,8,10,"Back in the day, nobody could find a gig, not even animals could get paid. It was chaos everywhere you went because of all the problems. I had everyone turning against each other, no peace for anyone coming or going. It was a tough time, no doubt."
Zechariah,8,11,"But yo, I ain't gonna treat the rest of these folks like I did back in the day, says the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,8,12,"Yo, listen up! It's gonna be lit! The seeds will thrive, the vines will be poppin' with fruit, the ground will yield mad crops, and the heavens will bless us with dew. And best believe, I'll hook up the remaining peeps with all of these blessings, bringing peace along the way."
Zechariah,8,13,"And like, listen up fam, back in the day you guys were mad disrespected by all those non-believers, ya feel me? But don't trip, because I'm about to come through and save the day. You're gonna be straight fire and spread that good vibes all around. No need to stress, just stay strong and keep doing your thing."
Zechariah,8,14,"This is what the LORD of all the squads says: Like, when your ancestors totally ticked me off and I was all ready to serve them a major punishment, I gotta be real with you, I didn't change my mind, says the LORD of all the squads."
Zechariah,8,15,"So, like, I've been totally thinking lately about doing something really awesome for Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Don't even stress, okay?"
Zechariah,8,16,"So this is what you gotta do, okay? Be real with each other, bro. Like, always speak the truth to your homies. And hey, make sure you're all about fairness and bringing peace, especially in your own crew. Trust me, it's all about being honest and chill, man."
Zechariah,8,17,"And don't even think about being mean to your neighbor or telling lies, because I totally can't stand those things, says the LORD."
Zechariah,8,18,"So, like, the message from the big man upstairs hit me up and was like,"
Zechariah,8,19,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of hosts has to say: Don't stress out about fasting in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months. Instead, turn those fasts into celebrations full of joy and good vibes, with some lit parties thrown in. So, here's the deal: prioritize love, truth, and peace, and you'll be set. Peace out!"
Zechariah,8,20,"Yo, listen up! The Almighty says, wait for it, there will be a time when peeps from all over and dwellers of many cities will come together."
Zechariah,8,21,"And the people from one town will go to another, like 'Let's hustle over and pray to the LORD and seek the LORD of hosts. I'm down for that too.'"
Zechariah,8,22,"Yo, a bunch of people and powerful nations will come to the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, to vibe with the LORD and pray. {to pray...: In Hebrew, it means to ask for help face-to-face}"
Zechariah,8,23,"Yo, listen up! The LORD Almighty says, 'In the future, there will be a time when ten dudes from different nations will grab onto the clothes of a Jewish guy and say, 'Let's roll with you, man! We've heard that God is on your side.'"
Zechariah,9,1,"The vibe from the LORD is coming to Hadrach and Damascus will chill out. Everyone's eyes, especially the peeps from all the tribes of Israel, will be looking towards the LORD."
Zechariah,9,2,"And Hamath will be right there, alongside Tyre and Sidon, with all their wisdom."
Zechariah,9,3,"So, Tyrus went ahead and built herself a seriously epic fortress and collected tons of silver like it was nothing, and fine gold was just laying around like dirt on the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,"Yo, check it out, the Lord's gonna totally kick her out, and like, obliterate her power in the sea. She's gonna get straight up devoured by fire, man."
Zechariah,9,5,"When Ashkelon sees what's happening, it's gonna be shook; Gaza's gonna be real sad too, and Ekron, oh man, they're gonna be so embarrassed because their hopes are gonna be shattered. Even the king of Gaza won't make it, and Ashkelon will be deserted."
Zechariah,9,6,"And a person from outside shall live in Ashdod, and I will humble those arrogant Philistines."
Zechariah,9,7,"And I'll totally clean up his act, take away all his gross stuff, like, blood in his mouth, and all his messed up habits, between his teeth, you know? But the ones who stick around, they'll totally be on Team God, and they'll be like the boss of Judah, and Ekron will be like a cool Jebusite."
Zechariah,9,8,"And I'll totally set up camp around my crib, like, totally to protect it from any haters passing by or coming back. Ain't no one gonna mess with them anymore; I've seen it with my own eyes, dude."
Zechariah,9,9,"Yo, daughter of Zion, get hyped! Shout it out, daughter of Jerusalem! Check it, your King is rollin' up to you. He's the real deal, bringin' justice and salvation. And get this, he's keepin' it low-key, ridin' on a donkey, and its lil' baby. #humble"
Zechariah,9,10,"And I'll totally ditch the fancy rides from Ephraim and the horses from Jerusalem, and there won't be any more epic battles. Instead, peace will be the talk of the town even among those who aren't in the know. And this leader will rule all over, from coast to coast and from the river to the farthest corners of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"You know, thanks to our pact sealed in blood, I've totally freed all those locked up without a drop of H2O in that dark hole."
Zechariah,9,12,"Head over to the place where you find strength, all you hopeful peeps! And let me tell you right now, I'm about to give you twice as much as you deserve!"
Zechariah,9,13,"When I've got Judah on my side, decked out with Ephraim's strength, and lifted up your squad, O Zion, against those Greek boys, making you as strong as a fierce warrior's blade."
Zechariah,9,14,"And God will be all like, totally visible and stuff, and his arrow will be all speedy like lightning: and the mighty Lord will blast the trumpet and roll in with epic whirlwinds from the south."
Zechariah,9,15,The Almighty God will have their back; they'll crush and overpower their enemies with sling stones. They'll party hard like they're drunk on wine; they'll be totally satisfied like bowls filled to the brim and the corners of the altar.
Zechariah,9,16,"And the LORD their God will save them on that day, just like a tight-knit crew of people - they're gonna shine like a dope crown, flexin' proud for all to see on his turf."
Zechariah,9,17,"OMG, His goodness is so lit and His beauty is on fleek! Corn will totally make the young dudes hyped, and new wine will get the girls in the mood. Let's get the party started! 💃🕺"
Zechariah,10,1,"When you want it to rain, hit up the LORD during the later rainy season. He'll come through with some lit clouds and heavy showers, making sure every blade of grass in the field gets some. Like, it'll be straight up dazzling, dude. Or you could say, the LORD will bring the thunder and lightning! 🌧️⚡"
Zechariah,10,2,"Yo, those idols be spewing empty words, and the fortune tellers be seeing straight up lies and telling fake dreams. They ain't bringing any real comfort, so they end up wandering around like a lost flock, feeling all messed up 'cause they got no shepherd. (BTW, teraphims are like these ancient idols or figures)"
Zechariah,10,3,"I got really mad at those shepherds and I totally called out the goats. The big man upstairs, the LORD of hosts, checked up on his crew in the house of Judah and turned them into a kickass horse ready to dominate in battle. {punished: Heb. visited upon}"
Zechariah,10,4,"He was the ultimate flex – the cornerstone, the hypebeast nail, the savage battle bow, and the OG oppressor, all in one."
Zechariah,10,5,"And they will be like total badasses, trampling their enemies in the streets during battle. They will fight with so much confidence because the LORD is on their side, and those dudes on horses will be totally embarrassed."
Zechariah,10,6,"And I'll make the house of Judah strong, and I'll save the house of Joseph, and I'll bring them back to their rightful place. 'Cause I feel for them, you know? They'll be like I never even abandoned 'em, 'cause I'm their God, and I'll always listen to 'em."
Zechariah,10,7,"And the people from Ephraim will be unstoppable, feeling as happy as if they were high on some awesome energy drink. Even their kids will witness the epicness and be stoked; their hearts will be filled with joy because of the LORD."
Zechariah,10,8,I'll get their attention and bring them together because I've saved them. And they'll keep growing just like they've been growing.
Zechariah,10,9,"I'm gonna scatter them all over the place, and they'll start thinking about me even in far-off lands. They'll settle down, start families, and come back home."
Zechariah,10,10,"I'll like totally rescue them from Egypt and Assyria, and take them to this rad place called Gilead and Lebanon! There's gonna be no room left for them in {place}."
Zechariah,10,11,"And, like, he's gonna navigate through a major struggle, totally crushing those huge sea waves, causing the rivers to dry up. Then boom, the Assyrians' big ego will be totally shattered, and Egypt's power will fade away."
Zechariah,10,12,"And I will like, totally boost them in the LORD; they'll be flexing and roaming around in his name, declares the LORD."
Zechariah,11,1,"Yo, Lebanon, open up those doors so the fire can consume your cedars."
Zechariah,11,2,"Yo, fir tree, let out a wail 'cause the cedar has fallen; all the big shots are wrecked. Howl, you oaks of Bashan; the protected forest has been brought down."
Zechariah,11,3,"Yo, listen up, the shepherds be crying out, their fame all messed up. Hear the fierce roar of young lions, 'cause Jordan's pride has been wrecked!"
Zechariah,11,4,This is what the LORD my God says: Take care of the squad in a mad way;
Zechariah,11,5,"Those who own them are killing them, but they don't feel any guilt. And those who sell them say, Praisee the LORD, I'm making bank!' Meanwhile, their leaders don't even care about their well-being."
Zechariah,11,6,"Yo, I'm done feeling sorry for the people in this place, says the LORD. Watch this, I'll let everyone get taken over by their neighbors and their own kings. They're gonna wreck the land, and I won't save them from their hands."
Zechariah,11,7,"Yo, I got you guys covered, especially you, my fellow strugglers. I grabbed two sick staffs - one I named Beauty, and the other was Bands (or Binders, you know). Then I hooked up the flock with some dope nourishment, straight up."
Zechariah,11,8,"Yo, I straight up axed three shepherds in just one month; I was so done with them, and they couldn't stand me either. It was like we both had major hate going on, man."
Zechariah,11,9,"I was like, nah, I ain't gonna be your source of food, like, whatever is gonna die, let it die, and whatever needs to be cut off, let it be cut off. And then let the ones left chow down on each other's flesh. {another: or, his fellow, or, neighbor}"
Zechariah,11,10,"So I grabbed my staff, which I named Beauty, and snapped it in half as a way of ending the covenant I had made with everyone."
Zechariah,11,11,"And it was like totally shattered on that day, and all the lowkey sheep that were just vibing with me understood that it was like definitely the legit word of the LORD. Like for real, those poor peeps were totally clued in."
Zechariah,11,12,"Yo, I was like, 'If you guys cool with it, go ahead and give me my payment. If not, then whatever, it's all good.' And guess what? They ended up giving me thirty silver coins as my price. Can't complain, right?"
Zechariah,11,13,"And God was like, 'Yo, throw it to the potter. They thought I had a mad high value, so I got thirty silver coins from 'em. Then I chucked those coins to the potter in the crib of the Lord."
Zechariah,11,14,"So I broke my other staff, the Bands, to end the bond between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,"And God was like, yo listen up, grab yourself the tools of a straight up ridiculous shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to bring forth a shepherd in this land who ain't gonna show any love to the outcasts. They won't care about the young ones, won't bother fixing what's broken, and won't care for those who are just chilling. Instead, they'll feast on the meat of the privileged and tear them apart. It's gonna be wild, fam!"
Zechariah,11,17,"Dang, that idol shepherd who ditches the flock is in for some serious trouble! Like, the sword is gonna slash his arm and right eye, man. His arm's gonna shrivel up and his right eye will go completely dark."
Zechariah,12,1,"Listen up, peeps! The LORD has a message for Israel, straight from the man upstairs who created the whole universe, laid the foundations of the earth, and shaped the very core of human beings within them."
Zechariah,12,2,"Whoa, I'm gonna turn Jerusalem into a mega intense vibe for everyone nearby. Like, when people come and try to attack Judah and Jerusalem, they'll be totally shook. Like, super scared and helpless, ya know? It'll be a total nightmare for them."
Zechariah,12,3,"And like, on that day, I'm gonna make Jerusalem this super intense and heavy thing for everybody, you know? Anyone who tries to mess with it or get involved is gonna totally get wrecked, even if basically the whole world gangs up against it, yo."
Zechariah,12,4,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says, when the time comes, I'm gonna totally blow the minds of every horse and drive their riders crazy. I'm also gonna keep a close eye on the house of Judah, and blind every horse belonging to the people."
Zechariah,12,5,"And the rulers of Judah will be like, 'Dude, the people of Jerusalem are totally my squad! They're like, super strong because of the LORD, the ultimate boss, their God. Like, they've got my back and everything!'"
Zechariah,12,6,"On that day, I'm gonna turn the leaders of Judah into straight fire, like a blazing bonfire in a stack of wood. They're gonna straight up devour all the people nearby, like no one's business. And you know what's the best part? Jerusalem will come back to life and thrive in its rightful place, right there in Jerusalem."
Zechariah,12,7,"Like, the LORD is gonna totally save the tents of Judah first, so that the awesome glory of the house of David and the amazing glory of the peeps in Jerusalem don't start acting all superior and dissing on Judah."
Zechariah,12,8,"On that day, God will protect the peeps of Jerusalem, and even those who may seem weak will become as strong as David. The fam of David will be like God, with the angel of the Lord leading the way. *Note: 'feeble' can also mean 'fallen' - just a heads up."
Zechariah,12,9,"And yo, on that day, I'm straight up gonna wreck any nation dumb enough to mess with Jerusalem."
Zechariah,12,10,"I'm gonna hook up David's fam and the Jerusalem peeps with some serious good vibes and prayers. They're gonna see me, the one they totally hurt, and they're gonna be super sad, like when you lose your bestie or your OG sibling."
Zechariah,12,11,"On that day, there will be a major sadness in Jerusalem, just like the sorrow of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon."
Zechariah,12,12,"And the whole land will be filled with sorrow, each family on their own; the family of the house of David separate, with their spouses separate; the family of the house of Nathan separate, with their spouses separate; (each family on their own...)"
Zechariah,12,13,"The squad of the house of Levi separated, and their partners separated; the squad of Shimei separated, and their partners separated; {of Shimei: or, of Simeon, as LXX}"
Zechariah,12,14,"All the squads left, each squad in their own zone, with their partners in their own zones too."
Zechariah,13,1,"Yo, on that day, there's gonna be a sick fountain unlocked for the homies in the house of David and the fam in Jerusalem. It's gonna wash away all the sin and impurity, ya feel me? {uncleanness: Heb. separation for uncleanness}"
Zechariah,13,2,"And, like, on that day, the LORD of hosts is like, gonna totally erase the names of those fake idols from the land, so nobody will even remember them anymore. And not only that, but I'm gonna make those so-called prophets and their evil spirits leave the land, too."
Zechariah,13,3,"And here's what's gonna go down: If someone starts spitting mad prophetic fire, their own parents will straight up tell them, 'You're not gonna make it, dude! You're straight up lying in the Lord's name.' And you know what? When they go on with their prophecy, their parents will totally call them out and put an end to it."
Zechariah,13,4,"Yo, listen up! In the future, the prophets gonna feel embarrassed about their predictions. They ain't gonna wear no fancy clothes to trick people either. Keeping it real, you know?"
Zechariah,13,5,"But, like, he'll be all like, 'Nah man, I ain't no prophet. I'm just a regular dude who knows his way around tending livestock, ya know? They taught me all about that since I was a youngin'."
Zechariah,13,6,"And someone will be like, 'Yo, why you got those scars on your hands?' And he'll be like, 'These? They're from when my so-called friends betrayed me.'"
Zechariah,13,7,"Yo, sword! It's go time, take down my shepherd and my bro, says the LORD of hosts. When the shepherd gets hit, the sheep will scatter, and I'll protect the little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs, AKA the LORD, has a message for y'all. Here's how it's gonna go down: In the whole land, two-thirds of the people gotta peace out and unfortunately meet their maker. But hey, don't worry, 'cause one-third is gonna survive and stick around. Just keepin' it real, ya know?"
Zechariah,13,9,"And I'll bring like a third of them through some serious stuff, you know? It's like refining silver or testing gold. And they'll totally call out to me, and I'll totally listen to them. I'll be like, 'They're my people!' and they'll be like, 'The LORD is my God!'"
Zechariah,14,1,"Yo, listen up! The day of the LORD is coming, and your loot is gonna be shared right in front of you."
Zechariah,14,2,"Yo, I'm gonna bring all the nations to fight against Jerusalem. They gonna take over the city, loot the houses, and do some messed up stuff to the women. Half the city gonna get captured, but don't worry, the rest of the people gonna stay in the city."
Zechariah,14,3,"And then God's gonna come out and totally wreck those nations, just like how he totally wrecked them in battle before."
Zechariah,14,4,"And on that day, he'll be posted up on the mount of Olives, right in front of Jerusalem on the east side. And guess what? The mount of Olives is gonna split right down the middle, making a huge valley! Half of the mountain will go north, while the other half goes south."
Zechariah,14,5,"And you'll bounce to the cool mountain spots; 'cause the mountains are gonna stretch all the way to Azal: yeah, you'll bounce, just like when you bounced outta there during that crazy earthquake back in the day when Uzziah was king of Judah. And the LORD my God is gonna show up, with all the saints rollin' by your side."
Zechariah,14,6,"And like, in that day, it's gonna be hella weird, you know? The light won't be all bright and shiny, but it won't be super dark either. It's gonna be, like, a mix of both, you feel me? So like, some places will be kind of clear, while others will have this weird thickness in the darkness, you know what I'm saying?"
Zechariah,14,7,"But there's gonna be this one day that only the LORD will know, not day or night. And guess what? When evening rolls around, it's gonna be lit. Like, serious light vibes. Trust."
Zechariah,14,8,"Yo, listen up! When that day comes, water straight outta Jerusalem will be flowin' like crazy. Half of it headin' towards the east, and the other half headin' towards the west. And get this - it's gonna be flowin' nonstop, all year long, whether it's summer or winter. No breaks, fam!"
Zechariah,14,9,"And the LORD will be the ultimate ruler over everyone: on that day, there will only be one LORD, and everyone will know His name."
Zechariah,14,10,"The entire land, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem, will be made level like a plain. It will be raised up and people will live there. This includes the area from Benjamin's gate to the first gate, all the way to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses."
Zechariah,14,11,"And people gonna live there, and no more destruction gonna happen; but Jerusalem gonna be a safe place to live. You know, like a cozy home we can call our own."
Zechariah,14,12,"Dude, brace yourself for the epic smackdown the LORD is about to unleash on those who dared to go against Jerusalem. Picture this: their flesh will literally disintegrate while they're still standing, their eyes will melt away in their sockets, and their tongues will dissolve right in their mouths. It's gonna be a total obliteration!"
Zechariah,14,13,"Yo, it's gonna go down on that day - there's gonna be this big commotion from the LORD, you know? People will be grabbing each other by the hand, but instead of peace, they'll turn on each other. Neighbor against neighbor, it's gonna get real chaotic."
Zechariah,14,14,"And like, Judah's gonna totally go into battle at Jerusalem, and they're gonna gather up all the stuff from the surrounding nations, like mad amounts of gold, silver, and clothes, y'know? It's gonna be epic!"
Zechariah,14,15,"And like, the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals in these tents will totally be affected by this plague, yo."
Zechariah,14,16,"And like, listen up, yo, there's gonna be a time when all the people from different nations who tried to mess with Jerusalem will totally come back every year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and celebrate the super cool feast of tabernacles."
Zechariah,14,17,"And like, if anyone from, like, any family anywhere on earth doesn't go to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, then they won't get any rain, dude."
Zechariah,14,18,"And if the squad from Egypt doesn't show up and join the party, they're gonna miss out on some lit vibes. And as a consequence, it's gonna rain down some heavy punishment on those outsiders who skip out on celebrating the feast of tabernacles. (Translation note: 'that have no' can be interpreted as 'who don't have' in modern lingo)"
Zechariah,14,19,"If any nation refuses to celebrate the feast of tabernacles, they will face consequences, just like Egypt and all other nations."
Zechariah,14,20,"On that day, the horse bling will say 'ALL HAIL THE LORD', and the cooking stuff in the house of the LORD will be as lavish as the offering bowls on the altar. {bells: or, bridles}"
Zechariah,14,21,"Yeah, all the cooking pots in Jerusalem and Judah are gonna be totally sacred to the LORD of hosts. And anyone who wants to make a sacrifice can come and use them to cook their food. Oh, and by the way, in that day there won't be any Canaanites chillin' in the house of the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,1,"Yo guys, listen up! The LORD has a serious message for Israel, and it's coming through Malachi. #divinecommunication"
Malachi,1,2,"Yo, I've totally loved you, says the LORD. But, like, you're over here like, 'Um, when did you love us?' Didn't Esau, like, you know, Jacob's bro? Yeah, well, I totally loved Jacob, no doubt,"
Malachi,1,3,"And I totally despised Esau, and completely destroyed his mountains and his homeland, leaving them abandoned and overgrown with fierce creatures in the untamed wilderness."
Malachi,1,4,"So, Edom thinks they're broke, but they're all like, 'Nah, we'll rebuild and make this place lit again.' But listen up, says the LORD, they can build all they want, but I'm gonna come through and demolish it. People gonna start calling them the sketchy region, and the folks the LORD is super mad at, forever."
Malachi,1,5,"And when you see it with your own eyes, you will declare, 'The Lord is truly amazing, all the way from the borders of Israel.'"
Malachi,1,6,"A son respects his dad and a servant respects his boss. So if I'm like a dad, where's my respect? And if I'm like a boss, where's my fear? This is what the LORD of hosts is saying to you, priests, who disrespect my name. And you're asking, 'Where did we disrespect your name?'"
Malachi,1,7,"You guys are like, serving up some straight-up nasty bread on my altar and have the audacity to be like, 'What did we do wrong?' Well, let me tell you, you're disrespecting the Lord's table and calling it trash. Like, seriously?!"
Malachi,1,8,"If you think offering the blind animals for sacrifice isn't messed up, or offering the lame and sick ones isn't messed up either, then go ahead and offer them to your leader. Will they be impressed with you or accept your gift? That's what the LORD of hosts wants you to know."
Malachi,1,9,"Yo, like, seriously, can you like, ask God to be chill with us? This whole situation is kinda on you guys. Are you really expecting God to care about you? That's what the LORD of hosts is asking. {God: like, the face of God} {by...: like, from your hand}"
Malachi,1,10,"Yo, like, is there anyone among y'all who would shut the doors without a good reason? And y'all ain't even putting any effort into lighting a fire on my altar. I gotta be real with you, I'm not feeling it, says the LORD of hosts. I won't be accepting any offerings from you."
Malachi,1,11,"My name will be lit AF among the whole world, from sunrise to sunset. People from different cultures will show mad respect for my name and offer dope sacrifices. No cap, my name gonna be hella respected among the non-believers, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,1,12,"But y'all have messed it up, by saying, The table of the LORD is disgusting; and the food on it, even the good stuff, is trash."
Malachi,1,13,"So you're like, ugh, can you believe how tiring this is? And you're totally mocking it, says the LORD, like, seriously? You're bringing all messed up, broken stuff as your offering. Do you really think I'll be cool with that? No way, says the LORD."
Malachi,1,14,"But woe to the faker who puts on a show and offers a bad sacrifice to the Lord, even though they have a good one in their possession. I'm a powerful King, declares the LORD of heaven's armies, and my name is respected among all nations."
Malachi,2,1,"Yo, priests! This commandment is specifically for y'all."
Malachi,2,2,"Yo, if you ignore what I'm saying and don't take it seriously, refusing to acknowledge my awesomeness, the LORD of all things cool and powerful is gonna straight up hit you with a serious curse. Your blessings? Yeah, they're gonna be cursed too. And guess what? It's already started, all because you're not paying attention. So, like, listen up and show some respect!"
Malachi,2,3,"Yo, check this out, I'm gonna expose your shady actions and make you face the consequences. Yeah, even the disgusting aftermath of your fancy parties will be right on your faces. And trust me, it's gonna take you down with it."
Malachi,2,4,"And y'all gonna know that I've like totally given y'all this command, so that my forever deal can be with Levi, says the LORD Almighty."
Malachi,2,5,"I had a solid deal with him, guaranteeing a chill and peaceful life. I hooked him up with a healthy dose of fear and respect towards me, making him shake in his boots at the mention of my name."
Malachi,2,6,"He always spoke the truth and never said anything dishonest. He walked with me in peace and fairness, and he helped many people turn away from doing wrong."
Malachi,2,7,"Yo, the priest's gotta be mad knowledgeable and always seekin' the law vibes from his mouth, 'cause he's like the messenger of the LORD of hosts and all that."
Malachi,2,8,"But y'all have totally gone off track; you've got so many people tripping over the law; y'all have messed up the whole deal with Levi, says the LORD of hosts. {tripping over: or, falling in}"
Malachi,2,9,"That's why I've totally made you look like a laughingstock in front of everyone, because you totally haven't followed my ways and have been biased in how you apply the law. #NoChill"
Malachi,2,10,"Don't we all have the same pops? Didn't one big guy create us? Then why are we all backstabbing each other, disrespecting the promises our ancestors made?"
Malachi,2,11,"Judah straight up betrayed us and things got real messed up in Israel and Jerusalem. Like, seriously, they totally disrespected the holiness of our God, who they were supposed to be all about, and they went and tied the knot with someone from a totally different spiritual vibe. Like, what were they thinking, man?!"
Malachi,2,12,"If someone does this, the LORD will totally cancel them, no matter if they're popular or smart, from being part of Jacob's crew. And even those who bring offerings to the LORD won't be spared. {the master...: or, the one who gets up early, and the one who responds}"
Malachi,2,13,"And once again, you're doing this thing where you're like, crying your eyes out, wailing, and making a huge scene when you come before the LORD's altar. It's gotten to the point where He's not even paying attention to your offerings anymore or accepting them happily from you."
Malachi,2,14,"But y'all be like, wait, why tho? It's cuz the LORD has seen all the shady stuff you did to your bae from way back, the one you promised to be loyal to. And even though you did them dirty, they're still your ride-or-die and the person you made a pact with."
Malachi,2,15,"Yo, didn't God create only one woman for Adam? He could've made more, but He wanted them to produce a godly generation. So, watch out and stay faithful to your spouse from when you were young. Don't be disloyal, my dudes!"
Malachi,2,16,"Yo, the LORD, the God of Israel, straight up says that He's not cool with divorces. See, if someone tries to hide their violence under a fancy outfit, that's a major red flag, says the LORD Almighty. So, be careful and don't go betraying each other. Like, seriously, watch your spirit and keep it real."
Malachi,2,17,"You've totally exhausted the LORD with your words. But you're like, 'How did we exhaust {him}?'. Well, it's when you say, 'Everyone who does bad stuff is actually good in the eyes of the LORD and He's totally into it.' Or when you're like, 'Where's the God who brings justice when you need Him?'"
Malachi,3,1,"Listen up, peeps! I'm gonna send my messenger to pave the way for me. The Lord, the one you've been searching for, is gonna pop up in his temple real unexpectedly. He's the real deal, the messenger of the covenant who's got you all hyped. I'm telling you, he's on his way, says the LORD of hosts."
Malachi,3,2,"Yo, who gonna handle his arrival? And who gonna stay strong when he shows up? 'Cause he's straight fire like when a refiner does his thing, or like when you bust out that premium soap:"
Malachi,3,3,"He's gonna be like a boss at refining and purifying silver. He'll make the sons of Levi all clean and shiny like gold and silver, so that they can make the Lord a righteous offering."
Malachi,3,4,"And the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will totally vibe with the LORD, like it was lit back in the olden days, you know, like way back when."
Malachi,3,5,"Yo, I'm gonna bring the heat and lay down some truth. I'll be like a flash, exposing those sorcerers, cheaters, liars, and anyone who mistreats hardworking folks, widows, orphans, and foreigners, all because they don't fear me, says the Almighty."
Malachi,3,6,"Because I'm the LORD and I don't change, that's why the sons of Jacob are still here, they haven't been wiped out or anything."
Malachi,3,7,"Hey, y'all have straight up been straying from my rules since the time of your parents. You haven't been keeping them, no cap. Come back to me, and I'll come back to you, says the LORD. But you've been like, 'How do we even come back?'"
Malachi,3,8,"Like, seriously dude, would someone even dare to steal from God? But guess what? You totally robbed Him, man! And you're sitting there like, 'Whoa, hold up! When did we rob You, God?' Well, let me tell you, it's in your total neglect of giving your tithes and offerings, bro."
Malachi,3,9,"Bro, you straight up cursed, man! You been stealing from me, like, the entire nation!"
Malachi,3,10,"Yo, make sure you bring all your tithes to the storehouse so there's enough food in my crib. And check this, the LORD of hosts challenges you to test Him on this – if He won't open up the heavens for you and shower you with so many blessings that you won't even have space to contain them. It's gonna be like heaven's faucets wide open, pouring out blessings non-stop!"
Malachi,3,11,"And I will totally shut down anyone or anything trying to wreck your blessings, so your crops won't get ruined and your vines won't drop their fruit too early, says the powerful LORD."
Malachi,3,12,"And everyone will think you're so blessed: because you'll be a super awesome place to live, says the LORD of all the cool stuff."
Malachi,3,13,"You've been talking tough against me, says the LORD. But you're like, 'What did we even say to offend you?'"
Malachi,3,14,"So, like, y'all be saying, 'What's the point of serving God?' and like, 'What do we gain from following His rules and acting all sad in front of the big man upstairs?'"
Malachi,3,15,"And now we're like, giving props to the arrogant and stuff, like those who do evil are getting all the attention; even those who dare to test God seem to come out on top. Like, they're straight up winning or something."
Malachi,3,16,"So, like, those who respected and honored the LORD, they, like, totally had a bunch of conversations with each other. And guess what? The LORD was, like, totally listening and paying attention! And get this, a super cool book of memories was, like, written right in front of Him for those who had mad respect for the LORD and, like, always remembered His name."
Malachi,3,17,"And they'll be mine, God says, when the time comes for me to gather up my prized possessions. I'll protect them and treat them with love, just like a caring father does with his dedicated son."
Malachi,3,18,"So, like, you're gonna come back and totally tell the difference between the people who do good stuff and those who are all, like, sketchy and wicked. You'll know who's all about serving God and who's not really into it."
Malachi,4,1,"Yo, listen up! There's a day coming that's gonna be hotter than an oven, and all the proud and wicked people are gonna go up in smoke like stubble. The LORD of hosts says that day is gonna burn 'em up so completely, there won't be a trace of 'em left!"
Malachi,4,2,"But for those of you who show respect for me, the Sun of righteousness will rise up, bringing healing in his wings; and you will go out, and flourish like stall-fed calves."
Malachi,4,3,"And you'll totally crush the wicked; they'll be like, totally reduced to ashes beneath your sneakers on the epic day when I make it happen, says the LORD of all the cool squads."
Malachi,4,4,"Yo, don't forget about the law of Moses, my OG servant. I straight up told him what's up on Mount Horeb for all of Israel, complete with all the rules and fairness."
Malachi,4,5,"Yo, listen up! Before the super intense and scary day when the LORD arrives, I'm gonna hook you up with Elijah the prophet, no cap!"
Malachi,4,6,"He will make parents and kids understand each other better, so the earth doesn't get messed up and bring trouble."
Matthew,1,1,"This is how the story starts: Jesus Christ, the homie who's descended from David and Abraham."
Matthew,1,2,"Abraham was the OG daddy to Isaac, who then became the ultimate dad to Jacob, and Jacob was the proud papa of Judas and his crew."
Matthew,1,3,"Judas had kids named Phares and Zara with Thamar. Then, Phares had a son named Esrom, and Esrom had a son named Aram."
Matthew,1,4,And Aram had a kid named Aminadab; and Aminadab had a kid named Naasson; and Naasson had a kid named Salmon;
Matthew,1,5,And Salmon had a child named Booz with Rachab; and Booz had a child named Obed with Ruth; and Obed had a child named Jesse;
Matthew,1,6,"So Jesse was like, the dad of King David, and King David was like, the dad of Solomon. Solomon's mom was actually Urias' wife, just so you know."
Matthew,1,7,"So, Solomon had a son named Roboam, who then had a dude called Abia, and Abia was the father of Asa."
Matthew,1,8,And Asa had a kid named Josaphat; and Josaphat had a kid named Joram; and Joram had a kid named Ozias;
Matthew,1,9,And Ozias had a kid named Joatham; and Joatham had a kid named Achaz; and Achaz had a kid named Ezekias;
Matthew,1,10,"Ezekias had a son named Manasses, who then had a son named Amon, and Amon became the father of Josias."
Matthew,1,11,"Josias became the dad of Jechonias and his bros right around the time they got taken to Babylon. (Some people say, Josias became the dad of Jakim, and Jakim became the dad of Jechonias.)"
Matthew,1,12,"And once they got taken to Babylon, Jechonias had a child named Salathiel; and Salathiel had a child named Zorobabel;"
Matthew,1,13,"And Zorobabel had a son named Abiud, who then had a son named Eliakim, who in turn had a son named Azor;"
Matthew,1,14,And Azor had a kid named Sadoc; then Sadoc had a kid named Achim; and Achim had a kid named Eliud;
Matthew,1,15,"And Eliud was like the OG, he had a son named Eleazar; Eleazar was all about that generational flow and he had a son named Matthan; Matthan was the real deal and he became a proud father to Jacob;"
Matthew,1,16,"So, like, Jacob was the dad of Joseph who was totally married to Mary, and they had a kid named Jesus, who everyone calls Christ."
Matthew,1,17,"So like, from Abraham to David, there were exactly fourteen generations. And from David until the whole Babylon exile thing, also fourteen generations. And then, from the exile until Christ, guess what? Yep, fourteen more generations!"
Matthew,1,18,"So, this is how it went down when Jesus Christ was born: Mary, Jesus' mom, was engaged to Joseph, but before they actually got together, she ended up preggers thanks to the Holy Ghost."
Matthew,1,19,"So, like, Joseph, her husband, he was a really righteous guy and didn't want to humiliate her publicly or anything, so he thought about just breaking up with her quietly."
Matthew,1,20,"Yo, so Joseph was deep in thought when the angel of the Lord popped up in his dream. The angel was like, Josephh, bro, don't stress. Go ahead and marry Mary, she's legit. The baby she's carrying is from the Holy Ghost, no doubt.'"
Matthew,1,21,"And she's gonna have a baby boy, and you gotta name him JESUS: 'cause he's gonna save his peeps from all their mess-ups. {JESUS: which means, Savior, in Hebrew}"
Matthew,1,22,"So basically, everything that went down was just to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet, like he predicted, you know?"
Matthew,1,23,"Yo, check it out! This cool virgin is gonna have a baby boy and they gonna name him Emmanuel, which means God is kickin' it with us. And by the way, people gonna be callin' him that."
Matthew,1,24,"So, like, Joseph woke up from his nap and was all like, 'Okay, I got this.' And he did what the angel of the Lord told him to do, and he married his wife and stuff."
Matthew,1,25,"And he didn't hook up with her until after she gave birth to her first kid, and he named him JESUS."
Matthew,2,1,"So, Jesus was like totally born in Bethlehem, you know, in Judaea during the time when Herod was the king. And guess what? There were these really wise dudes who came from the east all the way to Jerusalem, like wow!"
Matthew,2,2,"Yo, like, where's the dude who's supposed to be the King of the Jews? 'Cause we totally spotted his star in the east and rolled through here to pay our respects."
Matthew,2,3,"When Herod the king found out what was up, he got super stressed, and everyone in Jerusalem felt the same."
Matthew,2,4,"So, like, this dude gathered all the top religious peeps and asked them, 'Yo, where exactly is the birthplace of the Messiah gonna be?'"
Matthew,2,5,"And they were like, 'Dude, it's in Bethlehem of Judaea. The prophet totally wrote it down.'"
Matthew,2,6,"Yo, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, you may not be the most popular place among the bigshots, but don't sleep on it: a straight up boss is gonna come outta there, one who's gonna lead and take care of my people, Israel. (And by 'rule,' I mean 'feed,' y'know?)"
Matthew,2,7,"So Herod, like low-key secretly called the dudes who were wise, and was all like, 'Yo, when exactly did you see that epic star shining in the sky?'"
Matthew,2,8,"So he told them to head to Bethlehem and be all like, go on an intense search for the little kid. And once you find him, hit me up and let me know, so I can roll through and pay my respects to him too."
Matthew,2,9,"After listening to the king, they bounced; and whoa, the star they spotted in the east led them ahead until it reached and hovered right over the spot where the little kid was."
Matthew,2,10,"When they spotted the star, they were stoked and filled with hardcore happiness."
Matthew,2,11,"So when they went inside the house and saw the baby with his mom Mary, they were totally amazed and showed their respect by bowing down to worship him. Then, they opened their awesome presents and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Woah, what a gift!"
Matthew,2,12,"So, like, God totally warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. And guess what? They listened and took a different route back to their own country. Cool, right?"
Matthew,2,13,"So, after they left, dude, check it, the angel of the Lord shows up in Joseph's dream and goes like, 'Yo, get up, grab the baby and his mom, and run off to Egypt, and stay there until I give you the signal. 'Cause Herod is gonna try to search for the little one and harm him.'"
Matthew,2,14,"So, like, when he woke up, he totally grabbed the young child and his mom in the middle of the night and peaced out to Egypt:"
Matthew,2,15,"And stayed there until Herod died, so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet would come true: 'I have called my son out of Egypt.'"
Matthew,2,16,"And just like Jeremy, the prophet said, it all came true, he said,"
Matthew,2,17,"Bro, in Rama there was hella crying and mourning, like Rachel was sobbing for her kids and couldn't find no comfort, cuz they ain't here no more."
Matthew,2,18,"But like, right after Herod was like, dead and stuff, yo, this angel of the Lord popped up in Joe's dream while he was chillin' in Egypt,"
Matthew,2,19,"So, like, they were all, 'Dude, get up and grab the baby and his mom, and head over to Israel, you know? 'Cause those peeps who wanted to kill the baby are totally dead now."
Matthew,2,20,"So, he got up, grabbed the little kiddo and his mom, and headed back to Israel."
Matthew,2,21,"But when he found out that Archelaus was in charge in Judea instead of his dad, Herod, he got totally freaked out and didn't wanna go there. But then, God hit him up in a dream and told him to head over to Galilee instead. So that's what he did, you know?"
Matthew,2,22,"And he moved to this city called Nazareth, just like the prophets said he would, and that's why people started calling him a Nazarene."
Matthew,3,1,"Back in the day, John the Baptist showed up, dropping some serious teachings in the desert of Judaea,"
Matthew,3,2,"And like, yo, listen up! You gotta change your ways and stuff, 'cause the kingdom of heaven is like right around the corner, you know?"
Matthew,3,3,"Yo, this is the dude Isaiah was talking about: The voice of someone shouting in the middle of nowhere, telling ya to get ready for the Lord and make his paths straight."
Matthew,3,4,"Yo, this dude named John was rockin' a sick outfit made of camel's hair, topped off with a cool leather belt 'round his waist. And get this, his diet was straight-up locusts and wild honey—pretty unconventional, but hey, you do you, John!"
Matthew,3,5,"So, like, Jerusalem, all of Judaea, and even the whole area around Jordan went out to him, you know?"
Matthew,3,6,"And they got baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly admitting their mistakes."
Matthew,3,7,"But yo, when he peeped some of the Pharisees and Sadducees showin' up at his baptism, he straight up told 'em, 'Yo, y'all be some snakes, who told you to dip out and avoid the comin' heat?'"
Matthew,3,8,"So, like, make sure you show some legit good behavior to prove you're really sorry and changing for the better, ya know?"
Matthew,3,9,"And don't even think about boasting, saying to yourselves, 'We're genetically linked to Abraham, so we're all good.' Let me tell you, God can easily create new descendants of Abraham from literal rocks if He wanted to."
Matthew,3,10,"Yo, listen up! It's about to go down. Picture this: The axe is ready to chop at the roots of the trees. So, any tree that doesn't produce good fruit? It's getting cut down and tossed into the fire, no second chances."
Matthew,3,11,"I'm all about that water baptism for repentance, but the real deal is coming right up. This dude who's coming after me? Yeah, he's way more powerful than I am. I mean, I ain't even fit to carry his shoes, man. This guy is gonna hook you up with a baptism that's next level - we're talking about getting baptized with the Holy Ghost, and let me tell you, even with fire! It's gonna be lit!"
Matthew,3,12,"He's got a fan in his hand, and he's gonna clean up his place real good, sorting out the good stuff and throwing away the worthless stuff. The good stuff gets saved, but the worthless stuff? It's gonna get burned up, no escape."
Matthew,3,13,So Jesus rolls up from Galilee to the Jordan to meet up with John and get baptized by him.
Matthew,3,14,"But John was like, 'Nah bro, I should be the one getting baptized by you. Why you comin' to me?'"
Matthew,3,15,"Jesus replied, 'Just let it happen for now, bro. It's like, necessary for us to do the right thing and complete all righteousness. So, he allowed it.'"
Matthew,3,16,"And Jesus, after getting baptized, totally came out of the water like a boss. And, guess what, the sky opened up for him and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a chill dove, landing right on him with style:"
Matthew,3,17,"And yo, a voice straight from the heavens, like, totally said, 'This is my ultimate favorite Son, like, seriously, I'm super stoked about him and stuff.'"
Matthew,4,1,"So like, Jesus was totally taken by the Spirit and led into this desert place, right? And guess what? The devil thought he could tempt Jesus there too."
Matthew,4,2,"And like, after not eating anything for like forty days and forty nights, dude was totally starving."
Matthew,4,3,"And when this person who tried to distract him approached him, they said, like, 'If you're really God's child, do your thing and turn these rocks into bread.'"
Matthew,4,4,"But yo, he replied like, it's written, people can't survive off bread only, ya know? We need every word that comes from God's mouth to really thrive."
Matthew,4,5,"Next, the devil vibes with him and whisks him away to the lit city, putting him on the highest point of the temple."
Matthew,4,6,"And he's like, yo, if you're really God's Son, why don't you jump off this thing? 'Cause it says in the book, the angels got your back and they'll catch you, so you won't even stub your toe, bro."
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus was like, 'Bro, it's already written down, don't even think about testing the Lord, He's the real deal. #NoTemptingAllowed"
Matthew,4,8,"Once again, the devil brings him up to a super high mountain and flexes, showing him all the lit kingdoms of the world and their fantastic glory!"
Matthew,4,9,"And he's like, yo, I'll hook you up with all this stuff if you just bow down and worship me."
Matthew,4,10,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, Satan, peace out! The scriptures say you should only worship and serve the Lord your God, no one else!'"
Matthew,4,11,"And then Satan left him, and boom, angels showed up and started taking care of him."
Matthew,4,12,"So like, when Jesus found out that John got thrown into prison, he was like peacee out' and went to Galilee, you know?"
Matthew,4,13,"So Jesus bounced from Nazareth and set up shop in Capernaum, a lit coastal town in the outskirts of Zabulon and Nephthalim."
Matthew,4,14,"So that what Esaias the prophet said would come true, he said,"
Matthew,4,15,"The places called Zabulon and Nephthalim, along with the cool coastal vibe, beyond the Jordan River, Galilee where people from different backgrounds hang out;"
Matthew,4,16,The peeps chillin' in darkness totally saw this epic bright light; and those stuck in the place of death's gloomy vibe got blessed with some lit illumination.
Matthew,4,17,"Bruh, Jesus started preaching and he was straight up like, 'Yo, y'all need to repent ASAP, 'cause the kingdom of heaven is right around the corner.'"
Matthew,4,18,"Jesus was strolling by the sea of Galilee and spotted two dudes, Simon aka Peter, and Andrew, his bro, throwing a net into the sea. These guys were all about that fishing life."
Matthew,4,19,"And he's like, 'Yo, come with me, and I'll teach you how to catch people.'"
Matthew,4,20,"And like, they totally ditched their nets right away and started following him, no hesitation, no second thoughts."
Matthew,4,21,"And as he moved on, he spotted two other dudes, James sonn of Zebedee) and John, chilling in a boat with Zebedee, their old man, fixing their nets. Then he was like, 'Yo, come hang with me!'"
Matthew,4,22,"And they dipped out of the ship real quick, leaving their dad behind and bounced to follow him."
Matthew,4,23,"So Jesus was like, going all around Galilee, dropping some knowledge in their synagogues, preaching about the kingdom and straight up healing all sorts of sickness and diseases among the people."
Matthew,4,24,"And word got out all over Syria about how awesome he was, so they brought him all the sick peeps with different kinds of illnesses and suffering, including those who were possessed by demons, those who were acting all crazy, and those who couldn't move because of some condition. And guess what? He totally healed them all!"
Matthew,4,25,"So like, a bunch of people from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judaea, and even from beyond the Jordan, all started following him, ya know?"
Matthew,5,1,"So, like, Jesus looked out and saw a bunch of people, and he was like, 'Okay, time to get my zen on.' So he went up this mountain and sat down, and his crew of disciples was like, 'Hey Jesus, what's up?'"
Matthew,5,2,"So, like, he started talking and dropped some knowledge, saying,"
Matthew,5,3,"Those who have a humble mindset are blessed, 'cause they got the hookup to heaven's kingdom."
Matthew,5,4,"Those who feel down vibes will be uplifted, yo: they'll find some genuine comfort in the game of life."
Matthew,5,5,"Happy are the chill ones, 'cause they'll totally score the whole planet."
Matthew,5,6,"Happy are those who crave justice and righteousness, because they will find fulfillment."
Matthew,5,7,"Those who show kindness are totally blessed, 'coz they'll definitely receive kindness back."
Matthew,5,8,"So like, those who are genuine and have like, no hidden agenda or bad vibes in their hearts, they're totally #blessed 'cause they'll get to experience the awesomeness of encountering God and stuff."
Matthew,5,9,"Those who bring peace are so epic, bro, 'cause they'll totally be known as God's squad. 🙌"
Matthew,5,10,"Hella fortunate are the ones who get persecuted for doing what's right, 'cause they're the kings and queens of heaven."
Matthew,5,11,"You're lucky when people trash talk you, harass you, and spread all sorts of lies about you just because you believe in me. Like, they're totally making things up, you know? But hey, keep your head up! It's all because of me."
Matthew,5,12,"Yo, listen up! Be stoked and totally hype, 'cause your reward in heaven is gonna be lit AF! Just think about it, the prophets before you got mad persecuted. You're in good company, fam!"
Matthew,5,13,"You all are like the seasoning that makes the earth taste better: but if the seasoning loses its flavor, how can it be seasoned again? It's worthless then, just thrown away and stepped on by everyone."
Matthew,5,14,You all are like the coolest influencers ever. A lit city on a sick hill that's impossible to miss.
Matthew,5,15,"Yo, you don't light a candle and then hide it under a boring old container. Nah, you put it on a dope candle holder where it can shine bright and illuminate the whole house. By the way, in the original language, that 'container' word means a measurement that's slightly smaller than a peck."
Matthew,5,16,"Yo, like, shine your light so everyone can see your dope deeds and give props to your Dad up in heaven."
Matthew,5,17,"Don't even think that I'm here to wreck the rules or the words of the spiritual leaders. Nah, I'm not here to ruin anything - I'm here to make it all complete and meaningful."
Matthew,5,18,"Honestly, listen up peeps, heaven and earth won't go outta style before every little rule in the law gets totally crossed off the list. It's gotta be completed, no doubts about it."
Matthew,5,19,"So like, anyone who breaks even the tiniest commandment and spreads the idea that it's cool, they'll be considered the lowest in the heavenly kingdom. But those who actually follow the commandments and spread the good word, they'll be seen as super awesome in the heavenly kingdom."
Matthew,5,20,"Listen up, fam. If you wanna get into the kingdom of heaven, your righteousness gotta be on a different level than them scribes and Pharisees. No cap, it's gotta be on point."
Matthew,5,21,"You know how it goes, back in the day they used to say, 'Don't take someone's life, and if you do, you better watch out for the consequences!"
Matthew,5,22,"But listen up, fam. Anybody who gets mad at their bro for no legit reason is asking for some serious judgment, ya feel? And anyone who straight up disses their bro, calling them a nobody, better watch out for the council. But here's the real deal: if you call your bro a fool, you're seriously tempting the fires of hell. Oh, and just so you know, 'Raca' basically means 'useless loser'."
Matthew,5,23,"So, like, if you're gonna give your gift at the altar and then you suddenly remember that your bro isn't cool with you, ya know..."
Matthew,5,24,"Yo, before you go all spiritual and stuff, leave your gift in front of the altar, dip out for a sec, and make things right with your brother first. Then you can come back and offer your gift like it's all good."
Matthew,5,25,"Yo, like, if you got beef with someone, try to squash it ASAP while you're still chillin' together. 'Cause if you let it drag on, next thing you know, that person might snitch on you to the authorities, then the authorities pass you on to some enforcer, and before you know it, you're locked up."
Matthew,5,26,"Listen up, I'm telling you straight up, there's no way you're getting out of there until you've paid every last penny you owe."
Matthew,5,27,"Okay listen up, you've probably heard the old folks saying something like 'Don't cheat on your partner:'"
Matthew,5,28,"But listen up, y'all. If you're checkin' out a girl just to get all thirsty for her, you've already broken the commitment in your heart and technically cheated on her."
Matthew,5,29,"And if something you see online upsets you, block it, and remove it from your feed: because it's better for you to lose one follower, than for your entire online presence to be tainted. #SelfCare"
Matthew,5,30,"And if your right hand is causing problems for you, just get rid of it and throw it away. It's better for you to lose one of your body parts than for your whole body to end up in hell."
Matthew,5,31,"So, like, people used to say that if you wanted to ditch your wife, you had to give her, like, a legal paper to make it official and stuff:"
Matthew,5,32,"But listen up, y'all. If anyone breaks up with their spouse, except for cheating, they're basically making their ex commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced person is also commiting adultery."
Matthew,5,33,"Yo, you probably heard the old folks talking about this, but they said you shouldn't break your promises and instead keep them for the big man upstairs. Like, you gotta stay true to your word and honor your commitments, dude."
Matthew,5,34,"Yo guys, listen up. Don't be using swear words, like, at all. And I'm talking about not even swearing by heaven, 'cause that's where God's chillin' on His throne, ya know?"
Matthew,5,35,"And not even the earth, 'cause that's just where he rests his feet. And not even Jerusalem, 'cause that's like the city of the ultimate boss."
Matthew,5,36,"Don't go like, promising on your own head and stuff, 'cause let's be real, you can't even control the color of a single strand of hair."
Matthew,5,37,"Here's the deal: just be straightforward and honest with your words, none of that extra fluff. Anything more than that is just plain wrong."
Matthew,5,38,"So basically, you've probably heard people say 'Do unto others as they do unto you', eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth kind of deal:"
Matthew,5,39,"Yo, listen up! Check it - I got a real talk for ya. Don't let evil get to ya, keep your chill. If someone decides to throw shade at you and hits you on the right cheek, don't hit 'em back. Instead, show 'em your other cheek. Yeah, it's all about taking the high road, no need for revenge or negativity."
Matthew,5,40,"If someone wants to take you to court and take your clothes, let them take your jacket too."
Matthew,5,41,"If someone asks you to go the extra mile, go even further with them."
Matthew,5,42,"If someone asks you for something, be willing to give it to them. Don't refuse to lend things to those who need them."
Matthew,5,43,"So, like, you know how people have always been saying Lovee your neighbor and hate your enemy', right?"
Matthew,5,44,"But listen, fam, here's the deal: show mad love to your haters, speak blessings over those who curse you, do good for the ones who straight up hate you, and pray for those who treat you like trash or straight up go against you;"
Matthew,5,45,"So you can be like your heavenly Dad, because he makes the sun shine on both the wicked and the righteous, and sends rain to both the fair and the unfair."
Matthew,5,46,"If you only show love to those who love you back, what's the point? Even tax collectors do that, fam."
Matthew,5,47,"And if you only say hi to your squad, what's the flex? Even the basic ones do that, yo."
Matthew,5,48,"So, like, strive to be totally flawless and perfect, just like how your heavenly Father is flawless and perfect. No pressure or anything!"
Matthew,6,1,"Yo, listen up, don't be flexin' your good deeds in front of everyone just to impress them. If you do that, you won't get any props from your heavenly Father. Keep it low-key, fam."
Matthew,6,2,"So, like, when you do good things for others, don't go around making a big show of it, trying to get attention and praise from everyone. Seriously, those hypocrites who do that in church or out on the streets, they're just doing it for their own image. Trust me, they already got what they wanted - their moment in the spotlight. Don't be like them."
Matthew,6,3,"But when you help others, don't brag about it or seek attention for it:"
Matthew,6,4,"So, like, when you do something good, keep it on the down low. Don't go broadcasting it to the world, ya know? 'Cause here's the deal: when you do these things in secret, your heavenly Dad, who sees everything, he'll totally hook you up and give you a big shoutout for everyone to see!"
Matthew,6,5,"And when you pray, don't be like those hypocrites who love showing off their prayers in synagogues and on street corners just to impress people. I'm telling you, they've already gotten all the recognition they wanted."
Matthew,6,6,"But, like, when you wanna pray, just go chill in your room, close the door, and talk to your Heavenly Father in private. And let me tell you, He sees everything that goes down in secret and He's totally gonna bless you out in the open for it."
Matthew,6,7,"When you pray, don't keep repeating empty words like the non-believers do, thinking that talking a lot will get you heard."
Matthew,6,8,"So, like, don't even try to be like those people, 'cause your Dad totally knows what you need even before you ask Him, you know?"
Matthew,6,9,"So, like, when you pray, it's all like: Hey, Heavenly Dad, Your name is totally sacred and stuff, you know?"
Matthew,6,10,"May your kingdom come and your will be done here on earth, just like it is in heaven."
Matthew,6,11,"Hook us up with some fresh grub, every single day."
Matthew,6,12,"And like, forgive us for the money we owe, just as we forgive those who owe us money."
Matthew,6,13,"Don't let us get tempted, but keep us safe from bad vibes. 'Cause you're the boss, forever and ever. Amen."
Matthew,6,14,"If you show mercy and forgive others when they mess up, big man upstairs will do the same for you:"
Matthew,6,15,"But like, if you can't forgive other peeps for their mistakes, then don't expect your Dad to forgive you for yours. #forgivenessiskey"
Matthew,6,16,"When you fast, don't be like those fake people who act all sad and stuff just to impress others. Seriously, I'm telling you, they're only doing it for attention and that's their only reward."
Matthew,6,17,"But like, when you're fasting, just take care of yourself and look fresh, ya know? Make sure to wash your face and put some oil on your head."
Matthew,6,18,"So, like, don't show off when you fast, you know? Just do it for your Dad up in heaven. He knows what's up, even when no one else does. And trust me, He's gonna hook you up big time."
Matthew,6,19,"Don't stack up your riches here on earth, bro, 'cause all that fancy stuff ends up getting messed up by moths and rust, and sneaky thieves can just swoop in and swipe it all:"
Matthew,6,20,"Store up your clout in heaven, where no dank meme or outdated trend can corrupt it, and where no haters can swoop in and steal it:"
Matthew,6,21,"The stuff you value the most is where your heart's gonna be, fam."
Matthew,6,22,"Your eye is like the ultimate source of vibes and energy for your whole self. So, if your eye is focused on one thing, your entire being will radiate with positivity and brightness."
Matthew,6,23,"But, like, if your eye is like all messed up and stuff, your whole body is gonna be, like, filled with darkness. So, if the light inside you is actually darkness, then man, that darkness is, like, super intense!"
Matthew,6,24,"You can't be loyal to two people in charge at the same time: because you're either gonna dislike one and favor the other, or you'll stick with one and look down upon the other. It's impossible to be dedicated to God and worldly wealth at the same time."
Matthew,6,25,"So, like, listen up! I'm telling you, don't stress about your life, like worrying about what you're gonna eat or drink, or what outfit to wear. Life is about so much more than just food and clothes, you know?"
Matthew,6,26,"Check out the birds in the sky: they don't plant or harvest or put food away in storage, but your heavenly Dad takes care of them. Aren't you way more important than they are?"
Matthew,6,27,"Like, seriously, who here, like, by overthinking can, like, make themselves even an inch taller?"
Matthew,6,28,"Yo, why you stressin' about clothes? Look at those lilies in the field, they just chill and grow, not a care in the world."
Matthew,6,29,"But, like, seriously ya'll, let me tell you this: Even freakin' Solomon, with all his riches and swag, couldn't compare to how sick these things look, man."
Matthew,6,30,"Yo, like, if God takes care of the grass that's here one day and gone the next, then he'll definitely take care of you too, fam. Don't stress out, y'all just need a little more trust!"
Matthew,6,31,"So, like, don't stress out about, like, what we're gonna eat, or, like, what we're gonna drink, or, like, what we're gonna wear, okay?"
Matthew,6,32,"(Because, like, all these stuff that people who aren't like, part of the fam, want and chase after, ya know?) But don't trip, 'cause your heavenly Father totally gets that you need all these things, no cap."
Matthew,6,33,"Yo, like, priorities, fam. Make seeking God's kingdom and doing what's right your main focus, and trust me, all the blessings will come your way. No cap."
Matthew,6,34,"So don't stress about tomorrow, 'cause it'll handle its own stuff. Each day has enough of its own challenges to deal with, ya know?"
Matthew,7,1,"Don't judge, so no one will judge you."
Matthew,7,2,"The way you judge others will come back to judge you, and the way you treat others will be the same way you're treated."
Matthew,7,3,Why are you so focused on your bro's small issue when you totally ignore the gigantic problem you've got going on?
Matthew,7,4,"Or how are you gonna be like, 'Yo bro, let me remove that tiny speck from your eye,' when you got a massive plank in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,"Yo, look, before you start pointing fingers at others, check yourself first and fix your own flaws. Once you've done that, then you can help your bro with their smaller issues, no cap."
Matthew,7,6,"Don't waste your holy stuff on people who don't value it, or share your precious gems with those who won't appreciate them. They'll just stomp on them and come back to hurt you."
Matthew,7,7,"Yo, just put it out there and you'll get it, go on a mission and you'll stumble upon it, give a little tap and doors will swing wide open for you:"
Matthew,7,8,"Like, whoever asks for something, they totally receive it, and whoever seeks, they'll like find it, and if you knock, the door will be totally opened for you."
Matthew,7,9,"Like, seriously, would any of y'all as a parent give your kid a rock if they asked for bread?"
Matthew,7,10,"Like, if he's all like, 'Yo, can I get some sushi?' Is he gonna slide him a freaking snake or what?"
Matthew,7,11,"So like, if you, as a flawed human being, can totally hook up your kids with awesome presents, imagine how much better and more amazing your Heavenly Father can hook you up with good stuff when you ask Him?"
Matthew,7,12,"So basically, treat others the way you wanna be treated. It's like the golden rule of vibes. This is the whole deal according to the OG law and prophets, ya feel me?"
Matthew,7,13,"Yo, like, make sure you enter through the narrow gate, 'cause the one that's wide AF is the road to destruction, and TBH, so many people choose to go down that path, you feel me? #JustSaying #ChooseWisely"
Matthew,7,14,"The gate's super tight and the road's hella narrow that leads to life, and only a few peeps actually find it. For real though."
Matthew,7,15,"Yo, be on high alert for them fake prophets, you know? They be out here rockin' sheep's clothing, but on the inside, they straight up hungry wolves."
Matthew,7,16,"You can judge people by what they bring to the table. Like, you wouldn't expect to find grapes among thorns or figs among thistles, right?"
Matthew,7,17,"Like, seriously, every awesome tree produces awesome fruits, but a messed up tree produces totally trash fruits."
Matthew,7,18,"A lit tree can't produce sketchy vibes, and, like, a shady tree can't produce dope vibes."
Matthew,7,19,"If a tree doesn't produce good fruit, it gets cut down and thrown into the fire."
Matthew,7,20,"So basically, you can totally tell what someone's about by seeing the results they bring. No cap."
Matthew,7,21,"It's not about just saying 'Yo, Lord, Lord' to me - that won't get you into heaven. You gotta actually do what my Father up in heaven wants."
Matthew,7,22,"Yo, on that day, there gonna be a bunch of people saying to me, 'Yo, Lord, Lord, didn't we spit straight facts in your name? And didn't we flex our skills and cast out those evil vibes in your name? And didn't we straight up do some mind-blowing stuff in your name?'"
Matthew,7,23,"And I'll be like, 'Yo, I don't even know you guys, so bounce! You're all doing shady stuff.'"
Matthew,7,24,"So, like, anyone who actually listens to what I'm saying and actually puts it into action, I'll compare them to a really smart person who built their house on, like, solid ground or something:"
Matthew,7,25,"And then, like, a major downpour happened, and there were like, crazy floods and super strong winds that were just pounding on this house, but miraculously, it didn't collapse because it was built on a solid foundation, man."
Matthew,7,26,"And anyone who hears what I'm saying but doesn't put it into action will be like a total clown, who decided to construct their crib on a sandy foundation:"
Matthew,7,27,"Then the rain started pouring, and the floods rolled in, and the winds were blowing like crazy, and it all crashed down on that house. And let me tell you, it fell hard, and it fell big time."
Matthew,7,28,"And like, after Jesus finished saying these things, the people were totally shook by his teachings:"
Matthew,7,29,"He was, like, totally legit, teaching with mad authority, not like those scribes trying way too hard."
Matthew,8,1,"After he came down from the mountain, a ton of people started following him. Like, it was a whole crowd, you know?"
Matthew,8,2,"Yo, check it out, there was this dude with leprosy who came up to Jesus and showed him mad respect, like Lordd, if you want to, you have the power to heal me and make me clean.'"
Matthew,8,3,"Then Jesus reached out and touched him, saying, 'I gotchu, bro. Be free from this illness.' And BOOM! Right away, his leprosy vanished."
Matthew,8,4,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Don't spill the beans to anyone, but bounce and go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses said, all as a way to give 'em solid evidence.'"
Matthew,8,5,"So, Jesus rolls into Capernaum, right? And then, out of nowhere, this centurion dude shows up begging him for something."
Matthew,8,6,"And like, I was like, 'Yo Lord, my servant is like, stuck at home with this totally awful sickness called palsy, and it's like, seriously messing him up big time.'"
Matthew,8,7,"And Jesus is like, 'Bro, don't worry, I got you. I'll slide through and fix you up real good.'"
Matthew,8,8,"Yo, Lord, I ain't even worthy for you to come to my place, but just say the word and my homie will be healed."
Matthew,8,9,"I'm like a boss, dude. I got my squad in check. I tell one guy, 'Go!' and he's outta here. Then, I call another one, 'Come!' and he's in. And when I tell my servant, 'Do this,' he gets it done, no questions asked."
Matthew,8,10,"When Jesus heard that, he was super impressed and told his squad, 'Seriously, guys, I haven't come across such an amazing amount of faith, like, not even among the peeps in Israel.'"
Matthew,8,11,"Listen up, fam! I wanna tell you something dope. There's gonna be mad peeps rollin' up from every direction, east and west, and they're gonna chillax with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Can I get an amen?!"
Matthew,8,12,But those who were supposed to belong to the kingdom will be thrown into a super dark place where there will be tons of crying and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,8,13,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, centurion, do your thing and as you trusted, let it happen to you.' Boom, his servant was healed right then and there."
Matthew,8,14,"When Jesus went to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, totally sick with a fever."
Matthew,8,15,"Then he like, touched her hand, and the fever was totally gone, and she got up and started helping them out."
Matthew,8,16,"When nightfall came, a bunch of people brought their friends who were totally possessed by evil spirits to Jesus. And guess what? He totally kicked those spirits out just by speaking, and on top of that, he healed everyone who was sick!"
Matthew,8,17,"So like, this totally happened to fulfill what Isaiah the prophet said, like, he said that himself, you know, Jesus, he took on all of our weaknesses and carried our sicknesses, like, that's how it went down, you know?"
Matthew,8,18,"So, like, Jesus peeped the huge crowds around him and was all like, 'Guys, let's bounce to the other side.'"
Matthew,8,19,"So there's this guy, a scribe, who came up to Jesus and was like, 'Yo, Master, I'm totally down to follow you wherever you go.'"
Matthew,8,20,"And Jesus was like, yo bro, foxes got their hideouts, and the birds up in the sky got their chill nests to crash in, but this Son of man doesn't even have a decent spot to rest his head, man. Some tough times, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Matthew,8,21,"Then one of his followers said to him, 'Yo, Lord, lemme handle this first and go bury my pops.'"
Matthew,8,22,"But Jesus was like, 'Yo, come chill with me and let the ones who ain't really living take care of the ones already in the ground.'"
Matthew,8,23,"And when he hopped on a boat, his squad rolled with him."
Matthew,8,24,"Yo, check it out, this crazy storm came up on the sea and it was so intense that the ship got totally swamped by the waves. But get this, the dude was knocked out asleep."
Matthew,8,25,"His squad pulled up on him, shook him up, and were like, 'Hey, Lord, we're screwed! Save us! We're about to die.'"
Matthew,8,26,"And he's like, 'Yo, why y'all so scared, you doubters?' Then he gets up and straight up tells the wind and the sea to chill, and everything becomes super peaceful."
Matthew,8,27,"Yo, like, the guys were freaking out and they were all like, 'Dude, who is this guy? He's literally controlling the wind and the sea! Mind blown!'"
Matthew,8,28,"So, like, Jesus crossed over to the other side into this place called Gergesenes, and suddenly these two people, totally possessed by demons, came rushing out from the graves. And let me tell you, they were crazy intense, like nobody could even go near that spot."
Matthew,8,29,"Yo, check it out, they were like shouting, 'What's up with you, Jesus, the Son of God? Did you come here to mess us up before our time?'"
Matthew,8,30,"And there's, like, this big group of pigs chilling far away from them, just doing their pig thing, you know."
Matthew,8,31,"So, like, the demons were all begging him, like, 'If you're gonna kick us out, at least let us, like, go chill with the pigs, you know?'"
Matthew,8,32,"And he was like, 'Yo, just go.' So they dipped and rolled up to this group of swine, right? And yo, check this out, the whole crew of swine straight up went bonkers and ran down this super steep spot into the sea, and yeah, they didn't make it out alive. Sad vibes."
Matthew,8,33,"So, like, the people who were taking care of them ran away, and like, they went into the city and like spread the word about everything that went down with those who were possessed by demons."
Matthew,8,34,"So, like, everyone in the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they were all like, 'Dude, please leave our area.'"
Matthew,9,1,"So, he hopped on a boat, sailed to the other side, and arrived in his hometown."
Matthew,9,2,"So, like, these people brought a guy who was like super sick and couldn't move, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw how strong their belief was, he was like, 'Dude, don't worry, cheer up! Your mistakes are totally forgiven!'"
Matthew,9,3,"So, like, some of those scribes were all like, 'OMG, this guy is totally disrespecting, you know? Like, he's saying some really bad stuff.'"
Matthew,9,4,"And Jesus, like, totally knew what they were thinking, and he's like, 'Why are you guys thinking such negative stuff in your hearts?'"
Matthew,9,5,"Like, seriously, which is easier? Saying 'Dude, your sins are forgiven' or saying 'Yo, get up and start walking'?"
Matthew,9,6,"Just so you know, the Son of Man has the power to forgive sins here on earth. And then he said to the person who couldn't move because of a sickness, 'Get up, pick up your bedding, and head back to your home.'"
Matthew,9,7,"And he bounced, and headed home."
Matthew,9,8,"But when the crowds saw it, they were shook and praised God, who gave such mad power to humans."
Matthew,9,9,"So like, Jesus was walking and he spotted this dude called Matthew sitting at his job as a tax collector. And Jesus goes up to him and be like 'Yo, come with me.' And you know what? Matthew actually gets up and starts following him, just like that."
Matthew,9,10,"So, Jesus was chillin' at a food joint, and guess what? A bunch of tax collectors and sinners came and joined him and his crew for a meal."
Matthew,9,11,"And when the Pharisees peeped that, they were like yo, disciples, why is your Master grubbin' with tax collectors and sinners?"
Matthew,9,12,"But yo, when Jesus heard that, he straight up said to them, 'Those who are all good don't need a doctor, it's only those who are sick that need one.'"
Matthew,9,13,"But like, seriously, go and educate yourselves on what this actually means, okay? It's all about showing kindness and compassion rather than just focusing on religious rituals and sacrifices. Just so you know, I didn't come here to hang out with the perfect and blameless people, but to help those who have messed up to turn their lives around."
Matthew,9,14,"So, like, the followers of John approached Jesus, and they were all like, 'Yo, why is it that we and the Pharisees are always fasting, but your crew never fasts?'"
Matthew,9,15,"Yo, Jesus was like, can the homies at the wedding party be sad while the groom is still there? Nah, but like, there will be a time when the groom is gone, and that's when they gonna fast."
Matthew,9,16,"Nobody tries to patch up an old piece of clothing with a fresh new cloth, because the patch will ruin the fabric even more. Trust, it's not a good move, my friend."
Matthew,9,17,"You wouldn't pour new juice into old containers, 'cause they'll burst and the juice will spill, and the containers will go kaput. Instead, pour new juice into new containers, and both will stay fresh. {containers: or skins, or leather}"
Matthew,9,18,"So, like, while Jesus was talking to them, this important guy shows up and bows down to him, like, saying, 'Yo, my daughter just died, but if you touch her, she'll totally come back to life.'"
Matthew,9,19,"Then Jesus got up and started following him, and his squad of disciples did the same."
Matthew,9,20,"Yo, listen up! So, there was this woman who had been dealing with this blood issue for, like, twelve whole years, right? And what does she do? She sneaks up from behind Jesus and just touches the edge of his outfit, man!"
Matthew,9,21,"Because she thought to herself, 'If I just touch his clothes, I'll be totally healed.'"
Matthew,9,22,"But then Jesus turned around and when he glanced at her, he said, 'Hey, girl, chill out! Your belief in me is what made you all better.' And just like that, the woman got healed instantly."
Matthew,9,23,"And when Jesus rolled up to the ruler's crib, and peeped the crowd wildin' out with the musicians and all that,"
Matthew,9,24,"He was like, 'Yo, move aside 'cause the girl ain't actually dead, she's just taking a nap.' And they all straight up laughed at him, like mocking and all."
Matthew,9,25,"But once everyone left the room, he walked in, held her hand, and the girl got up."
Matthew,9,26,And everyone in the whole land was all like totally talking about it. #ICONIC
Matthew,9,27,"So, Jesus was leaving that place, right? And then, these two blind dudes started following him, straight up crying out like, 'Hey, Son of David, please have mercy on us!'"
Matthew,9,28,"So, when Jesus entered the house, the blind dudes approached him. Jesus asked them, 'Do you trust that I have the power to make this happen?' And they replied, 'Totally, dude! You're the boss!'"
Matthew,9,29,"He like, booped their eyes and was like, yo, whatever you believe is what's gonna happen."
Matthew,9,30,"And like, their eyes were legit opened, and Jesus was super serious when he told them, like, make sure no one finds out about this, ya know?"
Matthew,9,31,"But dude, once they left, they totally went and spread the word about him all over that whole area."
Matthew,9,32,"Yo, as they were leaving, check it out, they brought this dude to him who couldn't speak, but was straight up possessed by a demon."
Matthew,9,33,"And like, when the devil got yeeted out, the mute started speaking: and everyone was shooketh, like saying, bruh, we've never seen anything like this in Israel before."
Matthew,9,34,"But like, the Pharisees were like, 'He's, like, exorcising demons using the leader of the demons, dude.'"
Matthew,9,35,"So Jesus was going around to all the cities and villages, teaching at their synagogues, and spreading the good news of the kingdom, while also healing all kinds of sicknesses and diseases among the people."
Matthew,9,36,"But when he peeped all the people, he felt mad compassion for them because they were straight up exhausted and lost, like sheep without a leader. {exhausted...: or, were tired and just straight up chilling}"
Matthew,9,37,"Yo, he's like, 'Listen up, fam. The harvest game is strong, no cap, but we're seriously low on squad members putting in the work.'"
Matthew,9,38,"So, like, make sure you hit up God and ask Him to send some homies to help out with His work, you know, spreading the good vibes and stuff."
Matthew,10,1,"And, like, Jesus had his twelve squad members with him, and he hooked them up with some insane superpowers to destroy all those evil spirits, heal all sorts of sicknesses, and cure all kinds of diseases. It was, like, lit fam!"
Matthew,10,2,"So, here are the names of the twelve apostles: First, there's Simon, aka Peter, and his bro Andrew; then, there's James, Zebedee's son, and his bro John."
Matthew,10,3,"Yo, we got Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James aka Alphaeus' son, and Lebbaeus, who was also known as Thaddaeus."
Matthew,10,4,"Simon, the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who totally backstabbed him."
Matthew,10,5,"So Jesus sent out these twelve and told them, 'Hey, don't head towards any Gentile territories, and don't bother entering any Samaritan towns:'"
Matthew,10,6,"But instead, like, go find the lost squad from the house of Israel, you know?"
Matthew,10,7,"Yo, as you go, spread the word, like, saying, The kingdom of heaven is legit right there."
Matthew,10,8,"Help out those who are sick, get rid of any diseases, bring life back to those who are dead, and kick out the evil spirits: all the good stuff you've been blessed with, pass it on without expecting anything in return."
Matthew,10,9,"Don't bother with any cash, whether it's gold, silver, or even bronze in your wallets,"
Matthew,10,10,"Don't stress about packing a bag for your trip, you don't need two sets of clothes or extra shoes or even a walking stick. Just remember, the one doing the work deserves to be taken care of."
Matthew,10,11,"When you go to a new place, check out who's cool and chill there, and stay with them until you're ready to leave."
Matthew,10,12,"And when you enter a house, say hi to it."
Matthew,10,13,"And if the crib is legit, spread your good vibes on it: but if it's not legit, take your peace back, dude."
Matthew,10,14,"If anyone doesn't welcome you or listen to what you have to say, simply shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that place."
Matthew,10,15,"For real, I'm telling you, it's gonna be way easier for Sodom and Gomorrha on judgment day than for that town."
Matthew,10,16,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna send you out like sheep surrounded by wolves. So, you gotta be smart like snakes, but stay cool like doves. 🔥"
Matthew,10,17,"Just a heads up, peeps: be wary of others, 'cause some might hand you over to the authorities and give you a beat down in their hangouts."
Matthew,10,18,"And you'll totally have to appear before governors and kings because of me, like, to show them and the non-believers what's up."
Matthew,10,19,"But when they hand you over, don't stress about what to say or how to say it: because in that very moment, you'll be given exactly what to say."
Matthew,10,20,"Dude, when you're talking, it's not really you speaking - it's the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Like, that divine power is channeling its words through you, bro."
Matthew,10,21,"And one sibling will betray another, and even parents will turn against their own kids, leading to their tragic demise."
Matthew,10,22,"And people gonna straight up hate on you just because of my name, but if you keep pushing through till the very end, you gonna be saved, fam."
Matthew,10,23,"But if they start giving you a hard time in this town, peace out and go find another one, 'cause let me tell you something, you won't even hit up all the cities in Israel before the Son of Man shows up."
Matthew,10,24,"Bruh, like the student shouldn't think he's better than his teacher, and the employee shouldn't act all high and mighty compared to their boss."
Matthew,10,25,"A disciple just gotta be like their master, and a servant gotta be like their lord. If people call the master of the house Beelzebub, they gonna call the people in his crew even worse, yo!"
Matthew,10,26,"So, like, don't be scared of them, okay? 'Cause, seriously, nothing stays hidden forever. Eventually, everything that's been covered up will come to light, and anything that's been hidden will be exposed for all to see. Just keep that in mind, fam."
Matthew,10,27,"Spread the word about what I tell you privately, openly and boldly; and announce what you hear privately, make it known to all."
Matthew,10,28,"Don't stress about those who can only end your physical life, but can't touch your soul. Instead, show respect to the one who has the power to wipe out both body and soul in the depths of hell."
Matthew,10,29,"Yo, have you ever noticed that two sparrows are sold for practically nothing? And even when one of those lil' birds falls to the ground, you bet God's always got His eye on it. (Just so you know, a 'farthing' back in the day was like a super tiny coin, worth way less than a penny)."
Matthew,10,30,"But, like, even the tiniest hairs on your head are all counted, no cap."
Matthew,10,31,"Don't stress, fam! You're worth way more than a bunch of sparrows."
Matthew,10,32,"So, like, if anyone speaks up for me in front of others, I'll totally speak up for them in front of my Dad up in heaven."
Matthew,10,33,"But if anyone disses me in front of others, I'll diss them in front of my Father up in the skies."
Matthew,10,34,"Don't think that I've come to bring peace to the world, because I didn't come to bring peace - I came to bring some serious vibes."
Matthew,10,35,"Yo, I'm here to bring some serious tension between a dude and his pops, a daughter and her mom, and a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law."
Matthew,10,36,And a person's enemies will even come from their own fam squad.
Matthew,10,37,"If someone loves their parents more than they love me, they're not really down with me. And if someone loves their kids more than they love me, they're not really down with me either."
Matthew,10,38,"And if you're not ready to carry your own struggles and walk the same path as me, then you're not showing that you truly value our connection."
Matthew,10,39,"If you're constantly searching for your own happiness, you'll end up losing it. But if you're willing to let go of your ego and prioritize my purpose, you'll find true fulfillment in the end."
Matthew,10,40,"If someone vibes with you, they vibe with me, and if they vibe with me, they vibe with the one who sent me."
Matthew,10,41,"If you welcome a prophet because they're a prophet, you'll get the same blessings as a prophet. And if you welcome a righteous person for their righteousness, you'll receive the same blessings as a righteous person."
Matthew,10,42,"And if anyone gives a cup of cold {water} to one of these little ones, just because they're down with the squad, I'm telling you, they'll totally get blessed and never miss out on their rewards, fam."
Matthew,11,1,"After Jesus finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he bounced to their cities to drop some knowledge and spread the word."
Matthew,11,2,"So, like, John was in jail, right? And he hears about all the cool stuff Jesus is doing. So he's like, 'Yo, I gotta check this out!' And he sends two of his homies to see what's up."
Matthew,11,3,"And like, they were all, 'Yo, are you the one we're waitin' for, or should we expect someone else?'"
Matthew,11,4,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, go and show John what's up with the stuff you're hearing and seeing, okay? 😎"
Matthew,11,5,"Yo, check it out - the blind start seein', the lame start walkin', lepers gettin' cleansed, the deaf hearin', even the dead bein' brought back to life! And yo, the poor? They get the good news preached to 'em, too."
Matthew,11,6,And lit is anyone who ain't trippin' over me.
Matthew,11,7,"And as they left, Jesus started talking to the crowd about John, saying, 'What did you all go to the desert to check out? A flimsy stick that blows around in the wind?'"
Matthew,11,8,"So, why did you even go out? Looking for a dude in fancy clothes? Well, let me tell you, people who rock those fancy outfits are chilling in the crib of kings."
Matthew,11,9,"So, what did you come here for? To spot a lit prophet? Totally! Let me tell you, this one's more than just a regular prophet."
Matthew,11,10,"This person, is the one they wrote about, like, check it out, I'm sending my messenger ahead of you to get everything ready for you."
Matthew,11,11,"Honestly, listen up fam, no one's outshined John the Baptist among all those born of women. But hey, even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is still way greater than him, no cap."
Matthew,11,12,"So, like, ever since John the Baptist was on the scene, the kingdom of heaven has been dealing with some serious chaos. It's a total struggle, and those who are forceful and assertive are the ones who manage to grab hold of it. Yeah, it's like they're pushing through the crowd to get their hands on it, you feel me?"
Matthew,11,13,"Like, all the prophets and the law, they were totally predicting stuff until John came along, you know?"
Matthew,11,14,"And if you're down to vibe with it, this is Elias, the dude everyone was waiting for."
Matthew,11,15,"If you're tuned in, then really listen up, my dudes."
Matthew,11,16,"So, like, let me try to explain what this generation is like. It's kinda like when kids are all chilling at the mall, calling out to their friends like, 'Yo, come over here!'"
Matthew,11,17,"And we're like, we played the music for you, but you didn't even bust a move; we expressed our sadness, but you didn't even show any emotion."
Matthew,11,18,"Yo, John was all about fasting and abstaining from food and drink, and peeps had the audacity to claim he was possessed by a demon."
Matthew,11,19,"Yo, this dude called the Son of man was all about chillin', grubbin', and sippin' on the finest wine. And let me tell you, people had the audacity to call him a foodie and a wine lover, like he was besties with tax collectors and party animals. But, you know what? Wisdom proves itself through the actions of those who follow it."
Matthew,11,20,"So, like, Jesus got kinda frustrated with the cities where he did the coolest miracles 'cause they didn't even bother to change their ways, you know?"
Matthew,11,21,"Oh no, it's not looking good for you, Chorazin! And Bethsaida, you're in trouble too! 'Cause if all those amazing miracles that happened around you had happened in Tyre and Sidon instead, they would've totally turned their lives around, like, ages ago, feeling all regretful and humbled."
Matthew,11,22,"But yo, listen up, I gotta tell you somethin'. When judgment day comes, it's gonna be way easier for Tyre and Sidon than for y'all, believe it or not."
Matthew,11,23,"Yo, Capernaum! You were all high and mighty, but get this - you're about to hit rock bottom. Like, straight up hellish. Just saying, if all those mind-blowing miracles that went down in your hood happened in Sodom, that place would still be standing today, no doubt."
Matthew,11,24,"But listen up, fam, I gotta tell you straight: when Judgment Day comes, the folks from Sodom will have an easier time compared to you. No cap."
Matthew,11,25,"Yo, Jesus was straight up grateful, man. He said, 'Mad props to you, Father, the big boss of the heavens and earth, for keeping all this knowledge on the DL from the intellectuals and sharing it with the young ones.'"
Matthew,11,26,"Like, yeah, Papa: that's like totally cool according to your vibes."
Matthew,11,27,"My Father has given me everything, and only the Father knows the Son truly, just as only the Son knows the Father. And it's up to the Son to reveal the Father to anyone {he} chooses."
Matthew,11,28,"Yo, come chill with me, all you peeps who work hard and carry heavy loads, I got you covered—I'll give you some serious downtime."
Matthew,11,29,"Yo, like, put on my vibes and vibe with me; 'cause I'm all chill and humble in my heart: and you'll find that inner peace for your souls."
Matthew,11,30,"Like, my yoke is legit chill and my burden is actually low-key light."
Matthew,12,1,"So Jesus was walking on the Sabbath and his crew was feeling hungry, so they started grabbing some corn and snacking on it."
Matthew,12,2,"But yo, when the Pharisees peeped that, they were like, 'Dude, check it out! Your crew be doin' stuff that's totally not cool on the Sabbath, yo!'"
Matthew,12,3,"Yo, like, he was all, 'Yo dudes, didn't you read about what David did when he was super hungry and his crew was with him?'"
Matthew,12,4,"So, like, he went into God's crib and grabbed some of that holy bread to munch on. But, like, that bread was only for the priests, not for him and his crew."
Matthew,12,5,"Yo, haven't you seen in the law how, like, on the sabbath days the priests in the temple do their thing and it's all good? No one's blaming them or anything."
Matthew,12,6,"Yo, listen up! I'm telling you, right here, right now, there's someone even more epic than the temple."
Matthew,12,7,"But if y'all actually knew what this meant, like having mercy instead of just going through the motions, you wouldn't have unfairly judged the innocent ones."
Matthew,12,8,"Bruh, the Son of man straight up be the boss of the sabbath day."
Matthew,12,9,"And after he left, he went straight to their synagogue:"
Matthew,12,10,"So, there was this dude whose hand was all messed up. And they came to him and asked, like, 'Yo, is it cool to heal people on the sabbath?' 'Cause they were totally trying to catch him doing something wrong."
Matthew,12,11,"And he was like, yo, imagine if one of y'all had a sheep, right? And then, on a chill Saturday, it falls into a pit. Would you not be, like, all over that, grabbing it and lifting it out?"
Matthew,12,12,"Yo, like how much cooler is a person than a sheep? So, it's totally legit to do good things on the sabbath days, ya feel me?"
Matthew,12,13,"Then he's like to the guy, 'Yo, extend your hand.' And the guy's like, 'Bet!' So he extends his hand and it's all good, just like the other one."
Matthew,12,14,"So, like, the Pharisees were totally triggered and had a whole meeting about how they could cancel him. #savage"
Matthew,12,15,"But when Jesus found out, he decided to dip out from there. And tons of people started following him, and he healed every single one of them."
Matthew,12,16,And told them not to flex about him:
Matthew,12,17,"So it would come true, just like Esaias the prophet said,"
Matthew,12,18,"Check out my chosen servant, he's my absolute fave and totally has my stamp of approval. I'm gonna give him my spirit, and he's gonna bring justice to all the non-believers out there."
Matthew,12,19,He won't be all about drama or making a scene; nobody's gonna hear him yelling in public.
Matthew,12,20,He won't break anyone who's already down and won't put out the faintest of sparks until justice prevails.
Matthew,12,21,"And the non-Jews will totally put their trust in him, no cap."
Matthew,12,22,"So this person showed up, totally possessed and couldn't see or speak. And guess what? Jesus totally fixed them up! Made 'em talk and see like it was no biggie."
Matthew,12,23,"Dude, everyone was so shook! They were like, 'Isn't this the son of David?'"
Matthew,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard that, they were like, 'Yo, this dude ain't casting out devils by his own power, he must be teaming up with Beelzebub, the main devil himself. By the way, Beelzebub also goes by Beelzebul.'"
Matthew,12,25,"Jesus totally read their minds and was like, yo, check it: when a kingdom starts beefin' with itself, it's bound to straight-up implode. And like, if a city or house starts tearing itself apart, forget about it, it won't even survive."
Matthew,12,26,"Dude, listen up! If Satan starts kicking out other Satans, he's totally going against himself. How can his kingdom even stay intact, bro?"
Matthew,12,27,"And, like, if I'm casting out demons and stuff with Beelzebub, then who are your kids casting them out with? So, like, they're gonna be the judges for you, fam."
Matthew,12,28,"But like, if I flex on these demons using the God-given powers, bro, that's when you should realize that the kingdom of God is straight up right in front of y'all."
Matthew,12,29,"Like, dude, imagine trying to break into a total badass's house and swipe all his stuff without tying him up first. That's like impossible! You gotta restrain the strong man first, and then you can totally raid his crib."
Matthew,12,30,"If you ain't rollin' with me, you straight up hatin'; and if you ain't helpin' me, you just spreadin' chaos."
Matthew,12,31,"So, listen up, y'all! I gotta tell ya, all types of sin and blasphemy can be pardoned for peeps, no prob. But dissing the Holy Spirit? Sorry, guys, that's a big no-no, can't be forgiven."
Matthew,12,32,"And if anyone says something bad about the Son of Man, they can be forgiven for it. But if anyone says something bad about the Holy Ghost, it won't be forgiven, not now, not ever."
Matthew,12,33,"Yo, here's the deal: a tree can either be all good and bumper crop, or totally messed up and rotten. 'Cause ya see, a tree's reputation is based on its fruit, ya know?"
Matthew,12,34,"Yo, you snakes! How can y'all, being so shady, talk all nice? 'Cause whatever comes out of your mouth is just what's already in your heart."
Matthew,12,35,"A decent person, from the good stuff in their heart, brings out good things, while a messed up person, from their messed up stuff in their heart, brings out messed up things."
Matthew,12,36,"But like, listen up, every single word that people casually let slip out of their mouths, they gotta answer for 'em on the judgment day, okay?"
Matthew,12,37,"Like, your words can either prove you righteous or totally bring you down, ya know?"
Matthew,12,38,"So, like, some of those scribes and Pharisees were all like, 'Hey, teacher! Show us a cool sign, please!'"
Matthew,12,39,"Yo, listen up! Jesus straight up told them, 'Y'all are always lookin' for some crazy sign, but I ain't gonna give you one, 'cept for the sign of Jonah, fam:"
Matthew,12,40,"Like, remember when Jonah was, like, stuck inside a big fish for three whole days and nights? Well, it's gonna be the same deal for the Son of man, but instead of a fish, He'll be chilling in the heart of the earth for three days and nights, you know?"
Matthew,12,41,"The guys from Nineveh are gonna come back and judge this generation, and they're gonna drag it down because they actually changed their ways when Jonah started preaching. And guess what? Someone even more awesome than Jonah is right here."
Matthew,12,42,"The queen from way down south is gonna show up at the final judgment with you guys and totally call you out. She came all the way from the ends of the earth just to hear Solomon drop some knowledge, but guess what? Someone even more awesome than Solomon is chillin' amongst you right now."
Matthew,12,43,"Once the evil spirit bounces out of someone, they go on a walk in empty spots, trying to chill out, but can't find any peace."
Matthew,12,44,"And then he's like, 'I'm gonna go back to the crib where I started,' and when he gets there, he sees that it's all empty, super clean, and perfectly decorated."
Matthew,12,45,"So, this dude goes and brings along seven even more messed up spirits than himself, and they all go in and set up shop there. And let me tell you, things go from bad to worse for that guy. And guess what? The same thing's gonna happen to this messed up generation, too."
Matthew,12,46,"While he was still talking to the crowd, his mom and his homies were waiting outside, wanting to talk to him."
Matthew,12,47,"Yo, someone's here looking for you. Your mom and your siblings are outside, and they want to have a chat with you."
Matthew,12,48,"But he like, totally responded to the person who told him, like, 'Who even is my mom, and like, who are my friends, dude?'"
Matthew,12,49,"Then he reached out his hand to his squad and was like, 'Check it, these are my day ones, my fam!'"
Matthew,12,50,"Anyone who does what my Dad in heaven wants is, like, my bro, sis, and mom."
Matthew,13,1,"Just then, Jesus left the crib and went to chill by the beach."
Matthew,13,2,"So, like, there were hella people all coming together to hang out with him, and it got so crowded that he hopped on a boat and took a seat, while everybody else stayed on the shore."
Matthew,13,3,"So, like, he started telling them a bunch of stories using these cool examples, and he was like, 'Yo, check this out: there was this dude who went out to plant some seeds;"
Matthew,13,4,"And like, when he, you know, planted those seeds, some, like, totally fell on the path, and then these birds swooped in and, like, devoured them all up, man:"
Matthew,13,5,"So, like, some of the seeds fell on rocky ground where there wasn't much dirt. And, like, they sprouted right away, but then, ya know, they died off cuz there wasn't enough dirt for their roots to go deep."
Matthew,13,6,"And when the sun came out, they got completely burnt; and since they didn't have any solid foundation, they just shriveled up and died."
Matthew,13,7,"Yo, so like, there were these seeds that were all thrown down, right? Some of 'em landed in this super thorny area, and guess what? The thorns grew up real fast and ended up suffocating those poor seeds. Bummer, right?"
Matthew,13,8,"But some of it fell on really fertile soil, and it totally thrived, like producing a crazy amount of fruit. Some grew a hundred times what was planted, some sixty times, and some thirty times."
Matthew,13,9,"If you've got ears that actually function, then listen up."
Matthew,13,10,"So, like, the disciples were all, yo, why are you speaking in parables to those peeps?"
Matthew,13,11,"He replied to them, saying, It's like, you guys have been blessed with the knowledge of the secrets of heaven's kingdom, but it's not something that's given to everyone else."
Matthew,13,12,"Yo, if you got something, you're gonna get even more, and you'll be ballin' hard. But if you ain't got nothing, even the little you got will be snatched away, no cap."
Matthew,13,13,"So, like, I speak in these stories, ya know? 'Cause even though they're looking, they don't really see, and even though they're listening, they don't really hear or get it."
Matthew,13,14,"And, like, the prophecy of Esaias, dude, it's like totally coming true, you know? Like, he was all, 'Listen up, peeps! You'll hear... but not really understand, ya know? And, like, you'll see... but not really get it, man.'"
Matthew,13,15,"You know, these people's hearts are just so unresponsive, their ears are totally tuned out, and they've willingly shut their eyes tight. It's like they don't want to see and hear the truth! If they did, they could actually understand it deep down, turn things around, and I could make them whole again."
Matthew,13,16,"But yo, your eyes be blessed 'cause they see, and your ears 'cause they hear."
Matthew,13,17,"LOL, listen up fam, I'm dead serious when I say that so many prophets and righteous peeps from back in the day wished they could witness what you all are witnessing right now. Like, they were hella curious to see and hear the stuff you actually get to experience, but they never got the chance, you know? It's a pretty lit privilege, gotta admit."
Matthew,13,18,"Okay, peeps, listen up and pay attention to this story about a gardener."
Matthew,13,19,"When someone hears about the kingdom but doesn't get it, then the evil one comes and snatches away what was planted in their heart. This is the person who heard the message but didn't really understand it."
Matthew,13,20,"But the person who gets the message but doesn't let it really sink in, they're the ones who hear it and get hyped about it right away;"
Matthew,13,21,"But he doesn't have a strong foundation within himself, so he only lasts for a short time. When tough times or haters show up because of what he believes, he quickly gets upset and loses faith. {upset: he messes up, or falls into doing something wrong}"
Matthew,13,22,"The one who gets the message but gets caught up in the distractions of the world and the obsession with wealth, ends up neglecting the message and not producing any good results."
Matthew,13,23,"But the person who absorbs the knowledge and truly grasps it is like the fertile soil. They not only understand the teachings, but also put them into action, yielding abundant results in different measures - some a hundred times, some sixty, and some thirty."
Matthew,13,24,"So, Jesus told them another story, ya know? He was like, 'Yo, the kingdom of heaven is like this dude who planted really solid seeds in his field:'"
Matthew,13,25,"But, like, when everyone was sleeping, this rival dude came and planted bad stuff among the good crops, and then peaced out."
Matthew,13,26,"But, like, when the plants started growing and bearing fruit, that's when the weeds also showed up."
Matthew,13,27,"Okay, so the homies working for the homeowner stepped up and were like, 'Yo, dude, didn't you plant some fire seeds in your field? So like, where did these whack weeds come from?'"
Matthew,13,28,"He was like, 'Yo, somebody messed this up. The squad was like, 'You want us to clean up the mess, fam?'"
Matthew,13,29,"But he was like, umm no way! If you start picking out the weeds, you might accidentally mess with the good stuff too, you know?"
Matthew,13,30,"Yo, let both of 'em chill and grow until it's time to harvest, ya know? When that time comes, I'll be like, 'Hey, reapers, round up those pesky weeds first and tie 'em up to burn 'em. But make sure you gather all the wheat and store it safely in my barn.'"
Matthew,13,31,"So Jesus told them another story, like, you know? He said, 'The kingdom of heaven is kinda like a teeny tiny mustard seed that this dude took and planted in his field, you know what I'm saying? Like, super small, but it grows into something huge! Like, whoa!'"
Matthew,13,32,"So like, this tiny seed might be the tiniest one ever, but when it grows up, it becomes this massive herb and turns into a legit tree! And then, birds from the sky come chill and make their homes in its branches. So cool, right?"
Matthew,13,33,"So, like, Jesus told them this other story, you know? He was all like, the kingdom of heaven is kinda like this yeast that a woman put in three measures of dough until the whole thing was full of yeast. Just so you know, those measures they're talking about, it's this container that's about the size of a big ol' bucket, but a little smaller than a gallon. Yeah, something like that."
Matthew,13,34,"Jesus was speaking to a whole bunch of people and he always used stories to get his point across, he never spoke to them without using a story:"
Matthew,13,35,"So like, this prophet dude was all, 'Hey, I'm gonna drop some mad parables and spill some seriously ancient secrets.' And then, it all went down to make sure the prophecy became reality. Pretty mind-blowing, right?"
Matthew,13,36,"So Jesus told everyone to peace out and he dipped back to the crib. Then his squad rolled up to him and were like, 'Yo, break down that story about the fake plants in the field.'"
Matthew,13,37,"And he's like, yo, listen up, the one who plants the dope seeds is the Son of man, ya know?"
Matthew,13,38,"The field is like, the whole world, ya know? And the good seed, they're the kids of the kingdom. But then you got these tares, man, they're like the kids of the wicked one or whatever."
Matthew,13,39,"The one who planted those seeds is the devil, while the harvest marks the ultimate conclusion; and the ones gathering the crops are like heavenly squad."
Matthew,13,40,"So like, when all the bad stuff gets collected and burned up, it's gonna be the same deal at the end of the world."
Matthew,13,41,The Son of man will totally send his angels to round up all the problematic stuff and the people who are doing sketchy things in his kingdom.
Matthew,13,42,"And they'll toss them into a blazing inferno: there'll be so much crying and grinding of teeth, like, major agony."
Matthew,13,43,"And the righteous ones gonna glow up like the sun in their Father's kingdom. If you got ears, then really listen up."
Matthew,13,44,"Yo, so the kingdom of heaven is kind of like when you stumble upon a hidden gem in a game, ya know? Picture this: You find this incredible treasure hidden in a field, and once you discover it, you can't help but keep it under wraps 'cause it's so rare. But here's the kicker - you're so stoked about finding it that you're ready to sell off all your other stuff just to buy that field and make it all yours. A total game changer, right?!"
Matthew,13,45,"Yo, listen up! The kingdom of heaven is basically like this cool dude who's on the hunt for some top-notch pearls:"
Matthew,13,46,"Yo, this person stumbled upon this sick pearl that was worth a ton. So, they straight up sold everything they had just to cop it."
Matthew,13,47,"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is kinda like a net, ya know? It's like when you throw that net into the sea and it catches all sorts of fish, all kinds of 'em, man!"
Matthew,13,48,"So, like, when the net was totally packed, they pulled it onto the shore, found a chill spot, and sorted the good stuff into containers, while tossing out the trash."
Matthew,13,49,This is how it's gonna go down in the end: the angels will show up and separate the bad people from the good ones.
Matthew,13,50,"And they'll be thrown into this like, super intense fire and there's gonna be a lot of crying and teeth-gritting, like, major pain, you know?"
Matthew,13,51,"Jesus says to them, Did you guys totally get what I just said? And they're like, Yeah, Lord."
Matthew,13,52,"And he was like, yo, listen up! So, every scribe who's all about the kingdom of heaven is basically like this boss dude who's got his stuff together. He keeps bringing out all kinds of cool and timeless stuff from his treasure stash, just mixing up the old and the new like a pro."
Matthew,13,53,"So, like, Jesus finished telling these stories, and then he peaced out from there."
Matthew,13,54,"And when he went back to his hometown, he dropped some serious knowledge and showcased his incredible skills at their spot called 'the synagogue'. People were totally mind-blown and were like, 'Where did this dude get all this wisdom and amazing abilities from?'"
Matthew,13,55,"Yo, isn't this the son of the carpenter? Like, his mom's name is Mary, right? And he's got bros named James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?"
Matthew,13,56,"And like, aren't his sisters all here with us? So, where did this guy get all this stuff from?"
Matthew,13,57,"People got offended by him. But Jesus was like, 'Yo, a prophet isn't respected in their own hometown or even their own crib.'"
Matthew,13,58,And he didn't do many epic things there because they didn't believe in him.
Matthew,14,1,"So like, back in the day, this dude named Herod the ruler dude heard all the cool stuff about Jesus, you know? He was like in charge of four provinces and stuff. Pretty wild, right?"
Matthew,14,2,"And he told his squad, 'Yo, that's John the Baptist! He straight up came back from the dead, and that's why he's flexin' with all those insane miracles happening around him. Lit AF, right?'"
Matthew,14,3,"So Herod was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna grab John and throw him in jail because of Herodias, who's Philip's wife and all that.'"
Matthew,14,4,"John was like, 'Dude, it's not cool for you to be with her.'"
Matthew,14,5,"And when he was about to kill him, he got super scared of the crowd because they all thought he was, like, a legit prophet or something."
Matthew,14,6,"So, like, when it was Herod's birthday party, Herodias' daughter busted out some sick dance moves and totally impressed everyone, especially Herod. It was like the center of attention, you know?"
Matthew,14,7,"And he was like, totally, making this crazy promise, like, legit swear on everything he had, that he would hook her up with whatever she asked for."
Matthew,14,8,"So like, this girl, after like, being told by her mom and stuff, was all like, 'Yo, give me John Baptist's head in, like, a fancy plate or something.'"
Matthew,14,9,"The king felt bad about it, but because he had made a promise in front of everyone at the table, he ordered to give it to her."
Matthew,14,10,"So he, like, sent someone to, um, behead John while he was, like, locked up in prison."
Matthew,14,11,"Then they brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mom."
Matthew,14,12,"Then his squad rolled up, grabbed the body, gave it a proper burial, and went to update Jesus."
Matthew,14,13,"When Jesus found out about it, he bounced outta there on a ship to a chill isolated spot. And when the squad got wind of it, they straight up started strolling behind him on foot, leaving the cities behind."
Matthew,14,14,Jesus went out and saw a huge crowd. He felt a deep compassion for them and healed all their sick peeps.
Matthew,14,15,"So, like, it was getting late and all, and his crew came up to him, saying, 'Dude, this place is, like, totally deserted, and it's way past mealtime. Tell the crowd to head into the nearby towns to grab some food for themselves.'"
Matthew,14,16,"But Jesus was like, 'No need for them to leave; just give them something to eat, guys'."
Matthew,14,17,"And they're like, yo dude, we only got like five loaves and, like, two fishes here."
Matthew,14,18,"He was like, yo, bring them over here to me."
Matthew,14,19,"Then he told everyone to chill on the grass, grabbed the five loaves and two fishes, and with his eyes toward the sky, he said a dope blessing, broke the bread, and passed it to his squad, who then passed it to everyone else."
Matthew,14,20,"And everyone chowed down, totally satisfied and stuff, and they gathered up the leftovers and ended up with twelve huge baskets full."
Matthew,14,21,"There were like 5K dudes who chowed down on the grub, plus the ladies and kids were also there."
Matthew,14,22,"Right away, Jesus told his squad to hop on a boat and beat him to the other side, while he dismissed the massive crowd."
Matthew,14,23,"And after he dismissed all the people, he headed to a chill mountain spot to have his prayer sesh. When the night rolled in, he was totally vibing alone."
Matthew,14,24,"But yo, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, getting rocked by some gnarly waves 'cause the wind was totally against it, man."
Matthew,14,25,"And like, in the middle of the night, Jesus rolls up to them, casually strolling on the sea like it's NBD."
Matthew,14,26,"When the squad peeped him strolling on the water, they got mad shook and were like, 'Yo, is that a ghost?' and straight up screamed 'cause they were scared AF."
Matthew,14,27,"Yo, Jesus wasted no time and came through, telling them, 'Chill out, fam; it's your boy over here, no need to be scared.'"
Matthew,14,28,"And Peter was like, 'Yo, Jesus, if that's really you, tell me to come walk on the water with you.'"
Matthew,14,29,"And he was like, 'Yo, come over here.' So Peter hopped off the boat and straight up, he walked on the water towards Jesus."
Matthew,14,30,"But ya know, when he peeped that wind bein' all wild and crazy, he got scared straight. And yo, he started to sink and hollered out, like, Lordd, save me!' {boisterous: or, strong}"
Matthew,14,31,"And right away, Jesus reached out his hand, grabbed him, and was like, 'Dude, seriously? Why did you even start doubting in the first place? You have, like, no chill! Make up your mind and have some faith!'"
Matthew,14,32,"And when they got onto the ship, the wind stopped blowing."
Matthew,14,33,"And like, those who were on the boat, they came up and totally respected him, and were like, no doubt, you're totally the Son of God, man."
Matthew,14,34,"And, like, after they crossed over, they totally entered the land of Gennesaret."
Matthew,14,35,"And when the guys from that area found out about him, they hit up everyone in the nearby hood and brought him all the sick fam;"
Matthew,14,36,"They were like, 'Please, can we just touch the edge of his clothes?' And everyone who touched it was completely healed."
Matthew,15,1,"So there were these scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem who approached Jesus, like,"
Matthew,15,2,"Yo, why are your disciples breaking the rules of the old folks? They don't even bother washing their hands before chowing down on some bread."
Matthew,15,3,"Yo, he totally clapped back and was like, 'Why are y'all breaking God's command with your old-school traditions?"
Matthew,15,4,"God was like, 'Yo, listen up! You gotta show mad respect to your fam, especially your parents. And if any fool starts dissin' their oldies, they better be ready to face the consequences and meet their demise.'"
Matthew,15,5,"But you're like, if anyone says to their parents, 'Sorry, I can't help you out financially, I've already given it all as a gift,'"
Matthew,15,6,"Don't forget to show mad respect to your parents, yo! It's like a must-do. But y'all messed up big time by putting your traditions before God's commandments, making them worthless."
Matthew,15,7,"Yo, hypocrites! Esaias totally called it when he prophesied about you, like, check this out,"
Matthew,15,8,"These peeps be talkin' 'bout me and showin' respect with their words, but deep down, they ain't really feelin' it in their hearts."
Matthew,15,9,"But like, they totally worship me for no reason, ya know? They're all about teaching human ideas instead of my commandments."
Matthew,15,10,"So he gathered everyone together and said, like, listen up and really get what I'm about to say:"
Matthew,15,11,It's not about what you eat that messes you up; it's about what you say that messes you up.
Matthew,15,12,"Once his squad rolled up and dropped this truth bomb on him, they were like, yo Jesus, you know those Pharisees got all butt-hurt after hearing what you just said?"
Matthew,15,13,"But he was like, 'Yo, check it, any plant that didn't come from my heavenly Father is gonna be straight up removed."
Matthew,15,14,"Y'all should just leave them be: they're like clueless influencers leading other clueless peeps. And you know what happens when one blind person follows another blind person? Yup, both end up in the ditch."
Matthew,15,15,"Yo, Peter spoke up and was like, 'Yo, break it down for us, man. Explain this parable to us.'"
Matthew,15,16,"And Jesus was like, yo, y'all still not getting it?"
Matthew,15,17,"Yo, don't you get it yet? Like, whatever you eat goes into your stomach and, y'know, eventually gets flushed out like waste?"
Matthew,15,18,"Yo, listen up! Here's the deal - what you say reflects what's deep down in your heart. And lemme tell ya, it's your words that can make or break ya."
Matthew,15,19,"Because, like, all the messed up stuff comes from deep down in our inner selves, you know? Like, the evil thoughts, the killings, cheating, hooking up randomly, stealing, lying about stuff, and yeah, even saying disrespectful things about religion, man."
Matthew,15,20,"These are the things that mess up a person: but like, eating with dirty hands doesn't mess you up, man."
Matthew,15,21,So Jesus bounced and headed to the chill spots of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew,15,22,"Yo, this woman from Canaan rolls up to Jesus and straight-up begs for mercy. She's like, 'Yo, I know you're the Son of David, O Lord! My daughter is seriously messed up, possessed by a demon and all.'"
Matthew,15,23,"But he totally ignored her. And his squad rolled up and were like, 'Bro, can you just send her away? She keeps calling after us.'"
Matthew,15,24,"He replied, 'Nah, I'm just here for the squad who's lost from the fam of Israel.'"
Matthew,15,25,"And like, she went up and totally showed mad respect to him, being all like, 'Yo, Lord, I seriously need your help right now.'"
Matthew,15,26,"But he, like, replied, 'Dude, it's not cool to take the food of the kids and give it to dogs.'"
Matthew,15,27,"And she was like, yeah, for real, Lord: even the dogs get to munch on the leftovers that fall from their owners' dining table."
Matthew,15,28,"Then Jesus replied to her, like, 'Wow, girl, your faith is legit amazing! Consider it done, whatever you want.' And her daughter was totally healed right then and there."
Matthew,15,29,"And Jesus bounced from there, and came close to the sick beach vibes of Galilee; and climbed up a lit mountain, and chilled there."
Matthew,15,30,"A whole bunch of people rolled up to Jesus, bringing along folks with disabilities like they couldn't walk, see, talk, or had disabilities and other problems. They straight up dropped them at Jesus' feet, and he totally fixed them up real good."
Matthew,15,31,"The crowd was totally shook when they witnessed the silent ones speaking up, the injured ones getting healed, the crippled ones walking, and the blind ones seeing. It was lit! They were all like, Praisee and glorify the God of Israel, fam!'"
Matthew,15,32,"So Jesus gathered his squad and said, 'I feel for the crowd, yo. They've been rollin' with me for three whole days and haven't eaten squat. I can't let them leave hungry, that'll mess them up on the way.'"
Matthew,15,33,"And his squad asks him, like, where do we even get enough bread out here in the middle of nowhere to feed this huge crowd?"
Matthew,15,34,"Jesus asked them, 'Yo, how much bread you got?' And they replied, 'Seven loaves and a few lil' fishes.'"
Matthew,15,35,"And he was like, 'Yo, everyone find a spot on the ground and chillax.'"
Matthew,15,36,"Then he grabbed the seven loaves and fishes, said thanks, broke them, and passed them to his squad, who then handed them out to the crowd."
Matthew,15,37,And they all chowed down and were totally stuffed: and they scooped up the leftovers and had seven baskets full.
Matthew,15,38,"There were, like, 4000 dudes who ate, not counting the ladies and kids."
Matthew,15,39,"So, like, Jesus told the crowd to leave and then he hopped on a boat and headed over to Magdala, you know, by the coast."
Matthew,16,1,"Yo, the Pharisees and Sadducees rolled up trying to test Jesus, asking him to flex and show 'em a heavenly sign."
Matthew,16,2,"And He's like, yo, when it's evening, you guys are all like, 'Oh, it's gonna be a nice day tomorrow!' 'Cause, you know, the sky's all red and stuff."
Matthew,16,3,"Yo, peeps! Listen up: In the morning, it's gonna be hella stormy today – the sky's all red and gloomy. But seriously, you guys can totally read the weather forecast by looking at the sky, right? So, why can't y'all recognize the signs of the times?"
Matthew,16,4,"This messed up and unfaithful generation be all about hunting for signs, but they ain't getting any except for the sign of the prophet Jonas. Then he bounced and left them hanging."
Matthew,16,5,"So, like, when Jesus and his squad reached the opposite shore, they totally spaced out and forgot to bring any bread."
Matthew,16,6,"Yo, listen up and be careful 'bout the vibe that them Pharisees and Sadducees be bringin'."
Matthew,16,7,"And they were like, 'Yo, we forgot to bring bread, that's why we hungry af.'"
Matthew,16,8,"When Jesus caught on, he was like, 'Yo, you guys with the weak faith, why are you all stressing out over the fact that you forgot to bring bread? 🍞'"
Matthew,16,9,"Y'all still not get it? Remember the time when we had only five loaves of bread for five thousand people? And we even had a bunch of baskets left over. Like, come on guys, it's not that hard!"
Matthew,16,10,"Yo, like remember when we had just seven loaves for the four thousand peeps? Can you even count how many baskets we ended up with, fam?"
Matthew,16,11,"Bro, why don't y'all get it? I wasn't talkin' about bread when I warned you to watch out for the Pharisees and Sadducees' corrupt ways."
Matthew,16,12,"So, like, they finally got it that when he was all, 'Yo, watch out for the leaven of bread,' he wasn't talkin' about actual bread, but about the messed up beliefs and teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Matthew,16,13,"So, Jesus rolls up to Caesarea Philippi and he's like, yo, disciples, tell me, who do people say I am, you know, the Son of man?"
Matthew,16,14,"So like, some people are like, 'Yo, you're totally John the Baptist,' and others are like, 'Nah, you're more like Elias or Jeremias, or maybe one of the prophets.'"
Matthew,16,15,"He's like, yo, who do you think I am?"
Matthew,16,16,"And Simon Peter was like, yo, you're the Christ, the Son of the Almighty God, no cap."
Matthew,16,17,"And Jesus was like, dude, you're totally blessed, Simon Barjona! 'Cause, like, this ain't some earthy insider info - it's a divine download straight from my heavenly Father!"
Matthew,16,18,"And like, yo, I gotta tell you, you're totally Peter, bro. And on this rock, I'm gonna build my church, and nothing from hell is gonna stand a chance against it. (Btw Peter means like, a solid rock or something, man.)"
Matthew,16,19,"I got you, fam! You're about to receive the keys to the heavenly kingdom. Whatever you lock down on Earth, heaven will back you up. And anything you set free on Earth, heaven will set free too."
Matthew,16,20,"Then he straight up told his squad to zip it and not spill the beans that he was the Jesus, the GOAT."
Matthew,16,21,"After that, Jesus started telling his squad that he had to head to Jerusalem and go through a ton of tough stuff at the hands of the big shots - the elders, chief priests, and scholars. He said he was gonna get killed, but don't worry 'cause he'll rise up on the third day."
Matthew,16,22,"So Peter, like, went up to Jesus and was all like, 'Dude, no way! This is totally not happening to you, Lord.'"
Matthew,16,23,"But he was like, 'Peter, bro, move aside! You're being all Satan-like, bringing negativity into my vibe. 'Cause you're not into God's stuff, you're all about worldly things, man."
Matthew,16,24,"Jesus told his squad, if anyone wants to roll with me, they gotta leave their ego behind, embrace their challenges, and ride alongside me."
Matthew,16,25,"If you try to hold onto your life so tight, you'll end up losing it; but if you're willing to let go and sacrifice your life for me, that's when you'll truly find it."
Matthew,16,26,"Like, what's the point if you hustle so hard, stack up the world, but end up losing your true self? Seriously, what can you even trade to get back your soul?"
Matthew,16,27,"The Son of man will rock up with his squad in his Father's splendor, and he's gonna hook everyone up with what they deserve based on their hustle."
Matthew,16,28,"For real, listen up! Some of y'all here won't even die before witnessing the Son of man rolling into his kingdom."
Matthew,17,1,"So, like, after six days, Jesus brings Peter, James, and John his bro, and takes them up to this super high mountain alone."
Matthew,17,2,"And then something crazy happened. Jesus went all glow-up mode, with his face shining brighter than the sun and his clothes looking fresher than ever."
Matthew,17,3,"And OMG, like, out of nowhere, Moses and Elias showed up and were just, like, totally talking to him and stuff."
Matthew,17,4,"So Peter spoke up and said to Jesus, 'Dude, it's rad to be chillin' here with you. If you're down, let's create three epic hangout spots – one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elias.'"
Matthew,17,5,"As soon as he started talking, a super lit cloud appeared and covered them. And from the cloud, a voice was like, 'Yo, check it, this is my all-time favorite Son that I'm totally vibing with. Y'all better listen to him, no cap.'"
Matthew,17,6,"And when the disciples heard that, they freaked out and fell on their face, totally scared."
Matthew,17,7,"So Jesus popped up and gave them a fist bump, saying, 'Yo, chill out and don't freak.'"
Matthew,17,8,"And when they like looked up, they were like, 'OMG, there was nobody there, just Jesus chillin' by himself.'"
Matthew,17,9,"Yo, when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus was like, 'Don't go spreading the vision to anyone until I come back from the dead, you feel me?'"
Matthew,17,10,"So, like, the disciples were all, 'Yo, Jesus, the scribes are always saying that Elijah has to come first. What's up with that?'"
Matthew,17,11,"And Jesus was like, yo, listen up. Elias is gonna come first, for real, and he's gonna make everything right again."
Matthew,17,12,"Yo, listen up fam. So, just to break it down for y'all, Elijah actually came before, but people didn't even recognize him, you feel? They straight up did whatever they wanted with him. And let me tell you, it's gonna be the same deal for the Son of man. He gonna go through some serious suffering at their hands, for real."
Matthew,17,13,"Yo, the disciples were like, 'Oh snap, Jesus was talkin' about John the Baptist!'"
Matthew,17,14,"And when they finally reached the large group, this dude showed up, straight up kneeling in front of Jesus and said,"
Matthew,17,15,"Yo, God, please show some compassion for my kid. He's like, crazy and seriously tormented. He keeps freakin' falling into fires and water all the time."
Matthew,17,16,"So I brought the guy to your crew, but they couldn't fix him, no cap."
Matthew,17,17,"Yo, Jesus was like: 'Seriously guys, why is everyone so lacking in faith and twisted in their thinking? How much longer do I have to stick around and put up with this? Just bring the person over here to me.'"
Matthew,17,18,"And Jesus totally called out the devil, and he bounced out of there: and the kid was healed right away."
Matthew,17,19,"So the disciples went to Jesus privately and asked, why weren't we able to kick him out?"
Matthew,17,20,"Jesus was like, yo guys, it's because you don't believe enough. Seriously, if you even had a tiny bit of faith, like as small as a mustard seed, you could totally tell that mountain over there to move somewhere else, and boom, it's gonna move. And legit, nothing will be impossible for you then, like no cap."
Matthew,17,21,"But, like, this type of situation only gets resolved through deep prayer and hardcore fasting."
Matthew,17,22,"So, like, Jesus was chillin' in Galilee, right? And he straight up told his homies, 'Yo, the Son of man is gonna get betrayed by these dudes."
Matthew,17,23,"And they're gonna get rid of him, but on the third day, he's gonna come back to life. And they were like super, super bummed about it."
Matthew,17,24,"So, when they arrived in Capernaum, the peeps who collected cash came up to Peter and were like, 'Yo, doesn't your boss pay up?'"
Matthew,17,25,"Jesus was like, 'Yeah, bro.' So when he came inside the house, Jesus beat him to the punch and was like, 'Yo Simon, whatcha thinkin'? Who do the big shot kings of the earth tax and collect money from? Their own kids or random people?'"
Matthew,17,26,"Peter's like, 'They're strangers, duh.' Jesus replies, 'Well, if they're strangers, then the kids are off the hook.'"
Matthew,17,27,"But hey, just so we don't cause any drama, head on over to the sea, throw in a fishing line and reel in the first fish that pops up. And guess what? When you open its mouth, there will be some cash hanging out. Take it and give it to them, for you and me. It's like a silver coin worth a couple of bucks, about fifty-five cents. No kidding!"
Matthew,18,1,"So, the disciples roll up to Jesus like, 'Yo, who's the top dog in heaven?'"
Matthew,18,2,"So, Jesus was like, 'Yo, come here, kiddo!' And he like put the kid right in the middle of the crew,"
Matthew,18,3,"And I was like, for real tho, listen up! Unless you change your whole vibe and start being all innocent and pure like little kids, forget about making it into heaven, alright?"
Matthew,18,4,"So, like, anyone who, you know, gets all humble like a little kid, well they're, like, totally the top dog in heaven."
Matthew,18,5,"Yo, if you welcome a little kid in my name, you're totally welcoming me. #JustSaying"
Matthew,18,6,But anyone who hurts one of these younger believers in me would be better off having a big weight tied around their neck and getting tossed into the deepest part of the ocean.
Matthew,18,7,"Dang, the world is in trouble because of all these messed up things happening! Like, it's bound to happen, but seriously, that person who causes the trouble is in for some major trouble themselves!"
Matthew,18,8,"If your hand or your foot is causing trouble, get rid of them and distance yourself: it's way better to go through life with a limp or being imperfect, than to be thrown into eternal flames with two hands or two feet."
Matthew,18,9,"If something you see bothers you, get rid of it and distance yourself from it: it's way cooler to embrace a life with just one perspective than to end up in a fiery mess with a pair of eyes."
Matthew,18,10,"Yo, listen up and don't sleep on these little ones, 'cause let me tell you, up in heaven, their angels stay posted and always see my Father's face."
Matthew,18,11,"Yo, the Son of man came to save what was lost, ya know?"
Matthew,18,12,"Yo, listen up fam. Picture this: a dude has like a hundred sheep, right? But one of them decides to dip and goes off on its own path. Would that guy just chill with the rest of the flock? Nah, bro. He goes all out, hiking up those mountains, searching high and low for that one lost sheep."
Matthew,18,13,"And if he actually finds it, I swear to you, he's way more stoked about that one sheep than the other ninety-nine that didn't wander off."
Matthew,18,14,"But, like, for real, God up in heaven doesn't want any of these little dudes to get wrecked."
Matthew,18,15,"Btw, if your bro does you wrong, hit him up and just talk it out, one on one. If he listens to you, you've totally won him back."
Matthew,18,16,"But if he doesn't listen to you, then bring along one or two extra peeps, so that with a couple of witnesses everything can be confirmed."
Matthew,18,17,"And if he ignores what they say, bring it up to the whole crew. But if he still ignores the crew, consider him like someone from another scene and a total outsider."
Matthew,18,18,"Yo, listen up! I'm telling you for real, whatever you guys decide here on Earth, it's gonna be the same deal up in heaven. So if you're making some things happen or letting go of stuff, it's gonna have the same effect up there too."
Matthew,18,19,"Alright y'all, listen up! Here's the deal: If two of you are totally vibing and agree on something here on Earth, and you ask for it, boom! Consider it done! My pops up in heaven will make it happen. No cap, fam."
Matthew,18,20,"Like, if there's, like, a small crew of two or three people vibin' in my name, I'm totally there with them, you know?"
Matthew,18,21,"So this dude Peter walks up to Jesus and asks, 'Yo, Jesus, how many times should I forgive my bro if he keeps screwing up and messing with me? Like, should I do it seven times?'"
Matthew,18,22,"Jesus is like, yo, I'm not just talkin' seven times, bro. I'm talkin' like seven times seventy. Unlimited forgiveness, man."
Matthew,18,23,"So, the kingdom of heaven is basically like this one dude, who's a king and all, and he decides to check up on his servants and see how they're doing."
Matthew,18,24,"And when he was counting, someone came to him who owed him a massive amount of money. (FYI, a talent is equal to 750 ounces of silver, which at the current rate of 5 shillings per ounce is a whole lot of cash.)"
Matthew,18,25,"But since he had no money to pay, his boss ordered him to be sold along with his partner, kids, and everything he owned, just to settle the debt."
Matthew,18,26,"So the servant totally prostrated themselves and showed mad respect, like, 'Yo Lord, please be patient with me and I'll totally pay you everything, no doubt.'"
Matthew,18,27,"Then the boss of that servant totally felt for him, and set him free, and wiped out all his debt."
Matthew,18,28,"But then this worker went out and came across his coworker who owed him a small amount of money, about a hundred pence. And he grabbed him and yelled at him, demanding him to pay back what he owed. (Just FYI, a Roman penny is like the eighth part of an ounce, and after converting it, it's around seven pence halfpenny or about fourteen cents.)"
Matthew,18,29,"And his squad member dropped to the ground, begging him like, 'Yo, just give me some time and I'll totally pay you back in full.'"
Matthew,18,30,"But he was like, 'Nah,', and straight up sent him to jail until he could pay off what he owed."
Matthew,18,31,"So when his friends saw what happened, they were totally bummed out and went and spilled the tea to their boss about everything that went down."
Matthew,18,32,"So his boss, when he called him, was like, 'Yo, you messed up big time, but I forgave you all that debt because you reached out to me and asked for forgiveness:"
Matthew,18,33,"Yo, shouldn't you have shown some empathy for your homie, just like I showed you some mercy?"
Matthew,18,34,"And his boss got really mad and handed him over to the haters, until he paid back everything he owed."
Matthew,18,35,"Just like that, my heavenly Father will do the same to you if you don't forgive your bros from the heart for their wrongdoings."
Matthew,19,1,"And like, after Jesus finished saying all this stuff, he left Galilee and went to the chill areas of Judaea on the other side of the Jordan river."
Matthew,19,2,"And like, so many people were totally following him, and he like, healed them all there."
Matthew,19,3,"So, like, these Pharisees rolled up to Jesus and tried to mess with him, asking him, 'Yo dude, is it cool for a guy to ditch his wife for, like, any reason?'"
Matthew,19,4,"And he's like, yo, haven't you guys read? Like, the one who created humans in the beginning made them as guys and gals, no cap,"
Matthew,19,5,"And like, he was like, yo, a guy should ditch his fam and be like super attached to his girl, and they'll be like this ultimate soul connection or something?"
Matthew,19,6,"So, like, they're not two separate people anymore but, like, totally one, ya know? And if God's the one who made them one, then people better not try to split them apart or whatever."
Matthew,19,7,"They were like, yo, why did Moses tell us we gotta write up divorce papers and break it off with our partners?"
Matthew,19,8,"He's like, yo, Moses let you divorce your wives 'cause y'all hearts were too stubborn, but that's not how it's supposed to be from the start, bruh."
Matthew,19,9,"Yo, listen up. If a person breaks up with their spouse, unless it's 'cause of cheating, and starts dating someone new, they're straight up committing adultery. And if someone marries the person who got dumped, they're also committing adultery. It's a serious business, man."
Matthew,19,10,"His squad says to him, like bruh, if being married is that rough for the guy, maybe it ain't worth tying the knot."
Matthew,19,11,"But he was like, yo, not everyone can handle what I'm saying, only those who are given the understanding."
Matthew,19,12,"Yo, listen up! There are a few peeps out there who were born eunuchs, like from the get-go. And then there are those who became eunuchs because of others, like by choice or something. And get this, there are even some eunuchs who willingly made themselves eunuchs all for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. So, if you can understand what's being said here, then go ahead and absorb this wisdom."
Matthew,19,13,"So there were these little kids brought to Jesus, and people wanted him to touch them and pray for them. But the disciples were like, 'No way, no kids allowed!'"
Matthew,19,14,"But Jesus was like, yo let the little homies come chill with me, don't be stoppin' them. 'Cause the kingdom of heaven is all about the vibes they bring."
Matthew,19,15,"And he was like, yo, he put his hands on them, and then he dipped from there."
Matthew,19,16,"Yo, check it. Someone rolled up to him and was like, 'Hey, good vibes Master, what's the key to eternal life, ya know? Like what's the move?'"
Matthew,19,17,"And he was like, yo dude, why you calling me good? Only one that’s truly good is God, bruh. But if you wanna score that eternal life, you gotta follow the commandments."
Matthew,19,18,"He's like, 'Which ones?' Jesus was like, 'Don't kill anyone, don't cheat on your partner, don't be a thief, don't lie about people,'"
Matthew,19,19,"Respect your fam squad👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 and spread the love to your homies🤝, just like you dig yourself."
Matthew,19,20,"The dude was like, 'Yo, I've been all about keeping it real since I was young. But like, what else do I need to do though?'"
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus was like, if you really wanna level up, bro, just sell all your stuff, give the cash to the needy, and you'll be stacking up major heavenly rewards, ya know? Then come chill with me and become one of my squad."
Matthew,19,22,"But like, when the guy heard that, he got all bummed out and dipped 'cause he had a ton of stuff, you know."
Matthew,19,23,"Yo, listen up, fam! Jesus just straight up told his squad, like for real, that it's crazy hard for a rich dude to get into the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,19,24,"And like, seriously, I gotta say this again. It's, like, so impossible for a rich dude to enter the kingdom of God, bro. It's even more far-fetched than a frickin' camel squeezing through the tiniest needle hole, man."
Matthew,19,25,"When the disciples heard that, they were totally shook, like, who on earth can actually be saved though?"
Matthew,19,26,"But Jesus saw them and said, like listen up, guys, with humans, this is like totally impossible, but with God, yo, anything is possible."
Matthew,19,27,"Yo, Peter spoke up and was like, listen up, we've given up everything to roll with you; so what's in it for us, fam?"
Matthew,19,28,"So Jesus was like, 'Yo fam, no cap, listen up. Those of you who've been rollin' with me, when everything gets lit again and I'm sittin' on my epic throne, all of y'all gonna sit on twelve more thrones and help me judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Matthew,19,29,"And anyone who has left behind their crib, squad, fam, parents, bae, squadlettes, or wealth, all for the sake of repping me, will get blessed a hundred times over and score that eternal life, no cap."
Matthew,19,30,"Like, a lot of people who think they're all that and get to be in the front row will actually end up being in the back of the line. And on the flip side, those who usually get left behind will end up being the ones to take the lead."
Matthew,20,1,"So, picture this: The kingdom of heaven is basically this guy, right? He's like a boss of his own crib, heading out in the morning to recruit some peeps to work in his dope vineyard."
Matthew,20,2,"And when he finally struck a deal with the workers for just a small sum per day, he sent them off to work in his vineyard. {penny: The Roman penny is like one-eighth of an ounce, which is worth about seven and a half pence after converting from five shillings per ounce. So it's approximately equal to fourteen cents}"
Matthew,20,3,"So, like, around 9 AM, he went out and saw some other people just chillin' and not doing anything in the market,"
Matthew,20,4,"And they were like, 'Hey, you all gotta head to the vineyard too. I'll hook you up with what's fair.' And off they went, no biggie."
Matthew,20,5,He went out again around 6 and 9 o'clock and did the same thing.
Matthew,20,6,"And around 11am, he went out and saw some others just chilling, not doing anything, and he said to them, 'Why are you all just standing here doing nothing all day?'"
Matthew,20,7,"They're like, 'No one's hiring us, bro.' And he's like, 'Yo, go to the vineyard too and you'll get whatever's fair, for real.'"
Matthew,20,8,"So, like, when it got late, the boss of the vineyard tells his manager, 'Yo, summon the workers and pay them, starting from the most recent peeps and going all the way back to the OGs.'"
Matthew,20,9,"And when those who got the gig around the last minute arrived, they each received a dollar."
Matthew,20,10,"But when the first group arrived, they thought they would get a bigger reward; but in the end, everyone got the same amount."
Matthew,20,11,"And when they got it, they started complaining about the dude running the place,"
Matthew,20,12,"They were like, 'Um, these people came in at the last minute and did, like, only one hour of work! And you're giving them the same reward as us, who've been working hard all day in the scorching heat!'"
Matthew,20,13,"But he's like, yo, listen up, I didn't do you dirty, bro. We made a deal for a fair price, didn't we?"
Matthew,20,14,"Yo, take what's yours and bounce: I'm gonna hook up this last person just like I did with you."
Matthew,20,15,"Yo, don't I have the right to do whatever I want with my own stuff? Why you gotta be jealous just because I'm being generous?"
Matthew,20,16,"So like, the ones who think they're first and all that, they'll actually end up last. And the people who seem last, well, they're gonna be first. 'Cause honestly, there's gonna be a lot of folks invited, but only a few get chosen."
Matthew,20,17,"So, like, Jesus was heading to Jerusalem and he, like, pulled the twelve disciples aside while they were on their journey, and he started talking to them, saying,"
Matthew,20,18,"Yo, listen up, we're heading to Jerusalem, and the Son of man is gonna get ratted out to the top dogs - the chief priests and the scribes. And guess what? They're gonna straight up sentence him to death."
Matthew,20,19,"And they'll hand him over to the non-believers to make fun of, beat up, and put him on the cross. But don't worry, on the third day he'll come back to life."
Matthew,20,20,"So like, this lady who's the mom of Zebedee's kids rolls up to Jesus with her sons and straight-up respects him and asks for a favor."
Matthew,20,21,"And he was like, 'What's up with you?' She was all like, 'Can you, like, hook it up for my two sons to be sitting at your right and left in your kingdom?'"
Matthew,20,22,"But Jesus responded and was like, 'Dude, you have no idea what you're asking for. Can you handle sippin' from the same cup as me and gettin' baptized like I did?' And they were all, 'Yeah bro, we got this!'"
Matthew,20,23,"And he's like, 'You guys are gonna totally sip from my cup and get dunked in the same way I did, but who gets to sit on my right or left? Not my call, fam. My Dad's got it all planned out and ready for those who deserve it.'"
Matthew,20,24,"And when the ten heard that, they were totally triggered and super mad at the two bros."
Matthew,20,25,"But Jesus gathered them together and said, Y'all know how those big shots in the world boss people around and throw their weight around, right?"
Matthew,20,26,"But it ain't gonna be like that for you guys: if you wanna be all awesome and stuff, then you gotta be a servant for everyone else."
Matthew,20,27,"And whoever wants to be the leader here, let them be the one who serves everyone else:"
Matthew,20,28,"Yo, the Son of man didn't come to be all served up, but to serve and give up His life for many peeps."
Matthew,20,29,"As they were leaving Jericho, a massive crew started following him."
Matthew,20,30,"Yo, check it out, there were these two blind dudes chilling by the road, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they straight up yelled, asking for some mercy, like 'Yo, have mercy on us, bro! You the Son of David and all!'"
Matthew,20,31,"The crowd told them to shut up, but they kept on shouting even louder, saying, 'Please show us mercy, O Lord, you're like the Son of David.'"
Matthew,20,32,"So like, Jesus stopped in his tracks and reached out to them, asking, 'Yo, what can I do for you?'"
Matthew,20,33,"They're like, 'Yo, can you, like, open up our eyes, bro?'"
Matthew,20,34,"So Jesus was hella moved {on them}, and reached out and tapped their eyes: and BOOM, their eyes got clear vision, and they totally started following him."
Matthew,21,1,"So like, when they were getting close to Jerusalem, and arrived at this place called Bethphage, right by the Mount of Olives, Jesus was like, 'Yo, I need two of my chill disciples to go do something for me,'"
Matthew,21,2,"Yo, listen up! Head to the village across from you, and you'll find a dope donkey tied up with her baby colt. Untie them and bring them to me, pronto."
Matthew,21,3,"If anyone asks you for something, just tell them that the Lord needs it, and they will send it right away."
Matthew,21,4,"So basically, this whole thing happened just to make sure that what the prophet said would come true, you know?"
Matthew,21,5,"Yo, listen up, daughter of Sion! Check it out, your King is on His way to you, being all humble and chill, riding on an ass and a cute little baby donkey."
Matthew,21,6,"So the squad dipped and did what Jesus told them to do,"
Matthew,21,7,"They brought the donkey and the young donkey, and dressed them up, then they made {him} sit on them."
Matthew,21,8,"And, like, a massive crowd started throwing their clothes on the ground as a sort of red carpet situation. Some even grabbed branches from the nearby trees and scattered them all over the path."
Matthew,21,9,"And all the people who were in front and behind were shouting, like, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! So blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna to the max!'"
Matthew,21,10,"And when he arrived in Jerusalem, the whole city was shook, like OMG, asking, Who's this dude?"
Matthew,21,11,"Yo, the crowd was like, 'This here is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.'"
Matthew,21,12,So Jesus walked into the temple of God and kicked out all those who were selling and buying stuff there. He totally wrecked the tables of the moneychangers and messed up the seats of those selling doves.
Matthew,21,13,"And he was like, listen up, it says in the book, my crib is supposed to be for praying and whatnot, but y'all turned it into a spot for shady business."
Matthew,21,14,"So, like, there were these blind and lame peeps who went up to him in the temple, and he totally healed them, man. It was, like, amazing!"
Matthew,21,15,"But, like, the big shot religious dudes and smart guys were totally salty when they peeped the amazing stuff that Jesus was doing, and all these kids in the temple were straight up going, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!'. It made them hella mad, no cap."
Matthew,21,16,"He was like, 'Yo, you hearing what these people are saying?' And Jesus was like, 'Yeah, haven't y'all ever read? Little kids be droppin' some serious fire with their praise!'"
Matthew,21,17,"And he dipped out of that place and headed to Bethany, where he crashed for the night."
Matthew,21,18,"So, like, in the morning when he went back to the city, he was totally starving."
Matthew,21,19,"So, like, Jesus was walking and he spotted a fig tree. He went up to it, hoping to find some juicy figs to munch on. But, to his disappointment, there were only leaves and no fruit! He got kinda mad and was like, 'Well, you're never gonna bear fruit again, bro!' And just like that, the fig tree dried up and withered away."
Matthew,21,20,"When the disciples peeped that, they were shook and like, OMG, how did that fig tree die so fast!?"
Matthew,21,21,"Jesus, like, responded to them, and he was all like, 'Seriously dudes, listen up! If you believe in something with all your heart and don't second-guess yourself, you won't just make this fig tree shrivel up, but also if you straight-up tell a mountain to yeet itself into the ocean, it'll actually happen.'"
Matthew,21,22,"And, like, seriously, whatever you ask for in your prayers, as long as you believe, it's totally gonna happen. No cap!"
Matthew,21,23,"As Jesus entered the temple, some of the top religious leaders and older folks approached Him while He was teaching. They asked, 'Yo, who gave you the power to do all these things? And under whose authority are you actin'?"
Matthew,21,24,"And Jesus was like, yo, I got a question for y'all too. If you answer mine, I'll drop some knowledge on you about where my authority comes from."
Matthew,21,25,"Yo, that John's baptism, where did it come from? Straight from heaven or just some human invention? And they started questioning among themselves, like, if we say it's from heaven, then he's gonna be like, 'Yo, why didn't you believe him then?'"
Matthew,21,26,"But like, if we're being honest, if we tell everyone that John's message was just from regular people, we're gonna have a major problem on our hands, 'cause literally everyone thinks he's a legit prophet."
Matthew,21,27,"So, like, Jesus asked them, and they were all like, 'Uhh, we don't know!' And Jesus was like, 'Well, I'm not gonna tell you either, like, what authority I have to do all these amazing things.'"
Matthew,21,28,"Anyway, hear this out! There was this dude who had not one, but two bros. So he rolls up to the first bro and straight up tells him, 'Yo, son, head over to my vineyard and start workin' today."
Matthew,21,29,"He was like, 'Nah, I'm good.' But then he felt bad about it and changed his mind, so he actually went."
Matthew,21,30,"Then he went to the second person and said the same thing. The person replied, 'Yeah, I'll do it,' but didn't end up doing it."
Matthew,21,31,"Like, which one of them actually did what their dad wanted? And they're all like, 'The first one.' Then Jesus is like, 'For real, let me tell you something, bro. No cap, but tax collectors and sex workers are heading into God's kingdom before you guys do.'"
Matthew,21,32,"Yo, John came at you with all that righteousness, but y'all didn't believe him. Meanwhile, the tax collectors and the escorts were all about his vibe and actually believed in him. And guess what? Even after seeing all that, y'all didn't even bother to change, so you could believe in him too."
Matthew,21,33,"Listen up, here's another story: There was this person who owned a house and decided to plant a vineyard. They put up a fence around it, dug a place to make wine, and even built a tower. Then, they rented it out to some farmers and went away for a long time."
Matthew,21,34,"And like, when it was almost time to harvest the fruit, he like, sent his homies to the farmers, so they could collect the goods."
Matthew,21,35,"And the workers straight up grabbed the guy's servants, straight up beat up one of them, straight up killed another one, and straight up stoned another one."
Matthew,21,36,"Once again, he hit up his squad with even more servants than before, and they got treated the same way, no cap."
Matthew,21,37,"But like, in the end, he sent his son to them and was all like, 'Yo, they better show respect to my son.'"
Matthew,21,38,"But yo, when the vineyard workers peeped the son, they were like, 'Yo, this dude be inheriting everything, let's straight up murder him and take his 'ish.'"
Matthew,21,39,"So, like, they grabbed him and, like, kicked him out of the vineyard, and, like, totally killed him, man."
Matthew,21,40,"So, like, when the boss of the vineyard shows up, what's he gonna do to those workers?"
Matthew,21,41,"They were like, 'Yo, he's totally gonna wreck those evil dudes and find new peeps to take care of his vineyard. They'll be legit and deliver the goods at the right time.'"
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus be like, yo did y'all even read in the Bible? The stone that the builders threw shade on is now the top dog: this is all God's doing and it's freakin' amazing, man!"
Matthew,21,43,"So, let me tell you, God's kingdom is gonna be snatched away from y'all and handed over to a nation that's actually producing good stuff."
Matthew,21,44,"And anyone who trips over this thing will get messed up, but whoever it lands on will get absolutely wrecked."
Matthew,21,45,"So, like, the top priests and Pharisees, they listened to his stories, and they totally got that he was talking about them."
Matthew,21,46,"But when they tried to grab him, they were scared of the crowd 'cause they thought he was a legit prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"So, imagine this sick kingdom of heaven, right? It's like when this totally rad king decides to throw this lit wedding bash for his own son."
Matthew,22,2,"So the guy sent out his crew to hit up the invitees for the wedding, but they straight up ghosted and didn't show."
Matthew,22,3,"Once more, he sent out more servants, like, telling the invited guests like, 'Yo, check it out, I've totally set up this awesome feast: I've slaughtered my oxen and my fattened animals, and everything is ready to go, so, like, come join the wedding celebration, dudes!'"
Matthew,22,4,"But, like, they totally didn't take it seriously and just went about doing their own thing. One went back to his farm, and another was like, 'Sorry, gotta focus on my merch!'"
Matthew,22,5,And the leftovers totally dissed his servants and straight up killed them.
Matthew,22,6,"But when the king found out, he got super mad and sent his armies to totally wreck those murderers and burn down their whole city."
Matthew,22,7,"Then he's like, yo, to his squad, the lit wedding is about to go down, but the peeps who got invited ain't even on the same level, like, not worthy and stuff."
Matthew,22,8,"So, like, go out into the streets and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding, okay?"
Matthew,22,9,"So like, those helpers went out on the roads and brought together whoever they could find, no matter if they were like, not that great or totally awesome: and then the wedding was filled with guests."
Matthew,22,10,"So, when the king entered the party, he noticed this one dude who was, like, not dressed appropriately for a wedding:"
Matthew,22,11,"And he's like, bro, how did you even get in here without wearing the proper wedding attire? And the dude couldn't say anything, totally speechless, man."
Matthew,22,12,"And then the king was like, 'Yo, servants, tie this dude up real good and kick him out into the total darkness, where there's gonna be a whole lot of crying and grinding of teeth."
Matthew,22,13,"Like, a lot of peeps get the call, but only a few actually get picked."
Matthew,22,14,So the Pharisees got together and brainstormed on how they could trap him with his words.
Matthew,22,15,"So they went and sent their squad to him, along with the Homies, and were like, 'Yo, Teacher, we know you're legit and dropping wisdom about God without fakin' it. You don't care about what anyone thinks or their status in society.'"
Matthew,22,16,"So, like, what do you think? Is it cool to pay taxes to Caesar or nah?"
Matthew,22,17,"But Jesus totally saw through their BS and was like, why are you testing me, you fake people?"
Matthew,22,18,Can you show me the tax money? So they brought him a coin. {The coin was worth seven and a half pennies}
Matthew,22,19,"And he's like, 'yo, whose pic is this and what's written under it?'"
Matthew,22,20,"They're like, totally saying to him, 'Caesar's.' And then he's like, 'Alright, fam, give Caesar what's his, you know? And don't forget to give God what's his too.'"
Matthew,22,21,"After hearing that, they were totally shook and decided to peace out, going their own way."
Matthew,22,22,"On that very day, the Sadducees approached him with their belief that there's no afterlife, and questioned him,"
Matthew,22,23,"So, like, they were saying, 'Hey, you know how Moses was all like, if a dude dies without having any kids, his brother should totally step up and marry his wife and make babies for him? Yeah, that's the deal.'"
Matthew,22,24,"So, there were like, seven brothers in our crew, right? The oldest one got hitched and unfortunately, he passed away without having any kids. So, according to the deal, his wife became his brother's responsibility and all."
Matthew,22,25,"Same goes for the second, third, all the way up to the seventh. {seventh: Gr. seven}"
Matthew,22,26,"And finally, the woman passed away too."
Matthew,22,27,"So like, in the whole resurrection scene, whose wife is she gonna be? 'Cause, like, all seven of them had her, you know?"
Matthew,22,28,"Jesus like totally responded and was like, 'Yo, you're so off track! You have zero clue about the scriptures and the insane power of God.'"
Matthew,22,29,"In the resurrection, it's not about getting hitched or being someone's 'plus one', but rather becoming heavenly angels, no marriage vibes."
Matthew,22,30,"Yo, about the whole resurrection thing, haven't you peeps read what God said to you?"
Matthew,22,31,"Bruh, I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Just so you know, God is all about the living, not the dead. #facts"
Matthew,22,32,"And when the crowd heard that, they were shook by his teachings."
Matthew,22,33,"But when the Pharisees found out that he totally shut down the Sadducees, they all came together."
Matthew,22,34,"So, like, this dude, who happened to be a lawyer, comes up and tries to trap this other dude with a question, asking him and stuff."
Matthew,22,35,"Yo, teach, what's the sickest commandment out of all the laws?"
Matthew,22,36,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, dude, you gotta love God with all your heart, your soul, and your mind, ya feel?"
Matthew,22,37,"This is like the ultimate rule, guys."
Matthew,22,38,"And, like, the second rule is just as important, you gotta love your neighbor just like you love yourself."
Matthew,22,39,These two commandments are the foundation for every law and prophecy.
Matthew,22,40,"So, like, Jesus was chilling with the Pharisees, and he was all like, yo, let me ask you something,"
Matthew,22,41,"So, like, they're asking, what's your take on Jesus? Whose kid is He? And they're like, oh, He's David's son for sure."
Matthew,22,42,"He's like, yo, David was mad deep when he called him Lord, check it out,"
Matthew,22,43,"God was like, to my main dude he said, come chill by my side until I totally crush all your haters beneath your feet."
Matthew,22,44,"So, if David is like, calling him Lord, then how can he be his son?"
Matthew,22,45,"And no one could even say anything back to him, and no one dared to ask him any more questions from that day on."
Matthew,23,1,"So, Jesus started talking to all the people, including his crew,"
Matthew,23,2,"Like, the scribes and Pharisees, dude, they totally take up Moses' spot, you know?"
Matthew,23,3,"So, like, whatever instructions they give you, listen up and follow through with them, but don't imitate their actions because they talk the talk, but don't walk the walk."
Matthew,23,4,"They be making people carry heavy and hard-to-handle stuff, putting it on their backs, but they ain't lifting a finger to help."
Matthew,23,5,"But, like, everything they do is just for show, you know? They're all about flexin' and trying to get attention from people. They make their wristbands and clothes all extra flashy, you feel me? (BTW, phylacteries are like those scrolls with rules and stuff)"
Matthew,23,6,"And be all about snagging the best spots at parties, and scoring the top spots in the cool hangout spots,"
Matthew,23,7,"And like, saying what's up to everyone in the markets, and wanting people to call you Rabbi, Rabbi."
Matthew,23,8,"But like, don't go around calling yourself 'Rabbi,' alright? 'Cause we all got one true Master, Jesus, you know? And we're all homies, no need for titles and stuff."
Matthew,23,9,"And don't go around calling anyone your 'daddy' here on earth because there's only one true Papa, and He's up in heaven."
Matthew,23,10,"Yo, don't go around callin' yourselves masters, bruh. 'Cause we all got one Master and that's Christ, ya dig?"
Matthew,23,11,"But the one who's like, totally amazing among you will be the ultimate squad servant."
Matthew,23,12,"Like, anyone who's all about self-promotion will totally be brought down, but those who are humble and down-to-earth will be lifted up, you know?"
Matthew,23,13,"But listen up, you scribes and Pharisees, fakers! You're blocking the way to heaven for people. And guess what? You're not even going in yourselves, and you're not letting others enter either."
Matthew,23,14,"Yo, scribes and Pharisees, fake peeps! You out here fronting like you all holy, but really you takin' advantage of widows, snatchin' up their homes. And don't even get me started on your super long prayers just for show. Y'all gonna get hit with some serious consequences, no doubt."
Matthew,23,15,"OMG, listen up, scribes and Pharisees! Seriously, y'all need to check yourselves. Like, you go to great lengths to convert people, traveling far and wide, but let me tell you, when you do convert someone, you end up turning them into a bigger mess than you are. It's like hell has got nothing on them anymore. SMH."
Matthew,23,16,"Too bad for you, blind leaders, who think it's no big deal to swear by the temple, but consider someone in debt if they swear by the gold of the temple!"
Matthew,23,17,"Yo, come on, you clueless fools! Like, seriously, think about it - what's more important, the bling or the sacred place that brings value to the bling?"
Matthew,23,18,"And, if anyone swears by the altar, it's no big deal; but if someone swears by the gift that's on it, they messed up. {messed up: or, owes, or, is in trouble}"
Matthew,23,19,"Yo, you fools and blind ones! Like seriously, which one's more important, the gift itself or the altar that makes the gift holy?"
Matthew,23,20,"So, like, if anyone swears by the altar, they're totally swearing by it and everything else on it."
Matthew,23,21,"If someone swears by the temple, they're basically swearing by the temple and the awesome power that lives inside it."
Matthew,23,22,"If someone swears by heaven, they're actually swearing by God's throne and the One who's sitting on it."
Matthew,23,23,"Dude, scribes and Pharisees, listen up! You guys are pretending to be all holy and religious, but you only care about following the rules about giving a tenth of your herbs and spices like mint, anise, and cummin. You're totally forgetting about the more important things, like being fair and just, showing kindness and compassion, and having faith. Don't ignore those important matters while still focusing on the other stuff, okay? Oh, by the way, anise means dill in Greek."
Matthew,23,24,"You blind influencers, always making a big deal out of little things while ignoring the obvious issues."
Matthew,23,25,"Bruh, listen up! I gotta call out those scribes and Pharisees, straight up fakers. They frontin' all pure and clean with their cups and plates on the outside, but on the inside, they be straight-up greedy and indulgent. Can't trust 'em, man!"
Matthew,23,26,"Yo, blind Pharisee, gotta start by cleaning up what's inside the cup and platter, so the outside looks fresh too."
Matthew,23,27,"You guys are in big trouble, scribes and Pharisees, fakers! You're like those Instagram filters that make everything look perfect on the surface, but inside you're straight-up full of decay and dirt."
Matthew,23,28,"Like, you guys might be all like putting on this exterior of righteousness in front of everyone, but deep down you're just full of hypocrisy and being all shady."
Matthew,23,29,"Damn, you scribes and Pharisees, you're such posers! You act all holy, but all you do is make fancy graves for the prophets and decorate the righteous people's tombs."
Matthew,23,30,"Yo, like, if we were chillin' in our ancestors' era, we totally wouldn't have been down with them when they straight up caused harm to the prophets, you know?"
Matthew,23,31,"So, like, you guys are basically confirming to yourselves that you're the offspring of those who totally did away with the prophets."
Matthew,23,32,"So, like, complete the whole deal, just like your old school ancestors."
Matthew,23,33,"You sneaky snakes, you brood of vipers, how do you expect to avoid the ultimate consequences of your actions?"
Matthew,23,34,"Yo, check this out: I'm sending you some awesome prophets, wise people, and scribes. But here's the deal - some of you are gonna straight up kill and crucify them. And others, you'll harshly punish in your synagogues and chase them down from city to city. It's about to get intense, y'all!"
Matthew,23,35,"Yo, you're about to be held accountable for all the innocent blood that has been spilled on this earth. Like, starting from the righteous blood of Abel, right up until the blood of Zacharias, the son of Barachias, who you guys straight up killed right between the temple and the altar."
Matthew,23,36,"Listen up, fam! I'm telling you straight up, all these things are gonna go down in this generation, for real."
Matthew,23,37,"Yo, Jerusalem, like, seriously, you keep killing the prophets and stoning the ones sent to you. How many times did I want to bring all your babies together, like when a mama hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you straight up refused!"
Matthew,23,38,"Yo, your crib's gonna be all empty and abandoned."
Matthew,23,39,"Listen up! I'm telling you, you won't see me again until you recognize and give props to the one who comes in the name of the Lord, okay?"
Matthew,24,1,"And Jesus left the temple, and his crew approached him to show off the sick architecture."
Matthew,24,2,"Yo, peeps! Check out all these things, seriously! I'm telling ya, not even one single stone is gonna be left on top of another. They're all gonna be thrown down, no joke."
Matthew,24,3,"And, like, Jesus was chillin' on the mount of Olives, when his disciples rolled up on him, all low-key, and asked him, 'Yo, when is all this gonna happen? And how will we know when you're comin' back and the world's about to end?'"
Matthew,24,4,"And Jesus was like, yo dudes, listen up! Make sure no one pulls a fast one on you, okay?"
Matthew,24,5,"Like, a bunch of people will come and be all like, 'Yo, I'm the Messiah,' and try to trick a whole lot of people."
Matthew,24,6,"And you'll start hearing about wars and rumors of wars: don't freak out though, 'cause it's all part of the plan, but the end isn't here yet."
Matthew,24,7,"Yo, it's gonna be crazy out there. Nations gonna be beefing with each other, kingdoms too. And listen up, there's gonna be shortages, diseases, and earthquakes popping off in different spots. Stay woke, fam."
Matthew,24,8,"These things, like, just the beginning of a whole lota pain and struggle."
Matthew,24,9,"So, like, people might totally try to mess with you and even take your life, all because of, like, me and what my name stands for. And, just saying, every nation out there is gonna hate you for it."
Matthew,24,10,"And then, like, so many people will get triggered, and they'll, like, totally backstab each other and spread hate all around."
Matthew,24,11,"Yo, there's gonna be a bunch of fake prophets poppin' up, tryna fool a whole lot of people."
Matthew,24,12,"And because there will be a lot of wrongdoing, many people's love will become less passionate."
Matthew,24,13,"But the one who keeps going till the very end, they'll be saved for real."
Matthew,24,14,"And this awesome message about the kingdom will be spread all over the world, making sure everyone knows about it; and when that happens, the end will come, no doubt."
Matthew,24,15,"Yo, when y'all peeps spot the super messed up stuff happening, you know, like how Daniel the prophet called it, go down in the sacred spot, whoever's reading this, make sure you really get what's going on, ya feel me?"
Matthew,24,16,"Yo, if you're in Judaea, better skedaddle to them mountains, ASAP!"
Matthew,24,17,"Yo, if you're up on the roof, don't bother coming down to grab anything from inside your crib."
Matthew,24,18,Don't even think about turning back to grab your fit when you're out in the field.
Matthew,24,19,"And oh man, it's gonna be rough for those who are pregnant or nursing during that time!"
Matthew,24,20,"But yo, make sure you pray that you don't have to dip during winter or on the sabbath, just sayin'."
Matthew,24,21,"It's gonna be one crazy ride, like nothing that's ever happened before or ever will again, a total rollercoaster of tribulation."
Matthew,24,22,"And if those days weren't cut short, no one would make it out alive. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened."
Matthew,24,23,"So, like, if any dude comes up to you and is like, 'Yo, check it out, Christ is over here' or 'Nah, bro, He's over there,' don't just blindly believe it, okay?"
Matthew,24,24,"So, like, there will be these fake Christs, fake prophets, and they'll be all about doing crazy good stuff and performing mind-blowing miracles. It's gonna be so intense that, if it were even possible, they would totally trick the most faithful peeps out there."
Matthew,24,25,"Yo, listen up, I've already dropped this knowledge on you."
Matthew,24,26,"So if someone tells you, like, 'Yo, he's chilling in the desert, don't bother going there, fam,' or 'Check it, he's hiding in some secret spot,' don't even fall for it, like, doubt that noise, man."
Matthew,24,27,"Just like when a lit TikTok trend spreads like wildfire from one side of the internet to the other, that's exactly how it's gonna be when the Son of man makes his entrance!"
Matthew,24,28,"Yo, wherever the dead body is, the eagles are gonna flock there."
Matthew,24,29,"Right after all the craziness goes down, the sun will go dark, the moon won't shine, and the stars will fall from the sky. It's gonna be a total shake-up in the heavens!"
Matthew,24,30,"And then this epic sign is gonna pop up in the sky, showing that the Son of man is totally here in heaven. And get this, all the tribes on Earth are gonna be mega sad and mourning, because they're gonna witness the Son of man cruising down on some heavenly clouds, bringing all his power and mind-blowing glory with him. It's gonna be legendary, fam!"
Matthew,24,31,"And yo, he gonna send his angels, blasting that sick trumpet sound, and they gonna rally up his squad from all over the place, from every corner of the sky. From start to finish, they gonna collect all his chosen ones. {with...: or, with a trumpet, and a great voice}"
Matthew,24,32,"Okay, check this out: here's a story about a fig tree. So, like, when its branches start becoming all soft and sprout leaves, that's a big clue that summer's right around the corner, you know?"
Matthew,24,33,"Yo, fam, listen up. When you peep all these signs, just know that it's about to go down, like right at the doorstep. Word."
Matthew,24,34,"Seriously, I'm telling y'all, this squad right here won't bounce until everything I just mentioned goes down."
Matthew,24,35,"Like, dude, the whole heaven and earth may totally vanish someday, but trust me, my words ain't gonna go anywhere, ya know?"
Matthew,24,36,"No cap, nobody knows when that day is gonna go down, not even the angel squad up in heaven, only my pops got the deets."
Matthew,24,37,"But just like how things were back in the days of Noe, that's exactly how it's gonna be when the Son of man comes."
Matthew,24,38,"Just like back in the days before the flood, people were chillin', grubbin' on food, pairing up and gettin' hitched, all the way up until Noah entered the ark."
Matthew,24,39,"And they didn't even see it coming before the flood happened and washed them all away. That's exactly how it's gonna be when the Son of Man shows up, too."
Matthew,24,40,"So like, there will be two people chilling in a field. And like, one of them will be taken away, and the other will be left behind."
Matthew,24,41,"There will be these two ladies grinding it out at the mill: one is gonna make it, while the other is gonna miss out."
Matthew,24,42,"Stay woke, cuz you never know when your Lord is gonna roll up."
Matthew,24,43,"Listen up, fam! If the owner of the house had any clue about when that sneaky thief was gonna show up, you best believe they would've been on high alert, keeping a keen eye out and making sure no one laid a finger on their crib."
Matthew,24,44,"So, like, be prepared too, 'cause you never know when the Son of man is gonna show up outta nowhere, when you least expect it, ya know?"
Matthew,24,45,"So, like, who's the ultimate loyal and smart homie, that his boss has put in charge of running his crew to serve them some rad food at the right time?"
Matthew,24,46,"Dude, that servant is totally blessed! When the boss arrives, he better catch that servant doing his thing."
Matthew,24,47,"I'm totally serious when I tell you, he's gonna make the guy in charge of everything he's got."
Matthew,24,48,"But if that wicked servant thinks to himself, like, yo, my boss is taking forever to show up;"
Matthew,24,49,"And when they start attacking their friends and partying excessively with the intoxicated,"
Matthew,24,50,"The boss of that servant is gonna show up unexpectedly, like totally catching him off guard, when he least expects it and has absolutely no clue, you know?"
Matthew,24,51,"And he will separate them and put them with the fakers, where there will be crying and grinding of teeth."
Matthew,25,1,"So, it's like this, the kingdom of heaven is basically similar to this situation where there were ten girls who were all waiting for this dude called the bridegroom to arrive. And to be prepared for his arrival, they took their lamps and headed out."
Matthew,25,2,"So like, five of them were actually smart and prepared, but the other five were kinda clueless and not so wise."
Matthew,25,3,"The dumb ones grabbed their flashlights, but forgot to bring any batteries with them:"
Matthew,25,4,"But the smart ones made sure to have extra oil in their stash, along with their lit lamps."
Matthew,25,5,"So, like, the groom took longer than expected, and guess what? They all ended up napping and sleeping."
Matthew,25,6,"Yo, it was midnight and suddenly, people start shouting like, 'Yo, the groom is coming! Go out and meet him!'"
Matthew,25,7,"So, like, all the single ladies got up and made their light-up things look fly."
Matthew,25,8,"And the dumb ones were like, 'Yo, could you hook us up with some of your oil? Our lights totally died.'"
Matthew,25,9,"But the woke ones replied, like, duh, that's not how it works; we all need to have enough. So, y'all should totally go to the store and buy for yourselves."
Matthew,25,10,"So, like, while they were off buying stuff, the bridegroom showed up, and those who were prepared to party went inside and joined him in the wedding ceremony. And then, bam, the door closed."
Matthew,25,11,"Then the other squad rolls up, like 'Yo, yo, Lord, open up for us, fam'."
Matthew,25,12,"But he replied and said, for real, I'm telling you, I don't even know who you are."
Matthew,25,13,"Stay woke, fam, 'cause you don't even know when the Son of man is gonna show up. Like, it could be any time, so be on your guard, okay?"
Matthew,25,14,"The kingdom of heaven is like when a dude goes on a trip to a super far-off place, and he hits up his squad, giving them all his stuff."
Matthew,25,15,"So, this guy gave five talents to one person, two talents to another, and one talent to someone else. He gave each person different amounts based on their abilities. Then he bounced and went on his journey."
Matthew,25,16,"So the person who was given the five talents went and used them wisely, and ended up doubling their worth, turning them into an additional five talents."
Matthew,25,17,"And the dude who got two, he also scored another two, ya feel me?"
Matthew,25,18,"But the one who got only one went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money there."
Matthew,25,19,"After, like, forever, the boss finally shows up and starts crunching numbers with his peeps."
Matthew,25,20,"Then the guy who was given five talents came and brought five more talents, like, yo, Lord, you gave me five talents, and check it, I made five more talents on top of that, no biggie."
Matthew,25,21,"His boss was like, 'Dude, great job! You've been such a loyal and reliable employee. You've been killing it with your responsibilities, so I'm gonna promote you to handle even more stuff. Come join in the happiness of your boss.'"
Matthew,25,22,"So, the one who got two talents came up to the boss and was like, 'Yo, dude, you gave me two talents, right? Well check it out, I just doubled that and made two more talents on top of it!'"
Matthew,25,23,"His boss was like, 'You totally nailed it, my loyal and reliable employee! You've been so dependable with small tasks, so now I'm gonna hook you up with even more responsibilities. Come on in and celebrate with your boss, it's gonna be lit!'"
Matthew,25,24,"So, like, the guy who got just one talent came up to the boss and was all, 'Yo, I know you're a tough one, always harvesting where you haven't even planted, and gathering where you haven't even spread any seeds, man.'"
Matthew,25,25,"So, like, I got scared and decided to bury your talent in the ground. And, um, here it is, all yours."
Matthew,25,26,"Yo, his boss snapped back at him like, 'Bro, you wicked and lazy servant! You knew I hustle hard and collect where I didn't even plant the seeds!'"
Matthew,25,27,"So, like, you should have invested my money with some finance dudes, and when I came back, I would've gotten back even more cash."
Matthew,25,28,"So like, take that talent away from him and give it to the person who already has ten talents."
Matthew,25,29,"Like, if you've got stuff, you'll get even more, and you'll be, like, loaded. But if you have nothing, it's gonna be ripped away from you."
Matthew,25,30,"And like, totally throw that unproductive servant into, like, outer darkness, you know? And there, it's gonna be absolute crying and teeth grinding, like, for real."
Matthew,25,31,"When the Son of man comes in his full glory, chillin' with all his holy angels, then he's gonna take a seat on his epic throne of glory."
Matthew,25,32,"And all the people from every nation will come before him, and he will divide them just like a shepherd separates his sheep from his goats."
Matthew,25,33,"Then he's gonna put the sheep on his right side, but the goats on the left, you know?"
Matthew,25,34,"So, like, the King, right? He's gonna be all like, 'Yo, dudes on my right side, come here! You guys are totally blessed by my Dad. He wants you to inherit this awesome kingdom that He's been preppin' for you since, like, forever ago, from the beginning of everything, man!"
Matthew,25,35,"So, like, I was starving, and you totally hooked me up with some food. I was parched, and you came through with a drink. And when I was a total stranger, you welcomed me with open arms."
Matthew,25,36,"Yo, when I was butt naked, you hooked me up with clothes. When I was sick, you rolled through to check on me. And when I was locked up, you came to chill with me."
Matthew,25,37,"And the ones who do good will reply to Him, like, 'Yo, Lord, when did we see You all hungry and hook You up with some grub? Or thirsty and quench Your thirst with a drink?'"
Matthew,25,38,"Bruh, when did we spot you as a random person and invite you into our squad? Or when did we see you in need of clothes and hook you up with some dope threads?"
Matthew,25,39,"Like, when did we like, see you sick or in prison or something and, like, come to you?"
Matthew,25,40,"And the King will be like, 'Listen up, you guys! I swear, if you've been showing kindness to the littlest people in my fam, you've actually been showing kindness to me.'"
Matthew,25,41,"And he'll be like, 'Yo, lefties, skrrt outta here! You're just bringing bad vibes. Head to the never-ending lit fire, specially made for the devil and his crew.'"
Matthew,25,42,"Dude, I was starving and you didn't even hook me up with some food. I was mad thirsty and you didn't bother to get me a drink. Like, seriously? 🙄"
Matthew,25,43,"I was, like, a total stranger and you didn't even give me a shoutout: I was completely lacking the drip, and you didn't hook me up with any fresh fits; I was low-key sick and locked up, and you didn't even slide into my DMs to show support."
Matthew,25,44,"And they're gonna be like, 'Yo, Lord, when did we see you all hungry or thirsty or like, a stranger in need, or naked, or sick, or locked up and not help you out, my bad?'"
Matthew,25,45,"And he'll be like, yo, listen up fam, for real, I'm telling you straight up, if you didn't show love to even the smallest people out there, you straight up didn't show love to me."
Matthew,25,46,And these people will be sent to an everlasting punishment: but the ones who did right will experience eternal life.
Matthew,26,1,"So, Jesus was wrapping up all his teachings and he turned to his squad and said,"
Matthew,26,2,"You all know that in two days it's time for the passover, and the Son of man is about to be betrayed and crucified."
Matthew,26,3,"So the top priests, the cool writers, and the OGs of the peeps got together and went to the high priest Caiaphas' crib,"
Matthew,26,4,"And they plotted to catch Jesus off guard and take him by stealth, with the intention to kill him."
Matthew,26,5,"But they were like, nah, not gonna do it during the festival, too risky with all the potential drama from the crowd."
Matthew,26,6,"So, like, Jesus was chilling in Bethany, at Simon the leper's crib,"
Matthew,26,7,"So this woman comes up to Jesus carrying this super expensive ointment in a really fancy alabaster box, and she just straight up pours it all over his head while he's chilling out and having a meal."
Matthew,26,8,"But when his homies peeped that, they were mad salty, like, why you gotta be wastin' like this, fam?"
Matthew,26,9,"Dude, this fancy ointment could've totally been sold for serious cash and used to help out the less fortunate peeps."
Matthew,26,10,"When Jesus got what was up, he said to them, 'Why you gotta bother the girl? She's done something good for me.'"
Matthew,26,11,"Just so you know, the poor are always gonna be around, but I won't be hanging out with you all the time, fam."
Matthew,26,12,"When she poured this ointment on me, she did it in preparation for my burial."
Matthew,26,13,"I'm telling you, wherever this good news gets shared all around the world, they'll also mention what this woman did to honor her forever."
Matthew,26,14,"So, like, one of the twelve homies, named Judas Iscariot, straight up rolls up to the chief priests,"
Matthew,26,15,"So he was like, 'Yo, what's in it for me if I hand him over to you guys?' And they were like, 'We'll give you 30 silver coins, deal or no deal?'"
Matthew,26,16,"And like, since then he was, like, looking for a chance to, like, totally betray him."
Matthew,26,17,"So, like, it was the first day of this really important feast called unleavened bread and the disciples rolled up to Jesus, being all like, 'Yo dude, where do you wanna chow down and have the passover meal?'"
Matthew,26,18,"So Jesus was like, 'Hey, go into town and find this dude, tell him the Boss says it's time for the Passover feast and we're gonna do it at his place with my homies.'"
Matthew,26,19,So the disciples did exactly what Jesus told them to do and prepared for the passover.
Matthew,26,20,"So, when it got late, he chilled and hung out with his squad of twelve."
Matthew,26,21,"Yo, while they were chowing down, he straight up said, 'For real, I'm telling you, one of y'all gonna betray me.'"
Matthew,26,22,"And they were like super sad, and each one of them started asking him, Lordd, could it be me?'"
Matthew,26,23,"And he was like, yo, whoever eats with me from the same dish is gonna betray me, fam."
Matthew,26,24,"The Son of man is heading out just like it was written, but dang, that dude who betrays the Son of man is in for some serious trouble! Let me tell you, it would've been way better for him if he had never been born."
Matthew,26,25,"So, like, Judas, the one who duped Him, was all like, 'Yo, teacher, is it me?' And then Jesus was like, 'Yeah, dude, you nailed it.'"
Matthew,26,26,"While they were chowing down, Jesus grabbed some bread, said a blessing, broke it, and handed it over to the squad, saying 'Here you go, dig in; this is my body.'"
Matthew,26,27,"And he grabbed the cup and was like, 'Yo, thanks!' and handed it to them, saying, 'Drink up, fam, all of it!'"
Matthew,26,28,"Yo, this is like my blood, the new deal, you know? It's spilled out for a bunch of peeps to help 'em get rid of their sins."
Matthew,26,29,"But yo, listen up, I ain't sippin' on this vine juice no more, till the day I sip it fresh with y'all in my Father's kingdom."
Matthew,26,30,"After they jammed out to a lit hymn, they bounced out to the mount of Olives. #GoodVibesOnly #PsalmOnFleek"
Matthew,26,31,"Jesus just straight up tells them, 'Yo, all of you gonna get offended by me tonight. It's all good though, 'cause it was already written that I'm gonna mess up the leader and the rest of the crew gonna scatter everywhere.'"
Matthew,26,32,"But once I've come back to life, I'll meet up with you in Galilee before anyone else."
Matthew,26,33,"Peter replied and was like, 'Even if all the homies start trippin' because of you, I won't ever be trippin'. Like, no matter what happens, my faith will be solid and on point.'"
Matthew,26,34,"Jesus was like, yo bro, listen up. I'm telling you straight up, tonight before the rooster starts doing its thing, you're gonna deny me three times. No cap."
Matthew,26,35,"Peter was like, 'Yo, even if I gotta die with you, I'm not gonna front on you.' And all the homies straight up agreed with him."
Matthew,26,36,"So Jesus rolls up with his homies to this spot called Gethsemane, and he's like, 'Yo, chill here while I go off and pray over there'."
Matthew,26,37,So he grabbed Peter and the two bros of Zebedee and started feeling so down and super bummed out.
Matthew,26,38,"So then, he walked a bit farther, dropped to the ground, and started praying. He said, 'Yo, Dad, if there's any chance, can you please take away this heavy situation from me? But hey, I trust your plan more than mine, so whatever you decide, I'm down with it, no matter what.'"
Matthew,26,39,"So he goes to his friends, and sees that they're all asleep. And he says to Peter, like, seriously? You couldn't stay awake and hang with me for just one hour?"
Matthew,26,40,"Keep your eyes peeled and stay alert so you don't fall into the traps: even though your mind wants to do the right thing, your body might not be up to the challenge."
Matthew,26,41,"He dipped outta there a second time and prayed, like, 'Yo, Dad, if I gotta drink this cup and can't dodge it, your will be done.'"
Matthew,26,42,"And then he walked over and saw them passed out once again, because they were so tired."
Matthew,26,43,"And he bounced out of there and dipped, then went off for another round of prayer, repeating the same words once more."
Matthew,26,44,"So, like, he goes to his homies and he's all like, 'Yo, take a nap and chillax now. Check it out, the time has come, and the Son of man is gonna be handed over to some sketchy peeps who love to sin.'"
Matthew,26,45,"Hey, let's bounce: guess who's here to stab me in the back?"
Matthew,26,46,"So, like, while Jesus was still talking, dude, Judas, one of his twelve homies, shows up, and he brought a huge group of guys armed with swords and stuff. And get this, they were all sent by the head priests and older peeps from the crowd."
Matthew,26,47,"So, like, the dude who turned on Jesus was all like, 'Hey, I'll give you a signal. The one I kiss is the guy you want. Grab him!'"
Matthew,26,48,"Then he quickly approached Jesus and said, 'Yo, what's up, master?' and gave him a high five."
Matthew,26,49,"And Jesus was like, dude, why are you here? And then his crew came over, grabbed Jesus, and took him away."
Matthew,26,50,"Yo, check it out! One of Jesus' homies straight up pulled out his sword and slashed a servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear."
Matthew,26,51,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Bro, put that sword away! 'Cause anyone who lives by the sword is gonna die by the sword, ya know? So, let's not resort to violence, alright? Peace out.'"
Matthew,26,52,"Do you seriously think I can't just ask my Dad to hook me up with, like, a whole squad of twelve legions of angels right now?"
Matthew,26,53,"But like, how are the scriptures gonna be, you know, fulfilled? Like, it's just gotta be that way, ya feel me?"
Matthew,26,54,"At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, 'Did you really have to come at me like I'm some kind of criminal, with all your weapons? I've been hanging out with you every day, teaching in the temple, and you didn't even try to catch me.'"
Matthew,26,55,"But that was all part of the plan, so that what the prophets said in the scriptures could come true. And just like that, all the disciples dipped out and ran away."
Matthew,26,56,"So, like, those dudes who grabbed Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where all the scribblers and old peeps were hanging out."
Matthew,26,57,"So Peter kind of stalked Jesus from a distance to the high priest's crib, then he went in and chilled with the servants, just to see how things would go down."
Matthew,26,58,"So, like, the main priests, old peeps, and the whole council were totally trying to find fake witnesses against Jesus, just to like, get rid of him for good."
Matthew,26,59,"But they couldn't find any: even though a bunch of fake witnesses showed up, they still found no one to testify. Eventually, two false witnesses came forward."
Matthew,26,60,"And like, this guy was all, 'Yo, I can totally wreck God's crib and rebuild it in just three days.'"
Matthew,26,61,"The high priest stood up and asked, 'Yo, are you gonna say anything? Like, what are these people accusing you of?'"
Matthew,26,62,"But Jesus stayed silent. And the high priest was like, 'Yo, I'm calling on the real divine power right now, tell us straight up, are you the chosen one, the Son of God?'"
Matthew,26,63,"Jesus be like, 'Oh, you said it! But listen up, here's what's gonna happen: in the future, you gonna witness the Son of man chilling on the ultimate throne, flexing the big power moves, and rolling up in some heavenly clouds."
Matthew,26,64,"And then the high priest was like, OMG he literally just said something offensive about God; like, seriously? Why do we even need more people to testify? You all just heard him disrespect God. SMH."
Matthew,26,65,"What do y'all think? They responded like, 'Yeah, he's totally gotta face the death penalty.'"
Matthew,26,66,"And they like totally spat in his face and like, started hitting him and others were like slapping him, you know, with their hands and stuff, like really hard, maybe even with rods, you know?"
Matthew,26,67,"They were like, 'Yo, predict the future for us, you supposed Messiah. Tell us, who's the one who messed you up?'"
Matthew,26,68,"So Peter was just chilling outside the palace when this girl comes up to him, saying like, 'Hey, you were with Jesus from Galilee too, right?'"
Matthew,26,69,"But he straight up denied it to everyone, like, I have no idea what you're even talking about."
Matthew,26,70,"And when he went out onto the porch, another girl saw him and said to the people there, 'Yo, this dude was also rollin' with Jesus of Nazareth.'"
Matthew,26,71,"And he totally swore again, like for real this time, and was like, 'Nah bruh, I don't even know that dude.'"
Matthew,26,72,"And then, a little later, some people nearby approached Peter and said, 'Dude, you're totally one of them too! Your way of talking gives you away.'"
Matthew,26,73,"Then he started swearing and cursing, like, 'I don't even know the dude!' And right away, the rooster started crowing."
Matthew,26,74,"And Peter was like, whoa, Jesus totally called this! He had told Peter that, before the rooster crows, he would deny Jesus three times. And guess what? It happened exactly like Jesus said. Peter was so bummed, he left and just cried his heart out."
Matthew,27,1,"When morning came, all the big-shot priests and older folks got together to plan how they could kill Jesus:"
Matthew,27,2,"And when they tied him up, they took him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the ruler dude."
Matthew,27,3,"So, like, Judas, who totally betrayed Him, when he realized that Jesus was being condemned, he felt, like, super guilty and gave back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders."
Matthew,27,4,"Like, I was totally wrong, man. I totally screwed up by betraying an innocent person. And they were like, 'Why should we even care about that? It's your problem, dude.'"
Matthew,27,5,"Then he threw the money on the ground and left the temple. Feeling hopeless, he tragically ended his own life."
Matthew,27,6,"So, like, the high priests took the cash and were like, 'Um, we can't just throw this in the treasury, yo, 'cause it's, like, blood money and that's totally not cool.'"
Matthew,27,7,"So they were like, 'Let's plan this out,' and then they got together and got themselves the potter's field to use as a burial place for random people."
Matthew,27,8,"And so, that field was named 'The Blood Field' up until now."
Matthew,27,9,"Yo, Jeremiah the prophet straight up predicted this, saying that they snagged thirty pieces of silver, the dough they valued Jesus at, as valued by the folks from Israel. (Or, you know, they straight up bought him from the peeps of Israel.)"
Matthew,27,10,"And I got them for the potter's field, just like the Lord told me to."
Matthew,27,11,"So, Jesus was standing in front of the governor, and the governor was all like, 'Are you the King of the Jews, bro?' And Jesus was like, 'Yeah, you said it, man.'"
Matthew,27,12,"So, like, when the top priests and older peeps accused him, he didn't even bother to say anything, dude."
Matthew,27,13,"Pilate was like, 'Yo, don't you hear all the stuff these people are accusing you of?'"
Matthew,27,14,"And he, like, didn't say anything in response; it totally made the governor super shocked."
Matthew,27,15,"So, during that festival, the governor had this tradition of letting the people choose one prisoner to set free."
Matthew,27,16,"And they had this really popular prisoner, named Barabbas."
Matthew,27,17,"So, like, when everyone was, you know, hanging out together, Pilate straight-up goes to them and asks, 'Yo, who do you wanna set free? Barabbas or Jesus, aka the Christ?'"
Matthew,27,18,"He knew they were just hatin' when they betrayed him, ya feel me?"
Matthew,27,19,"Once he took his seat on the judgment throne, his wife messaged him, saying, 'Don't even think about messing with that righteous dude. I went through some seriously messed up things in a dream today because of him.'"
Matthew,27,20,"So, like, the main priests and elders, they totally convinced everyone to be all like, 'We should ask for Barabbas and, like, totally get rid of Jesus.'"
Matthew,27,21,"The governor was like, 'Yo, peeps, which one of these dudes do you want me to set free? They were like, 'Barabbas.'"
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate asked them, like, what should I do with this Jesus dude, who's like, called Christ? And they all replied, let him be crucified, man."
Matthew,27,23,"The governor was all like, 'Bro, why? What bad thing did this dude do?' But the crowd kept yelling louder, like, 'Nah man, let's totally crucify him!'"
Matthew,27,24,"When Pilate realized that he couldn't win this battle and that things were getting out of control, he grabbed some water and washed his hands in front of everyone. He said, 'I'm not responsible for the death of this innocent person, that's on you guys.'"
Matthew,27,25,"And everyone, like, totally responded and was like, 'Yeah, the blame is totally on us and our squad, all the way down to the next gen, no cap.'"
Matthew,27,26,"So he let Barabbas go and after whipping Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified."
Matthew,27,27,"So, like, the governor's soldiers brought Jesus into this chill hangout spot, and all the other soldiers joined them there. Just, you know, the governor's house, no biggie."
Matthew,27,28,And they took off his clothes and dressed him in a fire emoji outfit. 🧥
Matthew,27,29,"And they made this really messed up crown made of thorns and straight up put it on his head. Then they gave him a stick in his right hand, and they got down on their knees in a mocking way. They were like, 'Yo, what's up, King of the Jewish peeps!'"
Matthew,27,30,"And they like totally spat on him, and grabbed this stick thing, and like hit him on the head."
Matthew,27,31,"And after they had made fun of him, they removed the swaggy outfit and put his own clothes back on him, then brought him to get nailed on the cross."
Matthew,27,32,"As they were leaving, they bumped into this dude named Simon from Cyrene. And guess what? They totally made him carry Jesus' cross!"
Matthew,27,33,"And when they arrived at this spot called Golgotha, which means a place of a skull,"
Matthew,27,34,"They gave him this super gross drink with vinegar and gall mixed together, but when he tasted it, he was like, 'No way, not gonna drink that!'."
Matthew,27,35,"So, they totally crucified him and like, they split up his clothes and played a game of chance to decide who gets what. It's crazy 'cause this actually fulfills what the prophet said, you know? It's like, 'They split my clothes among themselves and cast lots for my robe.'"
Matthew,27,36,"And like, they just sat there, keeping an eye on him, ya know?"
Matthew,27,37,"And they put a sign above him that said, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Matthew,27,38,"So, like, there were these two thieves getting nailed on crosses with Jesus, one on his right and the other on his left."
Matthew,27,39,"And the people who walked by started dissing him, shaking their heads,"
Matthew,27,40,"They were like, 'Oh, look at you, Mr. Temple-wrecker, boasting about rebuilding it in three days. Prove yourself, if you're really the Son of God, hop off that cross.'"
Matthew,27,41,"And then all the big shots, like the high priests, scribes, and old folks, started making fun of Him, and this is what they said,"
Matthew,27,42,"Yo, he always be helping others, but he ain't saving himself. If he really the King of Israel, let him come down from that cross right now, and then we'll actually believe in him."
Matthew,27,43,"He was really relying on God; let's see if God saves him now. He kept saying he's God's Son, so let's see if that's true."
Matthew,27,44,The other homies who were getting nailed up with him were throwing shade at him too.
Matthew,27,45,"So, like, from noon until 3pm, the whole land was, like, completely covered in darkness."
Matthew,27,46,"At around 3pm, Jesus shouted out loudly, 'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' which means, 'My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?'"
Matthew,27,47,"Yo, when certain peeps over there heard that, they were like, 'This dude is calling for Elias!'"
Matthew,27,48,"And like, immediately one of them was like, 'OMG gotta help!' So they grabbed a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to like, drink."
Matthew,27,49,"The others were like, 'Chill, let's wait and see if Elias swoops in to rescue him.'"
Matthew,27,50,"Bruh, Jesus, like, shouted out once more in a mega loud voice, then straight up gave up his spirit."
Matthew,27,51,"Yo, check it out, the chill temple curtain got split in two, from the top all the way to the bottom. Earth started shaking, rocks were like, 'Hiyah!'"
Matthew,27,52,"And like, dude, the graves were like, totally opened, and a bunch of dead saints like woke up and stuff, you know?"
Matthew,27,53,"And like, after Jesus rose from the dead, a bunch of people who had been dead also rose up and came into the city, and a whole bunch of people saw them and stuff."
Matthew,27,54,"So like, this centurion dude and his peeps, they were keeping an eye on Jesus, right? And then boom! They see this crazy earthquake go down and witness all the crazy stuff that's happening. And man, they were totally shooketh! They're like, Holyy moly, no doubt about it, this dude is straight up the Son of God!'"
Matthew,27,55,"There were so many dope ladies there, watching from a distance, who were down with Jesus and had his back since he was doing his thing in Galilee, supporting him and serving him:"
Matthew,27,56,"The squad included Mary Magdalene, Mary (James and Joses' mom), and the mom of Zebedee's kids."
Matthew,27,57,"As the sun started setting, this wealthy dude named Joseph from Arimathaea came through. He was a true blue follower of Jesus too, no cap."
Matthew,27,58,He went up to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate then ordered that the body be handed over.
Matthew,27,59,"So, like, Joseph grabbed the body and swathed it in, like, a fresh, clean linen cloth, ya know?"
Matthew,27,60,"Then he put it in his brand-new tomb that he had carved into the rock. Afterwards, he rolled a huge stone in front of the tomb's entrance and left."
Matthew,27,61,"And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, chilling right across from the tomb."
Matthew,27,62,"So the day after they got everything ready, the top religious guys and Pharisees rolled up on Pilate like..."
Matthew,27,63,"Yo, dude, like, we totally remember that fake dude saying, when he was still alive, that he would like, come back after three days."
Matthew,27,64,"Yo, make sure that tomb is mega secure for three days straight, just to prevent his squad from sneaking in at night, swiping his body, and spreading the word that he's risen from the dead. Trust me, that would cause more chaos than before."
Matthew,27,65,"Pilate told them, 'You guys got this under control: go ahead, do your thing and make sure it's as tight as you can.'"
Matthew,27,66,"So they went and like, totally secured the tomb, sealed the stone, and had a watch in place."
Matthew,28,1,"When the sabbath was over, early in the morning on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to check out the tomb."
Matthew,28,2,"Yo, check it out, there was this insane earthquake: 'cause the angel of the Lord straight up came down from heaven, rolled back that huge stone at the entrance, and chillaxed on it."
Matthew,28,3,"Yo, this dude's face was lit up like a lightning bolt, and his outfit was straight fire, all white like fresh snow:"
Matthew,28,4,"And like, the guards were totally freaking out because of him, and they, like, froze up and became stiff as dead people or whatever."
Matthew,28,5,"And the angel was like, 'Yo, don't be scared, okay? I know you're looking for Jesus, the one who got nailed on the cross.'"
Matthew,28,6,"Yo, he's not here anymore: he's risen, exactly like he said. Come check out where the Lord was chillin'."
Matthew,28,7,"Yo, hurry up and go spread the word to his squad that he's back from the dead. And check it, he's gonna meet up with y'all in Galilee. That's where you'll see him, no cap. I just gave you the heads up, fam."
Matthew,28,8,"And they quickly dipped out from the tomb, freaking out and hella stoked; and they sprinted to spread the news to his squad."
Matthew,28,9,"So, like, while they were on their way to inform his disciples, Jesus comes up to them and is like, 'Sup!'. And they, like, totally go over to him and grab onto his feet, showing mad respect and reverence."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Jesus was like, 'Don't even stress, fam: go tell my crew to meet me in Galilee, that's where we'll kick it."
Matthew,28,11,"So, like, when they were heading out, some of the security peeps went to the city and spilled all the deets to the big shot priests about everything that went down."
Matthew,28,12,"So, like, when they all got together with the older dudes and discussed things, they hooked up the soldiers with a fat stack of cash,"
Matthew,28,13,"So, like, they're saying that his followers, right, came at night and, while we were totally knocked out, they straight up stole him."
Matthew,28,14,"And if the governor finds out about this, we'll totally convince him and make sure you're safe, no cap."
Matthew,28,15,So they snagged the cash and followed the instructions like a pro. And word on the street is that this gossip is still making its rounds among the Jews nowadays.
Matthew,28,16,"So, like, after everything went down, the eleven homies that roll with Jesus hit up Galilee and went to the spot where Jesus told them to meet."
Matthew,28,17,"And when they peeped him, they totally respected him: but some were like, eh, not sure."
Matthew,28,18,"And Jesus popped up and started talking to them, like, 'Listen up fam, just so you know, I've got all the power in heaven and earth, ya feel me? Like, it's all been handed over to me, no cap."
Matthew,28,19,"So, like, go out there and spread the word to everyone, man. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, ya know?"
Matthew,28,20,"Telling them to follow all the things I've told you: and hey, I'll be with you always, even until the world goes kaput. Amen."
Mark,1,1,"Yo, listen up fam, this is where it all started - the gospel of Jesus Christ, straight up the Son of God;"
Mark,1,2,"Like, it's written in the prophets, check it out, I'm sending my messenger ahead of you, he's gonna get everything ready for you before you even arrive."
Mark,1,3,"Yo, listen up! There's this dude in the middle of nowhere shouting to get ready for the arrival of the Lord. He's like, 'Yo, make way for the Lord and smooth out his path.'"
Mark,1,4,"Yo, John was out in the middle of nowhere, doing some baptizing and preaching about getting cleansed from your sins. Like, he was all about that repentance, ya know? Bringing that forgiveness of sins vibes."
Mark,1,5,"And like, all the people from Judaea and Jerusalem totally flocked to him and got baptized by him in the Jordan River, fully admitting their wrongdoings."
Mark,1,6,"So, John was rocking a sick outfit made of camel's hair, and he had a dope belt made of animal skin around his waist. And get this, he was chowing down on locusts and wild honey, like some unconventional snack vibes going on."
Mark,1,7,"And I was like, yo, listen up everybody! Just so you know, there's gonna be someone even more lit than me coming up next. I mean, I don't even deserve to mess with his shoe game, like I'm not even on that level to unlace his kicks, you feel me?"
Mark,1,8,"Yeah, I've gotta say I've been doing the whole water baptism thing, but get ready 'cause there's something way more intense coming your way. He's gonna hook you up with a Holy Ghost baptism, like next level stuff, you know?"
Mark,1,9,"So, back in the day, Jesus rolls up straight outta Nazareth in Galilee and gets baptized by John in the Jordan River."
Mark,1,10,"As soon as he got out of the water, he saw the heavens crack wide open, and the Spirit came down on him like a dove: {opened: or, split, or, torn apart}"
Mark,1,11,"Then a voice came from the heavens, like, 'Dude, you're totally my beloved Son, and I'm so stoked with you.'"
Mark,1,12,"And right away, the Holy Spirit takes him to the middle of nowhere."
Mark,1,13,"So, like, Jesus was chillin' in the wilderness for like, 40 days, and then Satan comes along to try and mess with him. And brace yourself, bro, 'cause there were even wild beasts hangin' around! But don't stress, dude, 'cause the angels were there, too, takin' care of Jesus and stuff."
Mark,1,14,"So, like, once John got locked up, Jesus rolled into Galilee, spreading the good news about God's kingdom,"
Mark,1,15,"Yo, listen up! It's go time. The kingdom of God is about to pop off, so it's time to change your ways and embrace the good news."
Mark,1,16,"So, like, Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, when he spotted Simon and Andrew, bros who were out there casting a net into the sea 'cause they were legit fishers."
Mark,1,17,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Yo, follow me and I'll transform y'all into epic human influencers.'"
Mark,1,18,"And like, immediately they ditched their nets, and started vibing with him."
Mark,1,19,"And like, when he went a bit further, he spotted James, the son of Zebedee, and his bro, John, who were totally in the ship fixing their nets."
Mark,1,20,"Then he immediately beckoned them over, and they left their dad, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired help, and followed him."
Mark,1,21,"So they rolled up into Capernaum, and on the Sabbath day, Jesus walked right into the synagogue and started spitting straight facts."
Mark,1,22,"And they were shook by his teaching, 'cause he dropped knowledge like a boss, not all boring and traditional like the religious peeps."
Mark,1,23,"So, like, there was this guy at the synagogue who had, like, a really bad spirit inside him, and he started screaming,"
Mark,1,24,"They were like, 'Leave us alone, Jesus of Nazareth! What do we have to do with you? Are you here to wreck us? I totally recognize you, you're the Holy One of God.'"
Mark,1,25,"And Jesus was like, bro, chill out and leave him alone."
Mark,1,26,"And like, this totally wicked spirit was like tearing him apart, and then it like screamed super loudly and bounced out of him."
Mark,1,27,"And everyone was totally shook, like seriously questioning each other, like, What is happening here? What new vibes is this? Like, this dude has such mad authority that even the evil spirits obey him."
Mark,1,28,"And like, word got out super fast about this dude in Galilee. Everyone around there was talking about him, no cap."
Mark,1,29,"And right after they finished up at the synagogue, they headed over to Simon and Andrew's crib, along with James and John."
Mark,1,30,"So, basically, Simon's mother-in-law was really sick with a fever and they immediately let him know about it."
Mark,1,31,"Then he came and held her hand, lifting her up; instantly her fever disappeared, and she started serving them."
Mark,1,32,"And at the end of the day, when the sun went down, they brought to him anyone who was sick or struggling with inner demons."
Mark,1,33,"And, like, everyone in the whole city was, like, totally chilling out at the door."
Mark,1,34,"And he like, totally made a bunch of sick people better, you know, those peeps with all sorts of different diseases. Also, he straight up kicked out a bunch of devils. And not gonna lie, he shut those devils up real quick because they recognized him and he wasn't about that. Like, nah, no talking for you, demons!"
Mark,1,35,"Early in the morning, way before the sun was up, he bounced outta there and headed to a chill spot all by himself to have a super deep prayer sesh."
Mark,1,36,So Simon and his crew straight up chased after him.
Mark,1,37,"And when they finally tracked him down, they were like, 'Dude, everyone is looking for you!'"
Mark,1,38,"And he was like, yo guys, let's hit up the nearby towns so I can spread my message there too- like that's the whole reason I'm here, you know?"
Mark,1,39,"So, like, Jesus went around preaching in all the synagogues in Galilee and totally casting out demons."
Mark,1,40,"So, there was this leper who went up to Jesus, totally desperate and went down on his knees, and said to Jesus, 'If you're down for it, you have the power to heal me and make me clean.'"
Mark,1,41,"And Jesus, feeling so much empathy, reached out his hand and touched the person, saying to them, 'I got you, man; be healed.'"
Mark,1,42,"And like, the second he said it, boom, the leprosy was gone and he was totally healed."
Mark,1,43,"And he like, seriously told the guy, and immediately sent him off;"
Mark,1,44,"And he's like, yo don't tell anyone about this, just bounce and show yourself to the priest. Do all the cleansing stuff Moses told you to do, you know, for them to have proof and stuff."
Mark,1,45,"But he dipped out and straight flexed, spreading the word big time, so much so that Jesus couldn't even slide into the city without getting mobbed. He had to chill out in the wilderness, but people still came to him from all over the place."
Mark,2,1,"And then he went back to Capernaum after a while, and word got out that he was at someone's crib."
Mark,2,2,"And, like, so many people were like, totally gathered together that there was, like, literally no space to even get near the door. And then he, like, started preaching the word to them."
Mark,2,3,"So, like, these peeps roll up to him, carrying this one dude who's totally paralyzed, and it takes four of them to carry him."
Mark,2,4,"And when they couldn't get close to him because of the crowd, they went above and beyond by uncovering the roof where he was. They took action and broke it open so they could lower down the bed with the paralyzed person on it."
Mark,2,5,"When Jesus peeped their lit faith, he was like, 'Yo, homie with the palsy, I gotchu. Your sins are forgiven, bro'."
Mark,2,6,"So like, there were these scribes just chillin' and having deep thoughts in their minds,"
Mark,2,7,"Why is this guy saying such disrespectful stuff? Only God can forgive sins, duh!"
Mark,2,8,"And like, right away when Jesus sensed that they were like, totally deep in thought, he straight up told them, 'Yo, why are you guys overthinking this in your hearts?'"
Mark,2,9,"Like, which is, like, easier to say, suppose, to somebody who's like really sick, 'Dude, your sins are totally forgiven' or to be like, 'Yo, get up, grab your bed, and start walking'?"
Mark,2,10,"So, like, just to put it out there, you all should know that the Son of man totally has the power to forgive sins on earth, alright? He straight up said it to the sick person with palsy, you know?"
Mark,2,11,"Yo, listen up fam, get up off that bed, grab it, and bounce all the way to your crib."
Mark,2,12,"Then right away he got up, grabbed his bed, and walked out in front of everyone. They were all shook and praised God, saying, 'Yo, we've never seen anything like this before!'"
Mark,2,13,"So he headed back to the beach, and a whole bunch of people gathered around him. He started dropping some wisdom on them, teaching them cool stuff."
Mark,2,14,"And like, as he walked by, he totally spotted Levi, Alphaeus' kid, just chilling at the custom spot. And he was all like, 'Yo, come follow me.' And Levi was like, 'Bet.' So he got up and started following him. (*at the...: or, like, at the place where the custom was received*)"
Mark,2,15,"So, Jesus was just chilling at his crib, having a meal with his squad, and guess who showed up? Yeah, you heard me right. A whole bunch of tax collectors and notorious sinners were kickin' it with Jesus and his crew. Like, there were so many of them, and they were all about that Jesus life."
Mark,2,16,"And when the scribes and Pharisees peeped him chilling with tax collectors and sinners, they went up to his crew like, 'Yo, how come he's eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?'"
Mark,2,17,"When Jesus heard that, he was like: 'Listen up, y'all. Healthy folks don't need no doctor, it's the sick ones who do. I didn't come here to hang with the perfect ones, but to help the sinners get back on track.'"
Mark,2,18,"Yo, so the homies from John's crew and them Pharisees used to go on fasting mode. They roll up on Jesus and straight up ask him, 'Yo, why is it that John's disciples and them Pharisees be fasting, but your squad don't?'"
Mark,2,19,"And Jesus was like, yo listen up, can the squad chill and not eat, when the ultimate hype is right here with them? As long as they got that ultimate hype with them, there's no way they gonna be fasting, man."
Mark,2,20,"But there will come a time when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast during those days."
Mark,2,21,"No one sews a fresh outfit patch on an old clothes— otherwise, the new patch shrinks and makes the hole even bigger. {fresh outfit patch: or you know, unused fabric}"
Mark,2,22,"Yo, you don't pour that new juice into old containers, or else it'll straight up wreck 'em and you'll lose all that good stuff. Nah, the new juice needs fresh containers, you feel? No old school vibes here, only new territory for this new juice."
Mark,2,23,"So basically, Jesus was walking through some corn fields on the sabbath day. And his crew, you know, his disciples, started grabbing some corn as they were walking."
Mark,2,24,"So the Pharisees were like, yo, why are they doing something against the rules on the sabbath day?"
Mark,2,25,"So he's like, 'Bruh, y'all never even read what David did when he was starving and in need, along with his homies? Like, come on!'"
Mark,2,26,"So this dude, right, he totally rolls up to the house of God when Abiathar was high priest. And get this, he straight up munches on the shewbread, even though it's like off-limits for anyone but the priests. And you know what? He passes it on to his crew too, like it's all good!"
Mark,2,27,"Yo, listen up fam. The Sabbath was legit made for us humans, not the other way around."
Mark,2,28,"So, like, the Son of man is totally the boss of the sabbath, you know."
Mark,3,1,"So, Jesus went back to the synagogue, and guess who he found there? This dude with a totally messed up hand."
Mark,3,2,"So, like, they were totally keeping an eye on him, wondering if he would actually heal someone on the sabbath day just to find a way to accuse him. Can you believe it?"
Mark,3,3,"Then he tells the dude with the shriveled hand, 'Yo, step up front.' {Step up front: Like, get up, stand out in the crowd}"
Mark,3,4,"And he's like, yo, is it cool to do good stuff on the sabbath days or do bad stuff? Like, saving lives or hurting people? But the crowd was just silent, man."
Mark,3,5,"And when he checked out the situation and saw how angry and disappointed he was with their stubbornness and lack of compassion, he told the man, 'Yo dude, stretch out your hand.' And without hesitating, the man stretched it out and his hand became healed, just like the other one. (Hardness can also mean blindness, btw.)"
Mark,3,6,"So, like, the Pharisees were totally triggered, and, like, immediately started planning with the Herodians on how to totally cancel him."
Mark,3,7,"So Jesus and his squad dipped to the beach: and a massive crew from Galilee started trailing him, along with homies from Judaea,"
Mark,3,8,"So, word spread from all over - Jerusalem, Idumaea, even beyond Jordan. People from Tyre and Sidon, a massive crowd, heard about all the amazing things he was doing, and they flocked to him."
Mark,3,9,Then he told his squad to have a litt boat on standby 'cause the crowd was gettin' too wild and he didn't wanna get mobbed.
Mark,3,10,"So many people wanted to get close to him because he had healed a bunch of them. They were practically rushing towards him, just hoping to touch him, especially those who were dealing with diseases."
Mark,3,11,"And like, these evil spirits, they saw him and like, totally bowed down in front of him and were like, 'Yo, you're the Son of God!'"
Mark,3,12,"And he was like, 'Yo, don't go around telling everyone about me.'"
Mark,3,13,"So he goes up this mountain, and he's like, 'Yo, come here, whoever wants to chill with me.' And people actually go and hang out with him."
Mark,3,14,"And he picked twelve homies, so they could chill with him, and then he could send them out to spread the word,"
Mark,3,15,"And to be able to flex on curing illnesses, and yeet away them demons:"
Mark,3,16,"And Simon, like, gave Peter a cool new nickname;"
Mark,3,17,"Yo, it's James, Zebedee's kid, and John, James' broski. Jesus even gave them a dope nickname - Boanerges, which means the Sons of Thunder."
Mark,3,18,"So, we've got Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (the son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite, all just chillin' together."
Mark,3,19,"And Judas Iscariot, who also sold him out: and they went to a crib."
Mark,3,20,"And then a huge crowd gathered again, so busy that they barely had time to grab a bite."
Mark,3,21,"And when his squad heard about it, they rolled up to grab him because they were like, he's tripping. (squad: or, fam)"
Mark,3,22,"So, like, the scribes from Jerusalem were saying, 'Hey, this dude's using Beelzebub, the big boss of devils, to kick out other devils.'"
Mark,3,23,"And he called them over, and started telling them a story, like with all those TikTok trends, you know? He was like, 'Yo, how is Satan gonna be casting out Satan and stuff? Like, that just doesn't make sense, right?'"
Mark,3,24,"And yo, if a kingdom starts beefin' with itself, that kingdom ain't gonna make it."
Mark,3,25,"Yo, if a squad's all about inner drama and conflicts, that squad ain't gonna last."
Mark,3,26,"Yo, if Satan starts beefin' with himself and becomes all divided, he ain't gonna last, man. He's gonna crumble and fade away."
Mark,3,27,"No one can just walk into a tough guy's crib and jack his stuff, unless they tie up the tough guy first; then they can swipe all his gear."
Mark,3,28,"Seriously, listen up! I gotta tell you something important. Like, all sins can totally be forgiven for everyone, like no exceptions, bro! And uh, if anyone goes and says some blasphemous stuff, no worries, forgiveness got ya covered!"
Mark,3,29,But anyone who disrespects the Holy Ghost will never find forgiveness and will be at risk of eternal punishment:
Mark,3,30,"They were like, 'Dude, his spirit is totally jacked up.'"
Mark,3,31,"Then his siblings and his mom showed up, and they were outside. They sent a message to him, asking him to come out."
Mark,3,32,"And the squad was chillin' with him, and they were like, 'Yo, your fam outside lookin' for you, bro.'"
Mark,3,33,"And he was like, yo, he answered them and was like, 'Who's my fam, like my biological fam or my crew?'"
Mark,3,34,"Then he scanned the squad around him and said, 'Yo, check it out! These people right here are my squad fam!'"
Mark,3,35,"Anyone who does what God wants is like fam to me, y'know? They're my bros, my sis, my ride or die."
Mark,4,1,"So, he started dropping knowledge bombs by the beach, and a huge crowd gathered around him. It was so packed that he had to hop onto a boat and chill in the water while the whole crowd gathered on the shore."
Mark,4,2,"So, he dropped mad knowledge on them with some sick stories and started preaching his truth, yo"
Mark,4,3,"Yo, listen up! Check it, there was this person who went out to plant some seeds:"
Mark,4,4,"Yo, so this dude was out there sowing seeds, right? But some of those seeds fell on the path and, like, these birds swooped in and straight up gobbled 'em all up."
Mark,4,5,"And some landed on solid ground, where the soil was shallow, so it quickly grew, but couldn't go very deep because the ground was too hard:"
Mark,4,6,"But once the sun hit, it totally roasted it; and since it didn't have any strong foundation, it completely shriveled up."
Mark,4,7,"But like, some of the seeds landed in this thorny area, and these thorny plants grew up and basically strangled the seeds, so they couldn't bear any fruit or anything."
Mark,4,8,"Then, like, some of the seeds fell on dope soil, right? And they totally grew into fruitful plants that like, shot up and multiplied. They produced, like, thirty or sixty or even, like, a hundred times more, man."
Mark,4,9,"And he was like, yo fam, if you got ears, then like, actually listen."
Mark,4,10,"And yo, when he was doin' his own thing, the homies rollin' with him, all twelve of 'em, asked him 'bout the story he was tellin'."
Mark,4,11,"And he was like, 'Guys, you're totally in the know about the secrets of the Kingdom of God. But, for those outsiders, everything's being dropped in parables.'"
Mark,4,12,"So that when people see, they sort of see but don't really get it, and when they hear, they kind of hear but don't fully understand. Otherwise, they might actually get it and have their mistakes forgiven."
Mark,4,13,"And he was like, yo, don't you guys get this story? Like, if you can't even understand this one, how you gonna understand all the other stories I drop?"
Mark,4,14,The person planting seeds spreads the message.
Mark,4,15,"So, like, there are these people, right? They're like on the side, just chillin'. And then the word is dropped on them, you know? But as soon as they hear it, like, Satan swoops in, super fast, and snatches away the word that was dropped into their hearts."
Mark,4,16,"And these are the ones who are like planting seeds on rocky ground; when they hear the message, they instantly vibe with it and feel stoked about it;"
Mark,4,17,"They're like plants without deep roots, so they only last for a while. When troubles or haters come because of what they believe, they get all offended right away and stumble."
Mark,4,18,"And these are the ones who get caught up in distractions and social pressures; those who actually listen to what's being said,"
Mark,4,19,"So there's this thing, right? The concerns of this world, the trickery of money, and the intense cravings for other things sneak in and suffocate the message, making it unproductive. {lusts: or, excessive desires}"
Mark,4,20,"And these are the ones who are planted in good soil; those who listen to the message, accept it, and produce fruit—some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold."
Mark,4,21,"He was like, yo, why would you bring a candle just to hide it under a basket or a bed? It's meant to be put on a freaking candle holder, duh! (P.S. bushel means a smaller measurement, FYI)"
Mark,4,22,"Yo, nothing stays hidden forever, everything's gonna get revealed eventually. Ain't no secrets meant to stay quiet, they're bound to spread far and wide."
Mark,4,23,"Yo, if anyone out there has ears, then actually, like, use 'em and listen up."
Mark,4,24,"Yo, listen up fam! Pay attention to what you hear, 'cause whatever you dish out to others, that's what's gonna come back to you. And peeps who really listen and take it in, they're gonna get even more, aight?"
Mark,4,25,"If you've got it, you'll get even more. But if you don't, you'll lose whatever you have left."
Mark,4,26,"And he was like, yo, the kingdom of God is lit, it's like when someone drops some mad seeds into the ground, you know?"
Mark,4,27,"And like, you know, when you're sleeping and then suddenly it's morning, and then it's night again? And then, boom! The plants are just growing all on their own, like, magically. And, like, we don't even know how it happens, man."
Mark,4,28,"Yo, the earth does its thing and produces fruit on its own. First, you got the sprout, then the bud, and finally, the fully grown corn in the husk."
Mark,4,29,"But as soon as the fruit pops up, he's ready to gather it because it's harvest time. {pops up...: or, gets ripe}"
Mark,4,30,"Yo, check it. He was like, how can we even describe the kingdom of God? Like, what can we compare it to?"
Mark,4,31,"Imagine a tiny mustard seed, smaller than any other seed you can think of, being planted in the ground:"
Mark,4,32,"But, like, when it's all planted and stuff, it starts growing, and it becomes, like, way bigger than all the other plants, and it sprouts these massive branches, you know? So, like, birds can totally chill and find shade under it, up in the sky."
Mark,4,33,"And Jesus told them many stories like this, speaking to them in a way they could understand."
Mark,4,34,"But, like, Jesus only spoke to them using stories, you know? And when they were alone, he explained everything to his disciples. Pretty cool, right?"
Mark,4,35,"So, when it got late in the day, Jesus was like, 'Yo, let's cruise to the other side.'"
Mark,4,36,"And after they dismissed the crowd, they hopped on the boat with Jesus just the way he was. And there were a few other small boats cruising along with them too."
Mark,4,37,"So, like, this huge storm came out of nowhere, with crazy strong winds and these massive waves crashing into the ship, like, the ship was totally getting filled up and stuff."
Mark,4,38,"And he was chillin' in the back of the boat, knocked out on a comfy pillow: and his homies woke him up like, 'Bro, don't you even care if we totally go down?'"
Mark,4,39,"Then he got up and told the wind to calm down, saying to the sea, 'Chill out, relax.' And just like that, the wind stopped and everything became super peaceful."
Mark,4,40,"And they were like, freaking out, and they're all like, 'Yo, what kind of dude is this? He's got mad control over the wind and the sea!'"
Mark,5,1,"So, they sailed to the other side of the sea, heading towards the place called Gadarenes."
Mark,5,2,"So, like, when he got off the boat, there was this dude, coming straight outta the tombs, and he was possessed by, like, an evil spirit."
Mark,5,3,"There was this dude who used to live among the tombs. No one could even try to restrain him, not even with chains, man!"
Mark,5,4,"This guy was always getting tied up with chains and stuff, but he would just break free like it was no big deal. No one could even try to control him, he was that wild."
Mark,5,5,"He was always up in the mountains and chilling in the tombs, straight up crying and hurting himself with stones, day and night."
Mark,5,6,"But when he spotted Jesus from a distance, he dashed over and totally praised him!"
Mark,5,7,"And I yelled really loud, like, seriously loud, and I was like, Jesus, what's up? You're like the Son of the most high God, right? So, I'm begging you, like, seriously, begging you, don't mess with me and make things worse."
Mark,5,8,"He told the unclean spirit, like, 'Yo, get out of the dude.'"
Mark,5,9,"Then he's like, yo what's your name? And the dude's like, I'm Legion, man. We deep in numbers, bro."
Mark,5,10,"And he was like, pleading so hard for him not to kick them out of the hood."
Mark,5,11,"So like, there were these sick pigs chilling, feasting near the mountains."
Mark,5,12,"And all the demons were like, 'Yo, Jesus, bro, can you like, send us into those pigs? We totally wanna possess them, man.'"
Mark,5,13,"So Jesus was like, 'Okay, you can go now!' And then those creepy spirits just left the people and possessed the pigs instead. The whole herd went berserk and ran super fast down a cliff, right into the sea. There were like, 2000 of them and they all drowned. Yikes!"
Mark,5,14,So the people taking care of the pigs totally dipped and spread the word in the city and countryside. Everyone was curious AF and went to check out the situation.
Mark,5,15,"So, they go up to Jesus, and they spot this dude who was totally under the devil's control, like possessed and stuff. But now he's just chilling there, fully dressed, and totally sane. And let me tell you, they were shook!"
Mark,5,16,And the people who saw it explained to them what happened to the person who was possessed by the devil and also about the pigs.
Mark,5,17,"So, like, they were totally begging him to leave their area."
Mark,5,18,"When he got onto the ship, the dude who was all messed up with the devil started begging him to let him roll with him."
Mark,5,19,"But Jesus was like, nah bro, you can't come with us. Instead, go home to your squad and spill the tea about all the amazing things the Lord has done for you. He's totally got mad love for you, fam."
Mark,5,20,"Then he bounced, and started flexing in Decapolis about all the epic stuff Jesus did for him, and everyone was mind-blown."
Mark,5,21,"And when Jesus hopped back on the ship and sailed to the other side, a bunch of people gathered around him, getting really close to the sea."
Mark,5,22,"Yo, check it out! This leader from the synagogue named Jairus rolls up, and when he peeped Jesus, he straight up falls down at his feet."
Mark,5,23,"And I was like, seriously begging him, like, 'Yo, my little sister is almost dying and stuff. Can you, like, please come and put your hands on her so she can be all good and stuff? And I promise you, she will totally live.'"
Mark,5,24,"So Jesus was like, 'Sure, let's go!' And a bunch of people were like, 'Yo, Jesus is going!' And they all started crowding around him."
Mark,5,25,"So there was this girl, right, who had been dealing with a serious blood problem for, like, twelve whole years,"
Mark,5,26,"So this girl had gone through so many doctors, spent all her money, and things just kept getting worse instead of better."
Mark,5,27,"When she found out about Jesus, she snuck through the crowd and reached out to touch his swag."
Mark,5,28,"She's like, 'If I just touch his clothes, I'll be completely healed.'"
Mark,5,29,"And like, immediately the flow of her blood was, like, totally stopped; and she, like, literally felt in her body that she was healed from that terrible disease."
Mark,5,30,"And Jesus, like, instantly realizing that power had gone out of him, turned around in the crowd and was like, 'Yo, who just touched my clothes?'"
Mark,5,31,"And his squad was like, broooo, you see all these people crowding around you, and you ask, like, who just touched you?"
Mark,5,32,And he scoped out the scene to find the one who pulled off this move.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman was shook, like seriously shook, and she knew what went down in her. So, she went up to him, dropped to the floor, and spilled all the tea."
Mark,5,34,"And he was like, 'Yo, girl, your faith is legit, it healed you and stuff. So now you can start living your best life in peace, totally free from that stupid affliction.'"
Mark,5,35,"As he was still talking, some people from the leader of the synagogue's house came and said, 'Your daughter is dead. Why do you bother the Master anymore?'}"
Mark,5,36,"When Jesus heard what was said, he told the synagogue leader, 'No need to stress, just have faith!'"
Mark,5,37,"And he didn't let anyone else come with him, except for Peter, James, and John, who is James' bro."
Mark,5,38,"So he goes to the crib of the big-shot synagogue leader and peeps the wild scene with folks straight up losing it, crying and wailing like no tomorrow."
Mark,5,39,"And after he entered, he said to them, Why are you freaking out and crying? The girl isn't dead, she's just asleep."
Mark,5,40,"And they totally clowned on him. But then he kicked everyone out, and he grabbed the girl's parents and his crew, and went inside where the girl was chilling."
Mark,5,41,"Then he held the girl's hand and said to her, 'Hey sis, get up!' (Talitha cumi means 'damsel, I say to you, arise' BTW)."
Mark,5,42,"And like, the girl immediately got up and started walking; she was, like, totally twelve years old. And everyone was, like, super astonished, like OMG!"
Mark,5,43,He made it clear to them that nobody should find out; and he told them to get something for her to eat.
Mark,6,1,"So he left that place and went back to his hometown, and his squad rolled with him."
Mark,6,2,"On the sabbath day, he started teaching at the synagogue, and a lot of people were blown away, like, 'Where did this guy learn all this stuff? And how is he so wise, doing amazing things like that?'"
Mark,6,3,"Wait, isn't this the dude who's a carpenter? The son of Mary, with siblings named James, Joses, Juda, and Simon? And don't we have his sisters right here with us? But yeah, they got all bothered by him."
Mark,6,4,"Yo, Jesus straight up told them, like, 'A prophet ain't respected in his own hood, with his fam, and even in his own crib.'"
Mark,6,5,"And there, he couldn't perform any epic miracles, except for healing a few sick people by touching them."
Mark,6,6,"And he was totally shook because of how unbelieving they were. So he pulled up to all the villages, dropping knowledge and teaching everyone."
Mark,6,7,"So he rounded up the squad of twelve and decided to split them into pairs and sent them out together, equipped with the mad skills to conquer evil spirits."
Mark,6,8,"And He told them not to bring anything for their journey except a staff; no bag, no food, no cash in their wallet. Cash, by the way, means a small coin worth less than a penny, but in this context, it just means money in general."
Mark,6,9,But wear your kicks and don't flex in two jackets.
Mark,6,10,"And he was like, when you go into a house, just chill there until you leave."
Mark,6,11,"And if anybody doesn't welcome you or listen to you when you leave that place, shake off the dust from under your feet as a sign against them. Seriously, let me tell you, things will be way easier for Sodom and Gomorrah on judgement day compared to that city."
Mark,6,12,"So they dipped, and spread the word that people gotta change their ways, yo."
Mark,6,13,"So they totally expelled loads of evil spirits, and gave a super chill oil treatment to many sick peeps, and made them all feel better."
Mark,6,14,"So, like, King Herod heard about this guy, John the Baptist, 'cause his name was all over the place, you know? And Herod was like, 'Yo, this dude must've come back from the dead or something 'cause he's pulling off some crazy miracles!'"
Mark,6,15,"Some people were like, 'Yo, that dude is Elias.' And others were like, 'Nah, he's definitely a prophet, or maybe like one of the prophets, you know?'"
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod found out, he was like, 'OMG, it's John, the dude I totally got rid of! And now he's back from the dead, like, what?!"
Mark,6,17,"So, like, Herod got all involved and captured John and put him in jail because of Herodias, who was his brother Philip's wife. You know, Herod actually went ahead and married her... pretty messed up, right?"
Mark,6,18,John straight up told Herod that it's against the rules for him to be with his brother's girl.
Mark,6,19,"So Herodias totally had a major problem with him and wanted to straight up eliminate him, but like, she couldn't pull it off, ya know? {a quarrel: or, an inward grudge}"
Mark,6,20,"Herod was low-key intimidated by John because he knew John was a legit righteous dude, like on another level, and he was hella impressed. He would straight up listen to John, do all sorts of stuff because of him, and low-key enjoyed vibing with him. {observed him: or, looked out for him, or, protected him}"
Mark,6,21,"So, like, when the perfect day came, Herod decided to throw this sick birthday bash for all his VIPs, you know, the lords, high-ranking officers, and the big shots from Galilee."
Mark,6,22,"So, when Herodias' daughter came in, danced and totally impressed Herod and all his squad, the king said to the girl, 'Ask me for whatever you want and I'll hook you up.'"
Mark,6,23,"And he was like, swear to her, whatever you want from me, I gotchu, even if it's like half of my kingdom."
Mark,6,24,"So she goes up to her mom like, 'Yo, what should I ask for?' And her mom replies, 'Get me the head of John the Baptist.'"
Mark,6,25,"Then she immediately rushed to the king and asked, saying, 'I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a plate right away.'"
Mark,6,26,"The king was super bummed out, but even though he really wanted to, he couldn't break his promise and ditch her. It was also cuz he didn't wanna look bad in front of his friends sitting with him."
Mark,6,27,"The king wasted no time, he sent a ruthless dude to take care of business. He ordered them to bring his head, and just like that, they chopped it off while he was locked up in prison. It was one of his guards who did the job."
Mark,6,28,"Then they put his head on a plate, and the girl delivered it to her mom."
Mark,6,29,"And when his squad heard about it, they rolled up and handled his body, and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,"So, the apostles like, gathered up around Jesus and spilled all the tea on what they've been up to, you know? They spilled the beans about the things they've done and all the lit stuff they've been teaching."
Mark,6,31,"Yo, listen up! Jesus told his squad, 'Hey, let's ditch this busy scene and find a chill spot in the middle of nowhere to unwind for a bit. People are constantly hounding us, and we haven't even had a chance to grab a bite to eat!'"
Mark,6,32,"And they yeeted to a legit remote spot by ship, all low-key."
Mark,6,33,"So the crowd noticed them leaving, and many recognized him, and hurried there from all over the place, outpacing them and gathering around him."
Mark,6,34,"When Jesus came out, he saw a bunch of people and felt really bad for them because they were lost and didn't have anyone to guide them. So, he started teaching them a bunch of important stuff."
Mark,6,35,"And towards the end of the day, his squad rolled up to him and was like, 'Bro, this place is a total desert and it's getting hella late!'"
Mark,6,36,"Tell them to bounce, so they can hit up the area, check out the small towns, and cop some bread for themselves. They're running on empty, man."
Mark,6,37,"He was like, 'Yo, why don't you guys give them something to eat?' And they were like, 'Bro, are you serious? Should we spend, like, a ton of cash and buy, like, two hundred pounds worth of bread just to feed them?'"
Mark,6,38,"He's like, yo, how much bread y'all got? Go check it out. And they were like, bruh, we got five loaves and two fishes."
Mark,6,39,"And he was like, 'Yo, everyone chill and find a spot on the grass, sit with your squad.'"
Mark,6,40,"And they all gathered together in an organized manner, with groups of one hundred and fifty."
Mark,6,41,"So, like, Jesus took the five loaves and the two fishes, and he looked up to the sky and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples, telling them to serve it to the crowd. And he made sure everyone got their share of the two fishes too."
Mark,6,42,And they all grubbed down and were stuffed.
Mark,6,43,"And they collected twelve big baskets of leftovers, including pieces of fish."
Mark,6,44,And there were like around 5K dudes chowing down on those loaves.
Mark,6,45,"And right away, he told his disciples to hop on the ship and head over to the other side towards Bethsaida, while he sent the crowd away. {over against Bethsaida: or, facing Bethsaida}"
Mark,6,46,"After telling them to bounce, he dipped to a mountain to vibe and talk to God."
Mark,6,47,"And when it got dark, the ship was in the middle of the sea, and he was the only one on the land."
Mark,6,48,"So, Jesus peeped them putting in work to row the boat, but the wind was straight up against them. It was like late at night, around 3 or 4 in the morning, when Jesus rolls up to them, walking on the water. He was low-key gonna keep on strolling, but then he noticed his homies struggling."
Mark,6,49,"But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought he was a ghost and screamed:"
Mark,6,50,"Like, everyone saw him and got totally shook. But then he started chatting with them right away and was like, 'Chillax, dudes! It's me, no need to be scared.'"
Mark,6,51,"So Jesus hopped on their boat, and BOOM, the wind stopped like instantly. His crew was totally freaked out and couldn't believe their eyes, like, seriously amazed!"
Mark,6,52,"Because they totally missed out on how awesome those loaves were, their hearts were like, super closed off and stubborn."
Mark,6,53,"And when they had crossed over, they arrived in the land of Gennesaret and pulled up to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"And when they hopped off the boat, they instantly recognized him,"
Mark,6,55,"Then they totally sprinted all over that area, spreading the word that anyone who was sick could get a lift in beds to wherever they heard Jesus was."
Mark,6,56,"And wherever he went, whether to villages, cities, or the countryside, people placed the sick in the streets and begged him if they could just touch the edge of his garment. And everyone who touched him was completely healed."
Mark,7,1,"So, these Pharisees and some of the scribes from Jerusalem gathered around him."
Mark,7,2,"So like, when these people saw some of his followers chillin' and eating bread without washing their hands, they started trippin' and calling them out. Like, 'ew, their hands are dirty!'"
Mark,7,3,"The Pharisees and all the Jewish peeps, they won't chow down unless they keep scrubbing their hands like crazy. They're all about stickin' to the old-school customs passed down from the OGs. Like, all the way up to their elbows, ya feel?"
Mark,7,4,"And when they come back from the market, they gotta wash up before they can eat. And there are many other traditions they follow, like washing their cups, pots, shiny utensils, and even their tables. (FYI: A sextarius is about a pint and a half!)"
Mark,7,5,"So, like, the Pharisees and scribes were all up in Jesus' face, asking him why his disciples weren't following the old-school traditions of the elders and were chowing down on bread without washing their hands, man?"
Mark,7,6,"He replied and said to them, Isaiah totally called out you hypocrites, just like he wrote, 'These people act all respectful with their mouths, but their hearts are nowhere near me.'"
Mark,7,7,"But honestly, it's pointless for them to worship me, when they focus on teaching human-made rules instead of true teachings."
Mark,7,8,"You're ditching God's rules and sticking to human traditions, like washing pots and cups and doing all sorts of other irrelevant stuff."
Mark,7,9,"And he was like, ouch, you guys totally disregard what God commanded, just so you can hold on to your own traditions. {reject: or, frustrate}"
Mark,7,10,"Moses said, Yo, respect your parents like big time - no doubt! And if anyone decides to throw shade at their parents, they better be ready to face the consequences, 'cause it's serious business, fam. Like, they're asking for a one-way ticket to the grave, ya know what I'm saying?"
Mark,7,11,And you don't let him do anything more for his parents anymore;
Mark,7,12,"Like, you're totally cancelling out the power of God's word by sticking to your old-school tradition that you've passed down. And, let's be real, there are so many other things you do that are just as lame."
Mark,7,13,"So, like, he gathered all the people around him and was like, 'Listen up, guys! Pay attention to what I'm about to say, okay?'"
Mark,7,14,"So, like, dude, hear me out. It's not, like, external stuff that makes you unclean, right? It's more about what comes from within you, bro. That's what really messes you up, you know?"
Mark,7,15,"If anyone has ears, they better listen up."
Mark,7,16,"And when he came home after being with everyone, his followers asked him about the story he had just told."
Mark,7,17,"And he's like, yo, do y'all not get it? Like, anything that goes into a person from the outside can't make them dirty or messed up, ya know?"
Mark,7,18,"Cuz it doesn't go into your heart, but into your stomach, and then gets flushed out, cleaning out all the food?"
Mark,7,19,"And he was like, yo, it's not about what goes into a person that makes them messed up, it's what comes out that makes them defiled."
Mark,7,20,"So, like, the dark side of people, comes from deep within their hearts, you know? Evil thoughts, hookups, doing it before marriage, and even acts of violence, man."
Mark,7,21,"Stealing, wanting what others have, being wicked and deceitful, doing inappropriate things, having a jealous attitude, disrespecting God, being arrogant, acting foolishly: {wanting what others have...: Gr. many desires, wicked actions}"
Mark,7,22,"It's actually insane how all these messed up things come from inside us and totally mess up who we are, like defile us, you know?"
Mark,7,23,"So then he got up and headed towards Tyre and Sidon, and walked into a crib like place, hoping to keep it low-key, but things don't always go as planned, man. He couldn't keep himself under the radar."
Mark,7,24,"There was this awesome chick whose little girl was dealing with some serious negative vibes. When she found out about Jesus, she rushed over and legit fell at his feet like 'Sup, help us out!'"
Mark,7,25,"So there was this girl, right? She was Greek, like a total Syrophenician and all. Anyway, she went up to this dude and straight up asked him to help her get rid of the devil that possessed her daughter. Like, she needed some serious help, you know? {Greek: or, Gentile}"
Mark,7,26,"Yo, Jesus was like, yo lady, chill. Let the kids get filled up first, 'cause it ain't right to take their food and give it to the dogs."
Mark,7,27,"And she was like, 'Yeah, sure, Lord: even the dogs get to munch on the kids' leftovers under the table.'"
Mark,7,28,"He was like, 'Yo, you're good to go now. The devil just bounced outta your daughter.'"
Mark,7,29,"So when she got home, she saw that the devil had bounced, and her daughter was chilling on the bed."
Mark,7,30,"So, like, Jesus left Tyre and Sidon and rolled up to the sea of Galilee, cruising through the area around Decapolis."
Mark,7,31,"So, there was this person who couldn't hear and had trouble talking, and they're like, 'Hey, dude, can you please touch him?'"
Mark,7,32,"Then he pulled him away from the crowd, stuck his fingers in the dude's ears, spit, and tapped his tongue;"
Mark,7,33,"And like, he like, looked up to heaven and was kinda like, sighing, and he said to him, 'Yo, Ephphatha, which means like, 'Be opened'."
Mark,7,34,"And suddenly, his ears were no longer blocked, and the tightness in his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly."
Mark,7,35,"And he told them not to spill the tea, but the more he told them, the more they spilled it like crazy;"
Mark,7,36,"And we were totally amazed, like, for real, saying, He nailed it in every way possible: he made the deaf hear, and the dumb speak, yo."
Mark,8,1,"So back in the day, there were like sooo many people, and they were like totally hungry and had nothing to eat. And then Jesus was like, 'Hey disciples, come over here!' and he said to them,"
Mark,8,2,"I feel for the whole crowd, they've been hanging out with me for like three days straight, and they're totally starving with no food or snacks or anything:"
Mark,8,3,"And, like, if I let them go home without food, they'll totally pass out on the way 'cause, like, some of them came from, like, really far, you know?"
Mark,8,4,"And his squad was like, bro, where the heck are we supposed to find enough bread out here in the middle of nowhere?"
Mark,8,5,"He was like, 'Yo, how much bread y'all got?' And they were like, 'We got seven.'"
Mark,8,6,"So he was like, 'Yo, everyone, let's take a seat on the ground.' Then he grabbed these seven loaves, gave thanks, broke 'em, and gave 'em to his squad to serve to the people. And you know what? They did just that."
Mark,8,7,"And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed them, and told the crew to put the fish in front of everyone as well."
Mark,8,8,"There were like around four thousand peeps who chowed down, and then he let them bounce."
Mark,8,9,"Then he hopped on a boat real quick with his crew, and they sailed over to Dalmanutha."
Mark,8,10,"So, like, the Pharisees showed up and started hittin' him with all these questions, asking for some major heavenly sign, just tryin' to trip him up."
Mark,8,11,"And he was like, really frustrated inside, and he's like, yo why is this generation always looking for some crazy proof? Honestly, I'm telling you, they ain't gonna get any proof at all."
Mark,8,12,"And he dipped out, hopped back on the ship, and sailed off to the other side."
Mark,8,13,"So, like, the disciples totally spaced and didn't bring any bread. And get this, they only had one loaf with them in the ship."
Mark,8,14,"Yo, listen up, guys! Be careful and stay woke because we need to watch out for the toxic influences of the Pharisees and Herod. Don't let their bad vibes mess with your faith."
Mark,8,15,"And they were like, bro, we're outta bread."
Mark,8,16,"And when Jesus found out, he said to them, 'Why are you freaking out about not having bread? Don't you get it yet? Can't you see or comprehend? Is your mindset still closed off?'"
Mark,8,17,"Like, do you even see with your eyes? And do you even hear with your ears? And like, do you even remember stuff?"
Mark,8,18,"When I shared out the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets did you guys collect as leftovers? They were like, 'Um, twelve.'"
Mark,8,19,"Yo, when we had seven loaves and fed like four thousand fam, how many baskets full of leftovers did we collect? And they were like, 'Seven, bro.'"
Mark,8,20,"And he was like, bruh, how come y'all don't get it?"
Mark,8,21,"So Jesus goes to Bethsaida, and they bring a blind dude to him, begging him to give him a touch."
Mark,8,22,"Then he grabbed the blind dude's hand and took him out of the town. After that, he like, spit on the guy's eyes, and then put his hands on him. Then he straight up asked him if he could see anything."
Mark,8,23,"And he like, looked up and was like, yo, I see these dudes and they lookin' like trees but they walkin' and stuff."
Mark,8,24,"Then he touched his eyes again, and like, he opened them and could see perfectly, no cap. He saw everyone clearly, like straight up no blurry vision or anything."
Mark,8,25,"And he was like, 'Yo, go back to your crib, bro. But don't even think about going into the town or spreading the news to anyone there.'"
Mark,8,26,"So Jesus and his squad rolled into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. As they were chillin' on the way, Jesus turned to his crew and hit 'em with a question: 'Yo, who do people say I am?'"
Mark,8,27,"And they were like, 'Yo, it's John the Baptist,' but then there were others who were like, 'Nah, it's Elias,' and some were even saying, 'Maybe one of the prophets, you know?'"
Mark,8,28,"And he's like, yo, who do you guys say I am? And Peter's like, bro, you're the Christ."
Mark,8,29,"And he was like, yo, don't go spreading the word about him, okay?"
Mark,8,30,"So, like, Jesus started dropping some knowledge on his squad. He told them that He, being the Son of Man, was gonna go through a lot of hardships, get straight up rejected by the OGs like the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and even get killed. But don't trip, fam, 'cause after three days, He's gonna bounce back and rise up again."
Mark,8,31,"And he straight up said that out loud. And Peter was like, 'Hold up!' and started scolding him."
Mark,8,32,"But when he turned around and looked at his squad, he called out Peter, saying, 'Get outta here, bro, you're on some Satan-level vibes! You're not into what God's about, you're all about that worldly stuff.'"
Mark,8,33,"And when Jesus gathered everyone, including his disciples, he told them, if you wanna roll with me, first thing you gotta do is let go of your ego, embrace hardships, and walk the same path as me."
Mark,8,34,"If anyone tries to hold onto their life, they'll end up losing it. But those who are willing to let go of their life for my sake and the good news will actually save it."
Mark,8,35,"Like imagine, what's the point of flexing big time and getting all the clout in the world, if you end up losing your own essence?"
Mark,8,36,"Like, seriously, what can a person even offer to trade for their soul?"
Mark,8,37,"If anyone is embarrassed to associate with me and my words in this messed up and sinful generation, then I'll also be embarrassed of them when I return in full glory with my heavenly squad."
Mark,9,1,"Yo, listen up fam, for real, I'm telling you straight up, there are some of y'all right here who ain't gonna kick the bucket until you witness the kingdom of God showin' up in all its epicness."
Mark,9,2,"So, like, after six days, Jesus grabs Peter, James, and John, and takes them up this super tall mountain, away from everyone else. And then, boom! Jesus starts glowing and changing before their very eyes."
Mark,9,3,"And his outfit was like, super lit, shining so bright, even whiter than fresh snow; like, no clothing brand can make them that white."
Mark,9,4,And then Elias and Moses showed up and started chatting with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,"And Peter was like, 'Yo Jesus, this place is lit! We should totally set up three sick tents - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elias.'"
Mark,9,6,"He didn't know what to say, because they were really scared."
Mark,9,7,"So, like, there's this huge cloud that totally covered them, and then a voice like boomed out of the cloud, saying, 'Yo, guys, this here is my super beloved Son, OK? You better listen to what he's gotta say!'"
Mark,9,8,"And just like that, when they turned their heads, they were like, 'Uh, where did everyone go?' It was just Jesus, chilling with them."
Mark,9,9,"After they came down from the mountain, he told them not to spill the beans about what they saw until the Son of man came back from the dead."
Mark,9,10,"And they were like, totally keeping that saying in their minds, and like, discussing with each other what it meant to rise from the dead."
Mark,9,11,"So, they were asking him, like, why do the scribes keep saying that Elias has to come first?"
Mark,9,12,"And he was like, yo, listen up! Elias will totally come before anyone else and fix all the things that got messed up. And it's written that the Son of man must go through a whole lot of suffering and be treated like he ain't even important."
Mark,9,13,"Yo, listen up! Lemme tell ya, Elijah has totally arrived, and they did whatever they wanted to him, just like it was predictably written."
Mark,9,14,"And when he came back to his squad, he peeped a huge crowd vibing with them, and the intellectuals were throwing questions at them."
Mark,9,15,"Like, as soon as everyone saw him, they were totally mind-blown and started rushing over to greet him."
Mark,9,16,"He was like, hey scribes, what's the deal with all the questions you're asking each other?"
Mark,9,17,"Yo, listen up! So this dude from the crowd steps forward and is like, 'Sup, Master? I brought my son to you, man. He's got some issue with his speech, you know?'"
Mark,9,18,"And wherever he grabs hold of him, he wrecks havoc on him: freaking out, grinding his teeth, and wasting away. I told your crew to kick him out, but they couldn't handle it."
Mark,9,19,"He responds and says, like, seriously, this generation has no faith at all. How much longer do I have to stick around? How much longer do I have to put up with you all? Just bring him to me."
Mark,9,20,"Then they brought him over to him and as soon as he caught a glimpse of him, the spirit totally freaked out and went all crazy. The guy ended up falling on the ground, rolling around and frothing at the mouth."
Mark,9,21,"So he asked his dad, like when did this start happening to him? And his dad was like, since he was a kid, man."
Mark,9,22,"And, like, this thing has like, totally thrown him into the fire and water so many times, trying to, like, destroy him. But, if you have the power to do something, like, please show us some compassion and, like, help us out."
Mark,9,23,"Jesus was like, 'Dude, if you can actually believe, then you can totally make anything happen. It's all about having faith, bro."
Mark,9,24,"Immediately, the dad of the kid shouted, and with tears, he said, 'Yo, Lord, I totally believe, but I need some help with my doubts.'"
Mark,9,25,"When Jesus peeped that all the peeps were flocking to him, he called out the trash spirit, like 'Yo, you mute and deaf spirit, I'm telling you, get out of him and don't even think about coming back.'"
Mark,9,26,"And the spirit was like, freaking out and causing him a lot of pain, and then it left him. And he was totally out of it, like unconscious, to the point where a bunch of people were like, 'Yo, this dude is dead.'"
Mark,9,27,"Yo, Jesus grabbed his hand, pulled him up, and the dude straight up got back on his feet."
Mark,9,28,"So, like, when he went into the crib, his homies hit him up on the low and were like, yo, why couldn't we flex and get rid of that dude?"
Mark,9,29,"And he was like, yo, this situation can only be dealt with through some serious prayer and fasting."
Mark,9,30,"And then they left that place and went through Galilee, and he didn't want anyone to know about it."
Mark,9,31,"Yo, he schooled his squad and straight up said, 'The Son of man is gonna get handed over to these dudes, and they're gonna straight up take him out. But don't trip, 'cause three days later, homie's gonna come back from the dead.'"
Mark,9,32,"But they didn't get what he was saying, and were too scared to ask him about it."
Mark,9,33,"And he rolled up in Capernaum and was chilling at the crib, when he hit them up like, 'Yo, what was that argument about on the way here?'"
Mark,9,34,But they stayed quiet because they were arguing about who was the most amazing on the down low.
Mark,9,35,"So, he sits down and gathers the twelve and says to them, 'If any of you wants to be the top dog, you gotta be the bottom of the pack and serve everyone.'"
Mark,9,36,"So he grabbed this kid and put him right in the center of the group. And after snuggling him close, he started talking to everyone and said,"
Mark,9,37,"Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name, welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me, doesn't just welcome me, but the One who sent me."
Mark,9,38,"Yo, Jesus, listen up. So, John here tells you that we saw some dude who's not part of our crew casting out demons in your name. And, you know what? We totally shut him down 'cause he's not rollin' with us."
Mark,9,39,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Chill, don't stop him.' Cuz let me tell you, no one who does miracles in my name can just go around disrespecting me like that."
Mark,9,40,"Yo, anyone who ain't against us is totally with us, fam."
Mark,9,41,"Listen up, fam! If someone hooks you up with a sick water refreshment in my name, 'cause you're repping Christ, then let me tell you, they won't miss out on the ultimate blessings. No cap!"
Mark,9,42,"If anyone messes with one of these little homies who believe in me, they better watch out because it would be way better for them to have a huge weight tied to their neck and get yeeted into the ocean."
Mark,9,43,"If your hand causes you problems, get rid of it: it's way better to live with only one hand and make it to a good life, instead of ending up in a place that's always on fire, and trust me, it never gets put out. {offend...: or, make you do wrong}"
Mark,9,44,"When that slimy creature keeps on going, and the flames just keep on raging."
Mark,9,45,"If something you do or engage in causes you trouble or leads you astray, remove it from your life: it's more beneficial for you to enter life with a handicap, rather than having full freedom but end up in an eternal place of suffering called hell, where the fire never goes out. {offend...: or, cause you to stumble}"
Mark,9,46,"Where their worm can't even, and the fire is forever lit."
Mark,9,47,"And if something you see on social media bothers you or tempts you to sin, it's better to unfollow or block it: it's way cooler for you to be part of God's kingdom with limited exposure, rather than being sucked into unnecessary drama and negativity."
Mark,9,48,"Where their TikTok followers never unfollow, and the flame never gets extinguished."
Mark,9,49,"Yo, everyone's gonna be lit up with fire, and every sacrifice gonna get that extra flavor with some salt."
Mark,9,50,"Salt is legit awesome: but if the salt loses its flavor, how are you gonna spice things up? Keep that saltiness within yourself and spread the good vibes with one another."
Mark,10,1,"And he like totally got up from there and went to the chill areas of Judaea on the other side of the Jordan. And the people gathered around him once more, just like before, and he started teaching them again."
Mark,10,2,"Then the Pharisees rolled up on him and straight up asked, 'Is it cool for a dude to ditch his wifey? Testing him out.'"
Mark,10,3,"And he was like, yo, what did Moses tell you to do?"
Mark,10,4,"And they were like, yo, Moses was cool with writing a note to split up and break up with his girl."
Mark,10,5,"And Jesus was like, 'Listen up, y'all! I gotta break it down for you. The reason why He gave you this commandment was because your hearts were too stubborn to get it.'"
Mark,10,6,"But like, from day one of everything, God totally created two genders - male and female."
Mark,10,7,That's why a dude will peace out from his fam and stick with his wifey;
Mark,10,8,"And these two people will become united as one: and so, they are no longer two individuals, but a single entity."
Mark,10,9,"So, like, if God brings two people together, don't let anyone break them apart, okay?"
Mark,10,10,"And in the crib, his squad asked him again about the same {stuff}."
Mark,10,11,"And he's like, yo, anyone who breaks up with their girl and gets with someone else, that's straight up cheating on her."
Mark,10,12,"And like, if a girl decides to ditch her man and gets with someone else, she's straight up committing adultery, no cap."
Mark,10,13,"So, there were these people who brought some kids to Jesus, hoping that he would bless them with a touch. But guess what? His disciples were all like, 'Hey, hold up! We don't need these kids crowding up the place!'"
Mark,10,14,"When Jesus saw that, he got pretty annoyed and was like, 'Yo, let the little kids come to me and don't even think about stopping them. 'Cause those kiddos are all about God's kingdom, you know.'"
Mark,10,15,"Listen up, fam! If you don't embrace the kingdom of God with a childlike heart, you won't be allowed in, period."
Mark,10,16,"And he grabbed them in a big hug, gave them high fives, and sent them good vibes."
Mark,10,17,"And while he was walking, someone came running up to him and got down on their knees, asking him, 'Hey, awesome teacher! What do I gotta do to get that eternal life?'"
Mark,10,18,"And Jesus was like, yo dude, why you callin' me good? Only one who's truly good, and that's God, bro."
Mark,10,19,"You know the rules, like don't cheat on your bae, don't take someone's life, don't swipe their stuff, don't spread lies, don't scam them, and always give props to your parents."
Mark,10,20,"And he's like, yo, I gotta be real with you, Master. Like, I've been keeping up with all this stuff since I was a youngin'."
Mark,10,21,"Yo, Jesus peeped this dude and legit felt love for him, and he straight up told him, 'Bruh, you lack just one thing: bounce outta here, sell all your stuff, and give it to those in need, and you'll be stacking up heavenly riches. Also, come through, grab that cross, and roll with me.'"
Mark,10,22,"And he was totally bummed out by what was said, and walked off feeling super down: 'cause he had, like, a ton of stuff."
Mark,10,23,"So Jesus, like, totally scoped out the scene and was all like, 'Yo, to my crew, you feel me? It's gonna be, like, mad tough for those loaded peeps to get into God's kingdom, ya know?'"
Mark,10,24,"The disciples were like, totally shook by what Jesus said. But yo, Jesus dropped more knowledge and was like, 'Listen up, fam, it's mad difficult for those who rely on money to get into God's kingdom!'"
Mark,10,25,"Like, seriously, it's hella easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for some rich dude to make it into God's kingdom."
Mark,10,26,"And they were like, totally shook, saying to themselves, like, who can ever be saved, though?"
Mark,10,27,"And Jesus was like, yo fam, peep this: On the real, it's straight up impossible for humans, but let me tell you, ain't nothin' impossible when it comes to God. He's got the mad skills to make anything happen."
Mark,10,28,"Yo, Peter was like, 'Bro, check it. We dropped everything and straight up started rollin' with you.'"
Mark,10,29,"And Jesus was like, yo, listen up fam. For real though, hear me out. There ain't nobody out there who's ditched their crib, their bros and sisters, their oldies, their spouse, their kiddos, or their land just for me and the good news I'm bringing."
Mark,10,30,"But he's gonna get, like, a hundred times more cool stuff in this life, you know? Like awesome houses, new bros, lit sisters, awesome moms, cool kids, and even sick lands! But, here's the twist - he'll also face some haters and challenges. And, yo, if that ain't enough, in the next life, he's gonna score that eternal life vibe. No joke!"
Mark,10,31,"But, like, a lot of peeps who think they're at the top are gonna end up at the bottom, and the ones who started out at the bottom will actually be first. It's all about the unexpected flips, yo."
Mark,10,32,"So they were all on their way to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the pack. The disciples were totally shook and totally in awe. But then, they started feeling mad scared as they followed. Jesus noticed this and gathered the twelve close, and started spilling the tea on what was about to go down with him."
Mark,10,33,"Yo, listen up! We're heading to Jerusalem, and guess what? The Son of man is gonna get handed over to the big bosses - the chief priests and the scribes. And you won't believe it, but they're gonna condemn Him to death! After that, they're gonna pass Him on to the Gentiles. Crazy, right?"
Mark,10,34,"And they're gonna totally clown on him, and beat him up, and spit on him, and straight up murder him: but guess what? He's gonna rise from the dead on the third day, no joke!"
Mark,10,35,"So, like, James and John, you know, the sons of Zebedee, they walk up to Jesus and they're like, 'Hey, Master, we want you to, like, do whatever we ask of you.'"
Mark,10,36,"And he was like, yo, what can I do for y'all?"
Mark,10,37,"They were like, 'Hey, can we chill with you in your glory? Like, one of us on your right and the other on your left?'"
Mark,10,38,"But Jesus was like, yo, you guys have no idea what you're asking for: are you able to handle the same challenges and experiences that I'm going through?"
Mark,10,39,"And they were like, 'Yeah, we can totally handle that.' And Jesus was like, 'For sure, you will have a taste of the same challenges as me, and you will go through the same intense experiences as me.'"
Mark,10,40,But I can't just decide who gets to chill on my right and left side; it's not up to me. It's reserved for those who are meant to be there.
Mark,10,41,"And when the squad heard it, they totally lost it on James and John."
Mark,10,42,"But Jesus gathered them around and said, 'You know how those in power among the non-believers enjoy bossing people around, and their elites love throwing their weight around.'"
Mark,10,43,"But it's not gonna be like that for you. If you wanna be super awesome, you gotta be a total servant, dude."
Mark,10,44,"And whoever among you wants to be the top dog, gotta be the ultimate squad member."
Mark,10,45,"Yo, even Jesus himself didn't come to be served, but to serve and sacrifice his life as a ransom for many, fam."
Mark,10,46,"So they arrived at Jericho, and as Jesus was leaving with his squad and a huge crowd, there was this blind dude named Bartimaeus, who was Timaeus' son, posted up by the road begging."
Mark,10,47,"When he found out it was Jesus from Nazareth, he started freaking out and yelled, 'Yo, Jesus, you're the real deal, Son of David! Show me some love, man!'"
Mark,10,48,"A bunch of people were telling him to shut up, but he shouted even louder, saying, 'Yo, Son of David, have mercy on me!'"
Mark,10,49,"So Jesus, like, stops right there and tells his crew to call the blind dude. They're like, 'Yo, dude, cheer up! Get up, he wants to talk to you.'"
Mark,10,50,"Then, he ditched his outfit, got up, and went over to Jesus."
Mark,10,51,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo dude, what can I do for you?' And the blind man was all like, Lordd, I just wanna be able to see again.'"
Mark,10,52,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, go about your business; your faith is what made you whole, fam. And right then and there, homeboy got his sight back and started rollin' with Jesus."
Mark,11,1,"And when they got close to Jerusalem, like, in Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he's like, 'Yo, go send two of my squad members,'"
Mark,11,2,"Yo, listen up, fam! Head to the village right across from you. Once you get there, you'll spot a sick colt tied up. No one has ever ridden on it before, so set it free and bring it back here."
Mark,11,3,"And if someone asks you why are you doing this? Just tell them that the Lord needs it, and they'll send it right away."
Mark,11,4,"So, like, they headed out and spotted the colt tied up by the door in a spot where two roads crossed, and they set it free."
Mark,11,5,"And some of the people standing there asked them, 'Yo, what are you doing, untying that colt?'"
Mark,11,6,"So, like, they did what Jesus said and, like, let them go, just as He told them to do."
Mark,11,7,"So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and he sat on it like a boss."
Mark,11,8,"And a bunch of people placed their clothes on the pavement, while others grabbed tree branches and scattered them on the ground."
Mark,11,9,"And the people who were walking ahead and those who were following behind shouted, saying, OMG; like, this person is totally blessed, coming in the name of the Lord:"
Mark,11,10,"Praise the kingdom of our OG, King David, who's rolling up in the Lord's name. Hosanna to the max, y'all!"
Mark,11,11,"So Jesus rolled into Jerusalem, and he totally checked out the temple. After scoping out everything, and when the sun was setting, he dipped out to Bethany with his squad of twelve."
Mark,11,12,"The next day, after they came from Bethany, Jesus was like super hungry:"
Mark,11,13,"And like, he spotted this fig tree from a distance, and it had all these fresh leaves, so he went over to it, hoping to find some figs on there or something. But when he got there, there was literally nothing except leaves because it wasn't the right time for figs, you know."
Mark,11,14,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, no one's gonna munch on your fruit ever again.' His crew heard what he said."
Mark,11,15,"So, they arrive in Jerusalem, and Jesus rolls up to the temple like a boss. He starts kicking out all those money-making merchants and flipping tables left and right. He even gives the doves-sellers a piece of his mind and sends them packing."
Mark,11,16,And they didn't let anyone bring any stuff through the temple.
Mark,11,17,"And he was like, yo listen up, isn't it written that my crib should be known as a sick place for everybody to pray? But y'all turned it into a literal hideout for thieves. Like seriously? SMH. #prayerGoneWrong #HouseOfThieves"
Mark,11,18,"The scribes and chief priests heard what was up and were plotting how to cancel him, since they were shook by his teachings that blew everyone away."
Mark,11,19,"And when the sun went down, he bounced out of the city."
Mark,11,20,"And the next morning, while they were walking, they noticed that the fig tree had totally withered from its roots."
Mark,11,21,"And then Peter, like, remembers and says to Jesus, 'Yo, look! The fig tree that you cursed is totally dried up and dead.'"
Mark,11,22,"And Jesus replied, like, listen up fam, y'all gotta have mad trust in God. I'm talking about like being 110% confident in His power and plan. Trust me, He's got you covered. Keep it 💯 and believe in God's abilities, ya feel me? 🙌🏼 {Have...: or, Have the faith of God}"
Mark,11,23,"Listen up, fam. I'm telling you the truth: Anyone who confidently tells this mountain to straight up move and dive into the sea, believing deep in their heart that it'll actually happen, can straight up have whatever they want. No doubt, just mad faith."
Mark,11,24,"So, listen up fam, here's the deal: Whatever you want, when you pray, just believe you're gonna get it, and trust me, you gonna have it."
Mark,11,25,"And when you're in your zone, sending up prayers, make sure you let go of any grudges you're holding against anyone. That way, your Father up in the heavens can forgive you for any wrongs you've done yourself."
Mark,11,26,"But like, if you don't forgive, then your heavenly Father won't forgive your wrongdoings, ya know?"
Mark,11,27,"So they go back to Jerusalem, and as he's walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders approach him."
Mark,11,28,"Yo, like, who gave you the power to do all this stuff? And what's the deal with your authority anyways?"
Mark,11,29,"Yo, Jesus replied to them, like, I've got a question for you too. Answer me, and then I'll let you know where I get the authority to do all these things. And, yo, this question is the real deal, no cap. So, are you ready to spill the tea or what?"
Mark,11,30,"Yo, the baptism of John, was it legit from heaven, or was it just something people made up? Give me an answer, fam."
Mark,11,31,"So, like, they were totally having this convo with themselves, and they were like, 'If we say it's from heaven, he's gonna be like, 'Well, why didn't you believe him then?'"
Mark,11,32,"But if we say, like, they were scared of the people because everyone legit thought John was a total prophet."
Mark,11,33,"They were like, um, Jesus, we have no clue. And Jesus was like, yeah, I'm not gonna spill the tea on how I do my thing either."
Mark,12,1,"So, like, this dude started telling them a story using parables. There was this guy who decided to plant a vineyard and put a hedge around it. He even made a spot for the wine-making equipment and built a tower. Then, he rented it out to some people to take care of it and left for a faraway place."
Mark,12,2,"Then, at the right time, he DM'd the farmers, asking for some dank grapes from their vineyard."
Mark,12,3,"And they nabbed {him}, gave {him} a beating, and sent {him} off with nothing."
Mark,12,4,"Then he sent another person to them, but they threw stones at him and hurt him in the head. They treated him disrespectfully and sent him away in a shameful manner."
Mark,12,5,"Then he sent another person, but they killed him too, along with many others. Some were beaten, while others were killed."
Mark,12,6,"So this guy had one son left, and he was super important to him. He decided to send him to those people, thinking they would totally respect and honor his son."
Mark,12,7,"But those people taking care of the land were thinking to themselves, 'Yo, this guy is gonna inherit everything. Let's eliminate him and claim the inheritance for ourselves.'"
Mark,12,8,"So they grabbed him, straight up did him dirty, and straight up yeeted him outta the vineyard."
Mark,12,9,"So what's the move for the vineyard owner? He's gonna show up and straight up wreck those farmers, then pass the vineyard on to someone else."
Mark,12,10,"Yo, haven't y'all peeped this scripture? The stone that the builders straight up dissed is now the boss of the whole place:"
Mark,12,11,"OMG, this was totally the Lord's doing and it's like, so unbelievable and amazing to us, you know?"
Mark,12,12,"So, like, they totally wanted to grab him, but they were scared of the crowd 'cause they knew he had thrown shade at them with that parable. So they bounced and just went on their own path."
Mark,12,13,"So, like, the Pharisees and the Herodians decided to send some people to trick him, you know, by getting him to say something they could use against him."
Mark,12,14,"And, like, when they arrived, they were all like, 'Yo, dude, we know you're legit and don't play favorites. You always keep it real and teach us about God's ways, no cap. So, is it cool to pay taxes to Caesar or nah?"
Mark,12,15,"So, like, are we supposed to give or not? But Jesus, totally seeing through their fakeness, was like, why are you trying to test me? Give me a coin and let me check it out. (By the way, that coin was worth like seven and a half pennies in our money.)"
Mark,12,16,"So they brought it over. And he's like, 'Yo, whose face and name is on this?' And they're all like, 'Caesar's, dude.'"
Mark,12,17,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, you gotta give Caesar what belongs to him, and give God what belongs to Him.' And everyone was, like, totally mind-blown."
Mark,12,18,"So the Sadducees approach him, saying that there's no such thing as a resurrection, and they question him, like,"
Mark,12,19,"Yo, dude, check it out. According to Moses, if a guy's bro dies without having any kids, his bro should step up and marry his wife to keep the family line going, ya know?"
Mark,12,20,"So, there were these seven siblings, right? And the oldest one got hitched, but unfortunately, he passed away without leaving any kids behind."
Mark,12,21,"Then the second guy married her, but he died and didn't have any kids either. The third guy did the same thing."
Mark,12,22,"And the seven dudes dated her, but none of them had babies with her. Finally, the woman passed away too."
Mark,12,23,"So, like, when people rise up after resurrection, who's gonna be married to her? 'Cause, you know, seven dudes already had her as their wife."
Mark,12,24,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, you guys are totally trippin' because you don't even know what the scriptures say, or how powerful God is. Like, get your facts straight, fam.'"
Mark,12,25,"So, like, when peeps come back from the dead, they don't get hitched or have those marriage vibes. They totally become angel-like, just like them heavenly beings up in the sky."
Mark,12,26,"And speaking about the dead coming back to life, have you not read in the book of Moses how God talked to him in the burning bush, saying, I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?"
Mark,12,27,"God isn't all about the dead vibes, but He's all about the living ones. So y'all are totally off-track, fam."
Mark,12,28,"So this scribe shows up, right, and he hears them all talking and he notices that this guy gives a dope answer. So he goes up to him and asks, like, what's the most important commandment?"
Mark,12,29,"And Jesus was like, dude, the most important commandment ever is listen up, Israel: our God, he's the one and only Lord, for real."
Mark,12,30,"And, like, you gotta love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. Seriously, it's the number one commandment and stuff."
Mark,12,31,"And, like, here's the deal: the second rule is just as important as the first. It's all about loving your neighbor as much as you love yourself. No other rule can top these, for real."
Mark,12,32,"And the scribe was like, legit, bro, you just dropped some major truth bombs. Like, there's only one big dude upstairs, no one else comes close."
Mark,12,33,"And, like, loving him with, like, all your heart, and like, all your understanding, and like, all your soul, and like, all your strength, and, you know, loving your neighbor as yourself, is, like, way more important than just making sacrifices and burnt offerings and stuff. Seriously, it's the real deal."
Mark,12,34,"When Jesus noticed that he gave a smart answer, he said to him, 'You're pretty close to the kingdom of God. And from then on, nobody had the guts to ask him {anything}.'"
Mark,12,35,"And Jesus was like, teaching in the temple or whatever, and he's like, 'Yo, so the scribes be saying that the Christ is the Son of David? Like, is that true or nah?'"
Mark,12,36,"David was like, inspired by the Holy Ghost and he straight up said, 'The LORD told my Lord, 'Yo, take a seat on my right side until I make all your haters bow down at your feet.'"
Mark,12,37,"So like, David is all like calling him Lord and stuff, but wait, how can he be his son too? And the regular folks were totally into what he was saying."
Mark,12,38,"And he was like, yo listen up, peeps! Pay attention to the scribblers, they're all about flexin' in their fancy outfits and soaking up all them greetings in the public square."
Mark,12,39,"And whoever gets the VIP spots at the synagogues, and the coolest places at the feasts:"
Mark,12,40,"They totally scam widows out of their money and pretend to be all holy with their super long prayers - guess what? Yeah, they're in for some serious punishment!"
Mark,12,41,"So, Jesus was chilling by the treasure spot, and he watched as people started tossing their cash into it. And let me tell you, there were some rich peeps who were straight up making it rain with their stacks. Oh, and just FYI, the money we're talking about here, it was like some old-school brass coins or whatever. Ya dig?"
Mark,12,42,"So this one time, there was this super broke widow who showed up and dropped in two mites, aka like practically nothing. Just to be clear, mites are like the seventh part of one brass coin, ya feel me?"
Mark,12,43,"So, like, Jesus gathered his squad of disciples and was all like, 'Yo dudes, for real, listen up. This poor widow right here? She just dropped way more cash into the donation box than all those other peeps combined.'"
Mark,12,44,"All those rich people were flexing with their extra cash, but this one girl, even though she was broke, still dropped all she had, her whole life savings."
Mark,13,1,"Yo, as Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his followers was like, 'Dude, check out these crazy stones and buildings!'"
Mark,13,2,"Yo, Jesus replied and was like, 'Yo dude, check out these sick buildings. I'm telling you, not a single stone's gonna be left standing here. They're all gonna get totally wrecked, man.'"
Mark,13,3,"And, like, Jesus was chillin' on the mount of Olives, you know, across from the temple, when Peter, James, John, and Andrew approached him for a private convo."
Mark,13,4,"Yo fam, when is all this gonna go down? And like, how are we gonna know when it's actually happening?"
Mark,13,5,"And Jesus was like, yo, pay attention 'cause you don't wanna get played by some random fool, okay?"
Mark,13,6,"A lot of people will pop up, claiming to be the real deal, saying, 'I'm {Christ},' and they'll trick a bunch of people."
Mark,13,7,"Yo, when you start hearing about wars and all those rumors of wars, don't get all freaked out, 'cause that stuff's bound to happen. But hold up, the end ain't coming just yet, fam."
Mark,13,8,"So, like, different nations are gonna be, like, beefing with each other, and kingdoms will be straight up clashing, you know? And there will be earthquakes happening all over the place, along with famines and all sorts of troubles. Basically, these are just the early signs of some serious chaotic times. Just imagine the intense pain a woman feels during labor, it's kinda like that."
Mark,13,9,"Yo, just a heads up, watch out for yourselves: 'cause they're gonna hand you over to these councils and in the synagogues, you might catch some serious beatings. And get this, you'll be brought before rulers and even kings, all because of me. It's like a way to show the truth and call them out, you know?"
Mark,13,10,"And yo, the good news gotta be spread to all the nations, no cap."
Mark,13,11,"But, like, when people try to cancel you and expose you, don't stress about what to say in advance, like don't plan it out, just go with the flow: whatever comes to you in that moment, that's what you should say. 'Cause it's not really you speaking, it's the Holy Ghost."
Mark,13,12,"Yo, listen up! It's gonna get real intense. Brothers turning on each other, even to the point of death. Fathers betraying their own sons, and kids straight up rebelling against their own parents, leading to some serious consequences... like, yeah, death."
Mark,13,13,"And, like, just so you know, people are totally gonna hate on you because of me, but if you can, like, totally stick it out till the very end, then you'll totally be saved, no doubt."
Mark,13,14,"But when you see the terrible thing that brings destruction, like Daniel the prophet said, in a place it shouldn't be (let the reader get it), then the peeps in Judaea gotta run to the mountains:"
Mark,13,15,"And if you're up on the roof, don't bother going back inside the house to grab anything from there."
Mark,13,16,"And if you're out and about, don't bother going back to grab your stuff."
Mark,13,17,"But, like, seriously, it's gonna be really tough for those who are pregnant or have newborns during that time!"
Mark,13,18,And make sure to pray that your journey doesn't happen during the winter.
Mark,13,19,"Those days are gonna be rough, like nothing we've ever seen before since the start of creation. It's gonna be a unique kind of struggle, like no other."
Mark,13,20,"And if the Lord hadn't shortened those days, no one would survive: but for the chosen few that He has handpicked, He decided to shorten the days."
Mark,13,21,"And if someone tells you, like, 'Yo, Christ is over here' or 'Yo, Christ is over there,' don't believe them, okay?"
Mark,13,22,"So, like, there will be all these fake Christs and fake prophets popping up, doing fancy tricks and stuff, trying to deceive even the most chosen ones. It's wild, man."
Mark,13,23,"But listen up: yo, I already warned y'all about everything."
Mark,13,24,"But like, during that time, after all that intense stuff, the sun is gonna be all gloomy, and the moon won't even shine."
Mark,13,25,"And, like, the stars in the sky will totally fall, and the mighty forces up there will be like, shaken real hard, you know?"
Mark,13,26,"And then, they gonna witness the Son of man showing up in the sky with mad power and total awesomeness."
Mark,13,27,"And then he'll text his angels, and they'll gather all his chosen ones from every corner, from literally everywhere on the earth and even way up into the skies."
Mark,13,28,"Here's a story about a fig tree: When its branches start growing and leaves pop out, you know summer is right around the corner:"
Mark,13,29,"So, like, when you see these things happening, you gotta realize that it's about to go down, it's literally right at the doors."
Mark,13,30,"Listen up fam, I'm telling you for real, this squad right here won't bounce until everything on this checklist is complete."
Mark,13,31,"Yo, listen up! Heaven and earth may disappear one day, but my words are gonna last forever, no cap."
Mark,13,32,"But no one knows the exact day and time, not even the angels up in heaven or even the Son, only the Father knows."
Mark,13,33,"Yo, listen up and stay woke: be mindful, peep what's going on and stay in prayer, 'cause you never know when it's gonna go down."
Mark,13,34,"So, imagine this, the Son of man is like a dude going on a total epic journey. He bounces from his crib, and hands over some serious power to his crew and assigns each person a specific task. He straight up tells the bouncer to keep a watchful eye."
Mark,13,35,"Yo, stay woke, cuz you never know when the homie in charge is gonna roll up. Could be in the evening, or middle of the night, or when the birds start chirpin', or even in the morning, fam."
Mark,13,36,In case he pulls up out of nowhere and catches you snoozin'.
Mark,13,37,"And yo, what I'm tellin' all y'all, I'm tellin' everyone, stay woke."
Mark,14,1,"In like, two days, it was time for the passover and the unleavened bread thing, ya know? And yo, the big priests and the scholars were scheming on how to catch this dude, Jesus, slyly and end his life, straight up."
Mark,14,2,"But they were like, nah, not gonna do it during the big event cause it might cause a major commotion among the crowd, you know?"
Mark,14,3,"So, Jesus was chillin' at Simon the leper's crib in Bethany, just, you know, having a meal and stuff. Then, out of nowhere, this girl shows up with a fancy alabaster jar full of super expensive spikenard perfume. And she straight up breaks that jar and pours all of it onto Jesus' head. (P.S. Spikenard is basically, like, pure nard or liquid nard, in case you were wondering)."
Mark,14,4,"And there were some peeps who were totally triggered deep down, and they were like, why the heck was this precious ointment wasted, yo?"
Mark,14,5,"That could've been sold for way more cash, like over 300 coins, and the money could've helped out the less fortunate. But no, some people just had to complain about it."
Mark,14,6,"And Jesus was like, yo, just leave her alone, why you gotta bother her? She straight up did something really good for me."
Mark,14,7,"You know, there will always be peeps who are struggling in life, and whenever you want, you can totally step up and help them out. But, you won't always have me by your side, ya know?"
Mark,14,8,She did her best: she came early to anoint my body for burial.
Mark,14,9,"For real, listen up fam, wherever this good news spreads worldwide, people will also talk about what this girl did as a way to remember her."
Mark,14,10,"So, Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve homies, went over to the chief priests, low-key planning to snitch on Jesus to them."
Mark,14,11,"And when they heard that, they were stoked and agreed to slide him some cash. And he tried to figure out a slick way to backstab him."
Mark,14,12,"On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his squad asked him, 'Yo, where should we go to get everything ready for you to have the passover meal?'}"
Mark,14,13,"So Jesus picked two of his homies and said, 'Yo, go into the city and you'll see a dude rocking a water jug. Just chill and follow him.'"
Mark,14,14,"And wherever he goes, tell the owner of the house, The Boss says, where's the chill spot for us to have the Passover feast with my crew?"
Mark,14,15,"And he's gonna show you this awesome, decked-out upper room: it's totally ready for us, so let's get it set up there!"
Mark,14,16,"So like, Jesus and his squad dipped into the city and actually found everything just like he said. They got everything set up for the passover celebration, you know?"
Mark,14,17,And at night he rolls up with his squad of twelve.
Mark,14,18,"And like, while they were chilling and munching, Jesus was like, for real, I'm telling y'all, one of y'all who's eating with me is gonna betray me."
Mark,14,19,"And they were like, totally bummed out, and started asking him individually, 'Is it... like... is it me?' and one of them was like, 'Yo, is it me too?'"
Mark,14,20,"And he was like, yo, it's one of the twelve homies who be dippin' in the same dish as me."
Mark,14,21,"The Son of man is totally heading out, just like people said he would: but OMG, it's like a major bummer for the dude who's gonna betray him! It would legit be better for that guy if he never even existed."
Mark,14,22,"And while they were eating, Jesus grabbed some bread, said a prayer, and broke it into pieces. Then He handed it to them and said, 'Here, take a bite: this is my body.'"
Mark,14,23,"And yo, he grabbed the cup, and after he blessed it, he passed that thing to them: and everybody sipped it."
Mark,14,24,"And he was like, yo listen up y'all, this is my blood, representin' the new covenant 'n stuff, like it's gonna be spilled for so many peeps."
Mark,14,25,"Seriously, listen up, I'm telling you that I won't be sipping any more grape juice until the day I get to sip it fresh in God's kingdom."
Mark,14,26,"After jamming out to a lit hymn, they dipped to the mount of Olives. 🔥💃"
Mark,14,27,"And Jesus is like, yo, all y'all gonna be shook because of me tonight: 'cause it's been written, I'm gonna mess with the leader and the squad gonna scatter. {offended: or, scandalized, or, shall stumble}"
Mark,14,28,"But after I come back to life, I'll head to Galilee before you do."
Mark,14,29,"But Peter was like, 'Bro, even if everyone else dips out, I am so NOT gonna bail on you.'"
Mark,14,30,"And Jesus was like, yo dude, listen up. I'm telling you straight up, today, even tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you're gonna deny me three times."
Mark,14,31,"But he like totally said even more loudly, if I had to go down with you, there's no way I'm gonna pretend like I don't know you. All the others were like, same, dude."
Mark,14,32,"So they arrived at this spot called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his crew, 'Yo, chill here while I take a moment to pray.'"
Mark,14,33,"And he's like, yo, he brings Peter, James, and John with him, and he starts to be super shocked and really sad;"
Mark,14,34,"And He's like, 'Yo, guys, my soul is seriously hurting to the point where I feel like I'm dying. Can you just stay here with me and keep an eye out?"
Mark,14,35,"Then he moved up a bit, dropped to the ground, and prayed that, if it could happen, the tough time could be avoided."
Mark,14,36,"And he was like, 'Yo, Dad, you can totally do anything; if it's possible, please don't make me go through this tough time, but ultimately, I trust your plan more than my own.'"
Mark,14,37,"So he comes and sees them sleeping, and says to Peter, 'Simon, are you seriously sleeping? Couldn't you stay up for just one hour?'"
Mark,14,38,"Yo, stay woke and pray, or you gonna fall into temptation. Like, the soul is all down, but the body be weak, you feel me?"
Mark,14,39,"Then he dipped out again, took a moment to vibe, and said the exact same stuff."
Mark,14,40,"And like, when he came back, he saw them all dozing off again, (because they were hella tired,) and they didn't even know how to respond to him."
Mark,14,41,"And he comes back for the third time, and he's like, 'Y'all can go ahead and keep sleeping and chilling now. We're good. The time has come, check it out - the Son of man is about to be handed over to a bunch of sinners.'"
Mark,14,42,"Let's bounce, y'all! Watch out, the one who's about to betray me is right here."
Mark,14,43,"And, like right away, while he was still talking, Judas shows up, one of the twelve, and he brings a huge crowd armed with swords and clubs. They're all from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders."
Mark,14,44,"And the one who snaked him out gave them a heads up, like, 'I'll give a smooch to the person who's the target; that's the one, grab 'em and make sure they're safe."
Mark,14,45,"And when he arrived, he went straight to him and said, 'Sup, dude?' and gave him a fist bump."
Mark,14,46,And they grabbed him and took him away.
Mark,14,47,"Then this dude next to Jesus straight up pulls out a sword and slashes the high priest's servant, chopping off his ear. No chill at all."
Mark,14,48,"And Jesus was like, yo, why y'all pullin' up on me like I'm some kinda criminal, armed with swords and sticks?"
Mark,14,49,"I was with you every day teaching in the temple, but you didn't pay attention to me. However, the scriptures had to be fulfilled."
Mark,14,50,"And then, like, they all totally abandoned him and, like, ran away."
Mark,14,51,"There was this young dude who was rockin' a cool linen cloth outfit around his body, and then some other young dudes grabbed him."
Mark,14,52,"And he ditched his robe and bolted away from them, butt naked."
Mark,14,53,"So they brought Jesus to the high priest, and all the top priests, old dudes, and smart guys gathered there too."
Mark,14,54,"And Peter was like, chilling at the back, following Jesus as he entered the high priest's palace. He decided to hang out with the servants there and warm himself up near the fire."
Mark,14,55,"So, like, the head priests and the entire council were trying to find someone to testify against Jesus and get him killed. But, yo, they couldn't find anyone!"
Mark,14,56,"Like, a lot of people straight up lied about him, but their stories didn't match up."
Mark,14,57,"Then some people came forward and gave fake testimony against him, like,"
Mark,14,58,"We heard him say, like, 'Yo, I'm gonna wreck this temple that's man-made and then, in like three days, I'll build a new one that's all divine and spiritual, dude.'"
Mark,14,59,"But, like, their testimony didn't match up or whatever."
Mark,14,60,"So the high priest gets up and is like, 'Yo Jesus, you got anything to say? These people are throwing accusations at you, man.'"
Mark,14,61,"But he kept quiet and didn't say anything. Then the high priest asked him again, 'Are you the chosen one, the Son of the Blessed?'"
Mark,14,62,"And Jesus was like, yup it's me, and y'all gonna peep the Son of man chillin' on the right hand of power, rollin' in on those heavenly clouds."
Mark,14,63,"Then the high priest was, like, so done with this, and he's all like, 'Why do we even need more people to testify?'"
Mark,14,64,"So you heard the blasphemy, what's your take? And they all decided he should face the death penalty."
Mark,14,65,"Then some people started spitting on him and covering his face, while others were slapping him and taunting him, saying, 'Guess what's coming next, Mr. Prophet?' And the staff members were smacking him with the palms of their hands."
Mark,14,66,"So, Peter was chilling downstairs in the high priest's crib, when suddenly, one of the maid squad showed up:"
Mark,14,67,"And when she peeped Peter getting cozy, she checked him out and said, 'So you were rollin' with Jesus of Nazareth too.'"
Mark,14,68,"But he was like, nah, I don't know what you're talking about, can't relate. Then he dipped out to the porch and suddenly, that rooster started making some noise."
Mark,14,69,"Then a girl spotted him once more and started telling the people nearby, 'Yo, this dude is totally one of them!'"
Mark,14,70,"And he was like, 'Nah fam, not me.' But then a few minutes later, the people around him were like, 'Yo Peter, we know it's you. Your accent totally gives you away as a Galilean.'"
Mark,14,71,"But he started using foul language and was like, 'I have no clue who this dude is that you're talking about.'"
Mark,14,72,"And the second time the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered what Jesus had told him, that before the rooster crows twice, he would deny Jesus three times. And when he thought about it, he couldn't hold back his tears. {or, he cried a lot, or, he started to cry}"
Mark,15,1,"And like, right away in the morning, the big-shot priests had, like, this serious convo with the oldies and smarties and the whole council. They totally restrained Jesus, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"And Pilate was like, 'Are you the King of the Jews or what?' And Jesus was like, 'You said it, man.'"
Mark,15,3,"The top priests threw a bunch of accusations at him, but he stayed silent, not giving them a single word."
Mark,15,4,"Pilate asked him again, like, 'Bro, aren't you gonna answer? Look at how many accusations they're throwing at you!'"
Mark,15,5,"But Jesus still didn't say anything, and Pilate was like, wow, totally surprised."
Mark,15,6,"So during that lit festival, he was like, 'Imma drop a prisoner for y'all, whoever you want.'"
Mark,15,7,"There was this dude named Barabbas, who was chillin' with the gang that caused a ruckus. He straight up killed someone during all the chaos."
Mark,15,8,"And the crowd, like, totally started yelling and wanting him to do the same awesome stuff he always did for them."
Mark,15,9,"But Pilate was like, 'Yo, do you guys want me to let go of the King of the Jews or what?'"
Mark,15,10,Because he knew that the head priests had handed him over out of pure jealousy.
Mark,15,11,But the head religious dudes convinced the crowd to choose Barabbas instead and let him go.
Mark,15,12,"So Pilate responded again and said to them, 'What do y'all want me to do with this guy y'all claim is the King of the Jews?'"
Mark,15,13,"And they were like, 'Bruh, crucify him again.'"
Mark,15,14,"Bruh, Pilate was like, 'Yo, why y'all hatin'? What did this dude even do wrong?' But they straight up started yelling even louder, 'Nah, nail him to the cross!'"
Mark,15,15,"So, like, Pilate, wanting to please the masses, let Barabbas go free, and handed Jesus over to be beaten and crucified."
Mark,15,16,"And the soldiers took him to the Praetorium, which was like a fancy meeting place, and they gathered all their squad there. {Praetorium: kinda like a palace or important hall of audience}"
Mark,15,17,"Then they dressed him up in swaggy purple clothes, and fashioned a crown made of prickly thorns, and placed it on his head,"
Mark,15,18,"And they were like, 'Yo, what's up, King of the Jews!'"
Mark,15,19,"Then they like, hit him on the head with a reed, totally spat on him, and like, bent their knees to worship him."
Mark,15,20,"And, like, after they like totally made fun of him, they, like, stripped him of his purple robe and put his regular clothes back on him. Then they, like, took him out to be crucified, which was, like, super harsh, you know?"
Mark,15,21,"So, like, they made this guy named Simon, from a place called Cyrene, carry Jesus' cross. He was just minding his own business, coming from out of town and stuff. Oh, and Simon's the dad of two dudes named Alexander and Rufus."
Mark,15,22,"So they take him to this spot called Golgotha, which means 'The place of a skull.'"
Mark,15,23,"And they gave him this drink that was like wine mixed with myrrh, but he didn't want it."
Mark,15,24,"And like, when they totally crucified him, they like divided his clothes, you know, by casting lots to see who would get what."
Mark,15,25,"So, like, it was around 9 in the morning when they totally nailed him to the cross."
Mark,15,26,"And they put a sign above him with the words, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Mark,15,27,"And like, they totally crucify two criminals with him, ya know, one on his right side and the other on his left side."
Mark,15,28,"And the prediction came true, just as it was said, and he was hanging out with the troublemakers."
Mark,15,29,"And the people who walked by started dissing him, shaking their heads, and were like, 'Yo, you think you can tear down the temple and rebuild it in just three days?'"
Mark,15,30,"Just, like, save yourself, dude, and like, get down from the cross or something."
Mark,15,31,"And just like the boss priests were totally dissing him, talking trash with their crew, saying, 'Oh, he can save other people, but he can't even save himself.'"
Mark,15,32,"Yo, if this Jesus dude is really the King of Israel, he needs to bounce off that cross ASAP. Then maybe we'll be convinced and start believing. But yo, those other dudes who got crucified with him, straight up dissed him."
Mark,15,33,"And like, when it was, like, 6 PM, dudes, the entire land was, like, covered in total darkness until, like, 9 PM."
Mark,15,34,"And like, at 3pm, Jesus like shouted really loudly, He was all like, 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?' and that means, 'OMG, OMG, why did you like leave me hanging, God?'"
Mark,15,35,"And like, some of the people who were there, when they heard it, were like, dude, he's totally calling for Elias!"
Mark,15,36,"Someone quickly grabbed a sponge and filled it with vinegar. They put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink, saying, 'Hold up; let's see if Elijah will come to rescue him.'"
Mark,15,37,"And Jesus straight up yelled at the top of his lungs, and then totally surrendered his spirit."
Mark,15,38,"And the curtain in the temple like, totally split in half from the highest point to the lowest point, dude."
Mark,15,39,"And, like, when the centurion, who was, like, standing right in front of him, saw him, like, screaming and then, like, dying or whatever, he was like, 'Dude, no doubt this guy was, like, totally the Son of God.'"
Mark,15,40,"There were these girls chillin' from a distance: Mary Magdalene, Mary (the homie of James and Joses), and Salome;"
Mark,15,41,"(And, like, when he was in Galilee, they totally followed him and were like, helping him out and stuff;) and there were a bunch of other girls who were, like, hanging with him and came with him to Jerusalem."
Mark,15,42,"And now, when evening came, since it was the day before the chill day, which is the day before the day of rest,"
Mark,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, a really respectable counselor who was totally stoked about God's kingdom, straight up rolled into Pilate's place, and asked him to hook him up with Jesus' body."
Mark,15,44,"Pilate was like, 'Whoa, is he dead already?' So he called over the centurion and straight up asked him if Jesus had been dead for a minute."
Mark,15,45,"And once the centurion found out about it, he handed over the body to Joseph."
Mark,15,46,"Then he went and got some fancy linen, carefully wrapped him in it, and placed him in a stone tomb that was carved out of a rock. Finally, he rolled a big ol' stone to seal the entrance of the tomb."
Mark,15,47,And Mary Magdalene and Mary (the mother) of Joses saw where he was buried.
Mark,16,1,"After the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary (the super cool mom of James), and Salome went to buy some sweet spices so they could come and give Jesus a special anointing."
Mark,16,2,"And super early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they rolled up to the tomb right when the sun was starting to come up."
Mark,16,3,"And they were like, yo, how are we gonna move that huge stone blocking the tomb entrance tho?"
Mark,16,4,"And, like, when they checked it out, they saw that the huge stone had been rolled away or whatever. It was, like, crazy big, yeah."
Mark,16,5,"As they went inside the tomb, they saw this awesome young dude chilling on the right side, wearing a super long white robe. And let me tell you, they were totally shook!"
Mark,16,6,"And he's like, yo don't freak out, guys! I know you're looking for Jesus from Nazareth, the dude who got crucified. Well, guess what? He's alive! He ain't here anymore. Check out where they laid him, but he's totally not there anymore!"
Mark,16,7,"Yo, like, go and spread the word to his disciples and Peter that he's heading to Galilee ahead of y'all. That's where you'll see him, just like he told you, fam."
Mark,16,8,"And they dipped outta there real fast, like, sprinted away from the tomb; 'cause they were freaked out and in shock: they didn't say a word to anyone, 'cause they were scared AF."
Mark,16,9,"So, like, super early on the first day of the week, Jesus showed up and, get this, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene. You know, the girl who had been dealing with seven whole devils before Jesus cast them out. No biggie."
Mark,16,10,"And she like totally went and told her squad who had been chilling with him, while they were all like mad sad and crying."
Mark,16,11,"And like, when they found out that he was alive and that she saw him, they totally didn't believe it. Ugh, so hard to convince them, you know?"
Mark,16,12,"Then he like totally showed up to two of them in a whole different form while they were walking, and they all went out into the countryside."
Mark,16,13,"So they went and told the rest, but they didn't believe them."
Mark,16,14,"Later, he showed up to the squad while they were vibing and called them out for being skeptical and closed-minded. They didn't believe the ones who saw him after he came back from the dead. {at meat: or, together}"
Mark,16,15,"So, like, he told them, 'Yo, go out into the whole world and spread the good news to every living being, you know?"
Mark,16,16,"If you truly vibe with the faith and get baptized, you'll be saved. But if you don't believe, well... sorry dude, damnation awaits."
Mark,16,17,"And like, if you believe in me, you'll totally see some sick signs. You'll be able to totally banish the evil spirits and speak in, like, totally rad new languages, man."
Mark,16,18,"They'll handle snakes like it's no biggie; and if they accidentally sip on something deadly, it won't even faze them; they'll lay their hands on the sick, and watch them bounce back like magic."

Luke,1,6,"And they were both totally on point, living their best lives before God, following all of the Lord's rules and instructions flawlessly."
Luke,1,7,"And yo, Elizabeth couldn't have no kids 'cause she was barren, and both of them were getting up there in age."
Luke,1,8,"And like, this dude was doing his priest thing and all, you know, doing his duties for God, all according to the schedule and stuff,"
Luke,1,9,"So, like, it was the tradition for the priests to burn incense when they entered the temple of the Lord, you know?"
Luke,1,10,"And like, everyone in the crowd was totally praying outside while the incense was lit."
Luke,1,11,"So, like, this angel from the Lord pops up right next to him by the altar where they burn the incense."
Luke,1,12,"And when Zacharias saw that dude, he totally freaked out, and fear just straight up overwhelmed him."
Luke,1,13,"But the angel was like, 'Chill, Zacharias! Your prayer has been answered, and your wife Elisabeth is gonna have a baby boy. You gotta name him John.'"
Luke,1,14,And you'll totally have a blast and be stoked; a bunch of people will be hype when this baby pops into the scene.
Luke,1,15,"Yo, this dude gonna be mad respected by the Lord, and he ain't gonna be getting lit or anything; he gonna be filled with the Holy Ghost from the time he still in his mom's belly."
Luke,1,16,And he will help many of the kids from Israel to find God.
Luke,1,17,"And he's gonna come before him with the same vibe and energy as Elijah, to help dads connect with their kids and to guide the rebellious towards the wise ways of the righteous. He's gonna prepare the people for the Lord's arrival."
Luke,1,18,"Zacharias was like, 'Yo angel, how can I be sure about this? I'm old AF, and my wife is ancient too.'"
Luke,1,19,"And the angel replied, 'I'm Gabriel, like, I'm literally chilling right in God's presence and He sent me to tell you about some seriously awesome news, dude.'"
Luke,1,20,"Yo, check it out, you're gonna be speechless and unable to talk until all these things I mentioned actually happen. It's because you don't really trust what I'm saying, but don't worry, my words will definitely come true at the right time."
Luke,1,21,"And the crowd was waiting for Zacharias, and they were amazed at how long he was taking in the temple."
Luke,1,22,"And when he came out, he couldn't even talk to them. They could tell he had just seen something mind-blowing in the temple. He tried to signal to them, but all that came out was silence."
Luke,1,23,"And so, when his time of doing his thing was finished, he bounced back to his crib."
Luke,1,24,"So, like, after some time, Elizabeth, his wife, got pregnant and went into hiding for five months, keeping it on the down low, ya know? She was all like,"
Luke,1,25,"This is how God has helped me during the time when He paid attention to me, so that my shame would be gone in front of others."

Luke,1,29,"And like, when she saw {him}, she was totally shook by what he said, and she started thinking like, 'What kind of greeting is this supposed to be?'"
Luke,1,30,"The angel was like, 'Chill, Mary! God totally approves of you, no need to stress.'"
Luke,1,31,"Yo, listen up! Imma drop some news on you. You're gonna get pregnant and have a baby boy. And guess what? You gotta name him JESUS."

Luke,1,37,"Bruh, like, with God, nothing is even off-limits. It's literally all possible, you know?"
Luke,1,38,"Mary was like, yo, I'm all in to be a servant of the Lord, do whatever you said. And then the angel dipped."
Luke,1,39,"So Mary was like, 'Yo, it's go time!' and she bounced to the hills like super fast, heading to this city called Juda."
Luke,1,40,"So I went to Zacharias' crib and said 'Yo, what's up Elisabeth.'"

Luke,1,42,"And she like, totally shouted with a mega voice, and was like, you're the absolute luckiest chick ever, and your baby is like, so blessed."

Luke,1,44,"Yo, like, the moment your greeting hit my ears, the baby in my belly straight up did a happy dance!"
Luke,1,45,"And yo, shoutout to the chica who trusted the process, 'cause what the Lord said would go down is about to go down. Believe that."

Luke,1,55,"Like, he said this to our fam, to Abraham, and to his fam for all time."
Luke,1,56,"So Mary hung out with her for like three months, and then she went back to her own crib."

Luke,1,61,"And they were like, 'Yo, nobody in your fam goes by that name, fam.'"

Luke,2,3,"And everyone had to go get taxed, going back to their own city."
Luke,2,4,"So, Joseph, like, left Galilee, where Nazareth is, and went to this place called Bethlehem in Judaea. He did that because, you know, he was part of David's family line and all that."
Luke,2,5,"So, Mary and her soon-to-be husband Joseph were like, totally caught up in all this government tax business. And BTW, Mary was actually preggers and about to have a baby.

Luke,2,7,"And she like, gave birth to her firstborn, right? And she wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and placed him in, like, a manger, cause there wasn't any space for them in the inn."
Luke,2,8,"So, there were these shepherds hanging out in the fields, you know, just chilling and looking after their sheep during the night. #NightShift #SheepSquad"
Luke,2,9,"Yo, suddenly this angel from the Lord shows up and starts shining God's glory all around them. And lemme tell ya, they were totally scared."

Luke,2,13,"Then out of nowhere, the angel brought along a whole squad from heaven, hyping up and giving mad props to God, and they were like,"
Luke,2,14,"Praise God, high vibes all the way, and on earth, let's spread peace and love to everyone."
Luke,2,15,"So, like, right after the angels were like, peacee out' and went back to heaven, the shepherds were like, 'Yo, let's go check out this crazy thing the Lord told us about, going down in Bethlehem.'"
Luke,2,16,"So they like, rushed over and found Mary, Joseph, and the cute little baby just chillin' in a manger."
Luke,2,17,"And when they saw what happened, they spread the word about the amazing things they were told about this awesome child, you know?"
Luke,2,18,"And everybody who heard it was mind-blown by what the shepherds were saying, like, seriously."

Luke,2,20,"And the shepherds were totally hyped when they went back, shouting out and giving mad props to God for everything they had seen and heard, just like they were told. 🙌🔥"
Luke,2,21,"So, like, after waiting for eight days for the child's circumcision, they finally gave him the name JESUS, which was actually the name that the angel told them before he was even conceived in the womb."
Luke,2,22,"And once her time of purification, as required by the law of Moses, was over, they took him to Jerusalem to introduce him to the Lord."
Luke,2,23,"(As it's written in the ancient Lord's rules, every dude born first will be considered super sacred to the Lord;)"
Luke,2,24,"And like, they had to make this sacrifice as the law of the Lord says, right? It was like, either a couple of turtledoves or two young pigeons, you know?"
Luke,2,25,"Yo, there was this dude in Jerusalem named Simeon, and let me tell you, he was legit righteous and devoted. He was all about waiting for the hope and encouragement of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was totally with him."
Luke,2,26,And the Holy Ghost straight up told him that he wouldn't kick the bucket until he laid eyes on the Lord's chosen one.
Luke,2,27,"And he rolled into the temple all spirit-like, and when the parents brought in baby Jesus, to follow the law's tradition for him,"
Luke,2,28,"And then he picked him up and gave thanks to God and said,"
Luke,2,29,"Yo, God, it's time for your servant to bounce in peace, just like you said:"
Luke,2,30,"I've totally just witnessed your epic salvation, dude."

Luke,2,33,Joseph and his mom were totally shook by what people were saying about him.
Luke,2,34,"And Simeon was like, 'Yo, Mary, listen up. This kid right here? He's gonna be a game-changer for a lot of folks in Israel. He's gonna make some rise up and others fall. Plus, he's gonna be a sign that gets mad shade thrown at him.'"
Luke,2,35,"Lol, like, a sword's gonna totally stab your soul too, to expose what peeps are really thinking."
Luke,2,36,"There was this super wise woman named Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, repping the tribe of Aser. She had lived a pretty long life and had been married for seven years after losing her v-card."
Luke,2,37,"This woman was like, a widow for like eighty-four years and she was always hanging out at the temple, you know? She was super dedicated to serving God and spent her time fasting and praying, like, all the time - day and night!"
Luke,2,38,"And right then, as soon as she walked in, she gave mad props to the Lord, and started talking about him to everyone who was waiting for some epic redemption in Jerusalem. {Jerusalem: or, Israel}"
Luke,2,39,"And once they had completed everything in accordance with the Lord's teachings, they headed back to their hometown, Nazareth, in Galilee."
Luke,2,40,"And the kid grew up, totally rocking that spiritual vibe, overflowing with mad wisdom: and God's grace was totally on point with him."
Luke,2,41,"So, like, every year, this dude's parents would go to Jerusalem to celebrate the passover feast."
Luke,2,42,"So, like, when he was twelve years old, they, you know, went up to Jerusalem for this, like, feast thing."
Luke,2,43,"And after they had finished their time there, on their way back, Jesus, the child, stayed behind in Jerusalem, but Joseph and Mary were unaware of this."
Luke,2,44,"So they thought he was with them, and they traveled for a whole day. They tried to find him among their family and friends."
Luke,2,45,"And, like, when they couldn't find him, they totally turned around and went back to Jerusalem, like, trying to locate him."
Luke,2,46,"So, like, after three days, they finally found him in the temple, just chilling with the doctors, you know? He was totally listening to them and throwing out some questions too."
Luke,2,47,Everyone was blown away by how smart and on point his responses were.
Luke,2,48,"And when they saw him, they were shook: and his mom was like, dude, why you gotta do us like that? Like, your dad and I were so worried, searching for you everywhere."
Luke,2,49,"And he was like, yo, why were you looking for me? Didn't you know I had to be doing my dad's work?"
Luke,2,50,"And they, like, totally didn't get what he was saying and stuff."
Luke,2,51,"So he went with them to Nazareth and obeyed them like a boss. And his mom, she kept all these wise words close to her heart."
Luke,2,52,"And Jesus, like, totally became smarter and grew up and was well-liked by God and people and stuff. {stature: or, age}"
Luke,3,1,"So, like, it was the fifteenth year when Tiberius Caesar was ruling, and Judaea had Pontius Pilate as governor, while Galilee had Herod as the boss, and his brother Philip was in charge of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Abilene had Lysanias as its big shot. (P.S.: By the way, tetrarch just means governor of four provinces.)"
Luke,3,2,"When Annas and Caiaphas were running the show as high priests, God hit up John, Zacharias' son, out in the wild."
Luke,3,3,"And he went all around the area near the Jordan, spreading the word about getting baptized to turn your life around and have your sins forgiven;"
Luke,3,4,"Like, it's written in this book by Esaias the prophet, saying, there's this one voice yelling out in the middle of nowhere, saying, yo, get ready for the Lord, make sure his paths are clear and ready to go."
Luke,3,5,"Yo, listen up! It's like this: Every valley's gonna get filled, all the mountains and hills are gonna be brought down low. And those twisty paths? Boom, straightened out. Oh, and those bumpy roads? Smooth ride ahead, my dudes!"
Luke,3,6,"And everyone will witness God's epic redemption, no cap."
Luke,3,7,"Yo, listen up, everyone who came to get baptized by this dude. Y'all are like a bunch of sneaky snakes, I mean, seriously, who told you to run away from the impending fury and all?"
Luke,3,8,"So, like, produce fruit that shows you're truly sorry for your mistakes. Don't just be all like, 'Oh, we're Abraham's descendants, so we're automatically good.' Seriously, listen up, cuz this is important: God can totally turn some random rocks into Abraham's descendants if He wants to. Don't forget that. Just saying."
Luke,3,9,"And yo, listen up, the axe is straight up about to chop all them weak trees at the root. So any tree that ain't producing good fruit? Yeah, it's getting chopped down and tossed into the fire. No room for Sorry-Excuses Ville here, fam."
Luke,3,10,"So, like, the people were all like, 'Yo, dude, what should we do now?'"
Luke,3,11,"He responds and says to them, if you've got two jackets, share one with someone who ain't got any; and if you've got food, do the same."
Luke,3,12,"So, like, even the tax collectors showed up to get baptized, and they were all like, 'Hey, teacher, what's the dealio? What should we be doing?'"
Luke,3,13,"Yo, listen up fam, don't be tryna hustle more than what you're supposed to, you feel me?"
Luke,3,14,"The soldiers asked him, 'So, what's the deal? What should we do?' And he replied, 'Listen up, don't go around hurting people or falsely accusing them. Just be satisfied with what you're getting paid.'"
Luke,3,15,"So, like, everyone was totally hyped up and wondering in their hearts about John. They were all, like, debating whether he was the chosen one, you know? It was totally suspenseful, like they couldn't wait to find out!"
Luke,3,16,"John was like, 'Listen up, everyone! I may dunk you all in water, but there's someone way more powerful than me on the way. I'm not even worthy to untie his shoelaces! He's gonna drench you with the Holy Spirit and set you on fire, not literally though!'"
Luke,3,17,"He's got a fan in his hand, and he's gonna totally clean up his place. He'll bring all the good stuff together, but he's gonna burn all the worthless stuff with unstoppable fire."
Luke,3,18,"And he dropped so much wisdom and motivation in his talk to the crowd, it was unreal."
Luke,3,19,"But bruh, Herod the tetrarch got called out by him for being with Herodias, who was his brother Philip's girl. And he got called out for all the messed up stuff Herod had been doin', too."
Luke,3,20,"And on top of everything, he put John in jail."
Luke,3,21,"So, like, when everyone was getting baptized, Jesus was like, 'yeah, I'm gonna get baptized too,' and while he was praying, the sky just opened up, ya know?"
Luke,3,22,"Then the Holy Ghost came down on Jesus like a dove in a physical form, and a voice from heaven said, 'You're my fave Son, I'm totally stoked with you.'"
Luke,3,23,"So Jesus was like around 30 years old, people thought he was Joseph's son, who was Heli's son."

Luke,4,2,"So, like, Jesus was out in the desert for, like, 40 days and the devil was totally trying to mess with him. And during that time, Jesus didn't eat anything, but once those days were done, he was super hungry!"
Luke,4,3,"Then the devil was like, 'Yo, if you really are God's Son, why don't you flex and turn this rock into bread?'"
Luke,4,4,"And Jesus replied, saying, like, man cannot survive on bread alone, but needs every word of God to thrive."
Luke,4,5,"And the devil, like, totally takes him up to this huge mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world in, like, a split second."

Luke,4,24,"And he was like, for real, listen up, no prophet gets embraced in their own hood, ya know?"
Luke,4,25,"Dude, for real though, there were so many widows in Israel back when Elias was doing his thing. It was like the heavens decided to go offline for three and a half years and a massive famine hit the entire land, no joke."
Luke,4,26,"But Elias only went to Sarepta, a city in Sidon, to help a widow lady."
Luke,4,27,"So, like, back in the day when Eliseus was prophet, there were tons of lepers in Israel, you know? But get this, only Naaman, this dude from Syria, actually got cleansed from the leprosy! Like, nobody else, man!"
Luke,4,28,"And everyone in the synagogue, after hearing this, got hella mad,"
Luke,4,29,"So they like, totally drove him out of the city, you know? And then they took him to the edge of this hill where the city was built, with the intention of throwing him down headfirst, like, whaaat?!"
Luke,4,30,"But he just casually walked through them and continued on his own path,"
Luke,4,31,"And like, this dude went to Capernaum, which is like this cool city in Galilee, and started teaching peeps on the sabbath days."
Luke,4,32,And they were shooketh by his teachings: 'cause his words were straight fire.
Luke,4,33,"So, there was this guy in the synagogue who was like possessed by, you know, a wicked, evil spirit. And man, he started screaming at the top of his lungs!"
Luke,4,34,"They were like, 'Leave us alone, man! What's your deal, Jesus of Nazareth? Are you here to wreck us? I totally recognize you, you're the Holy One of God."
Luke,4,35,"Jesus totally shut that guy down, like, 'Shut up and get out of here!' And then no joke, the devil tossed him around, but like, no harm done, 'cause the dude was exorcised, for real."
Luke,4,36,"Dude, everyone was totally mind-blown and started chatting, like, 'Yo, did you hear that word? This guy's got some serious authority and power! He can straight-up command those evil spirits, and they actually bounce out.'"
Luke,4,37,"And like, everyone in the whole area knew about him and was totally talking about him."
Luke,4,38,"Then he left the synagogue and went to Simon's crib. Simon's stepmom was super sick with a major fever, so they begged him to help her out."
Luke,4,39,"Then he like totally stood over her and was like, 'Yo, fever, you need to bounce!' And guess what? The fever like totally bounced, no kidding! And right away, she got up and started helping them out. So rad!"
Luke,4,40,"So, as the sun was going down, all those who had friends with various illnesses brought them to him. And he touched each and every one of them, and cured them."
Luke,4,41,"And a bunch of demons came out of a lot of people. They were freaking out and shouting, saying, 'You're the real deal, Jesus, the Son of God!' But Jesus shut them up and didn't let them say anything because they knew exactly who he was."
Luke,4,42,"When morning came, he left and went to a remote place: and the crowd looked for him, and came to him, and stopped him, not wanting him to leave them."
Luke,4,43,"And he was like, yo guys, I gotta spread the word about God's kingdom to other cities too, 'cause that's why I was sent here, you know?"
Luke,4,44,"And he was like, straight up preaching in all the synagogues in Galilee, you know?"
Luke,5,1,"Yo, this crazy thing happened - the people were all up in his face, wanting to hear the word of God. So, my dude was chillin' by the lake of Gennesaret."
Luke,5,2,"So, there were these two boats chillin' by the lake, but the fishermen had peaced out and were busy cleaning their nets."
Luke,5,3,Then he hopped into Simon's boat and asked him to push away from the shore a bit. He took a seat and started dropping some wisdom bombs to the crowd from the boat.
Luke,5,4,"So, like, when he finished speaking, he was all like, 'Yo, Simon, take your boat to the deep waters and drop your nets to catch some fish, bro.'"
Luke,5,5,"Simon be like, 'Yo, Teacher, we've been grinding all night, but we haven't caught a single thing. But I got faith in you, so I'll drop the net as you say.'"
Luke,5,6,"And yo, when they finished this task, they caught a mad swarm of fish: and their net straight up snapped."
Luke,5,7,"So they like, signaled their homies from the other ship, asking for their help. And, yo, they came through and filled up both the ships, so much so that they started sinking, fam."
Luke,5,8,"When Simon Peter peeped that, he straight up dropped to Jesus' knees, like, 'Yo, homie, you gotta bounce; I'm hella messed up, Lord.'"
Luke,5,9,"Yo, everybody was straight up shook when they peeped the mad haul of fish that they just scored."
Luke,5,10,"And same goes for James and John, the sons of Zebedee, they were like BFFs with Simon. And Jesus was like, 'Yo, Simon, don't stress out, bro. From now on, you're gonna be reeling in people, not fish.'"
Luke,5,11,"And after they docked their ships, they left everything behind and started following him."
Luke,5,12,"So, like, Jesus was chilling in this city, right? Suddenly, this guy with a bad case of leprosy spots him and, like, straight-up falls on his face in front of Jesus, begging him, 'Yo, Lord, if you're down, you could totally cure me.'"
Luke,5,13,"And then he reached out and touched him, saying, 'I gotchu, bro. Be fresh and clean.' And just like that, all that leprosy was gone, no cap."
Luke,5,14,"He told him not to tell anyone, but to go and show himself to the priest and offer the proper offering for cleansing, as Moses commanded, to serve as a testimony for them."
Luke,5,15,But word quickly spread about him and tons of people gathered around to listen and get healed by him from their sicknesses.
Luke,5,16,Then he went off on his own to a remote place and spent some quality time praying.
Luke,5,17,"One day, while he was teaching, there were Pharisees and legal experts from all over Galilee, Judaea, and Jerusalem sitting there. The power of the Lord was there to heal them."
Luke,5,18,"Yo, check it out, these guys brought in a dude on a bed who had a serious case of palsy. They were totally determined to bring him inside and lay him in front of Jesus."
Luke,5,19,"So, like, these guys were dealing with a huge crowd and couldn't figure out how to get their bro inside, ya know? Well, they had this big brain idea and decided to go up on the roof and lower him through the tiles on his bed right in front of Jesus. Epic move, right?!"
Luke,5,20,"And when he saw how strong they believed, he was like, 'Dude, your mistakes are totally forgiven.'"
Luke,5,21,"So the religious dudes and the self-righteous Pharisees started yapping, like, who does this guy think he is, talking all blasphemous and stuff? Only God can forgive sins, everyone knows that!"
Luke,5,22,"Yo, when Jesus peeped their thoughts, he straight up responded like, 'What's the deal with y'all's mind game? Like, seriously, what's the plan?'"
Luke,5,23,"Like, seriously, which is, like, easier? To be all like, 'Dude, I forgive you for your sins' or to be all like, 'Yo, get up and start walking'?"
Luke,5,24,"So, just to let you all know, the Son of man has some serious power to forgive sins here on earth. He straight up said to the sick person with paralysis, 'Listen up, my dude. I'm telling you, get up, grab your mat, and head on home.'"
Luke,5,25,"And right away, he got up in front of them, grabbed his stuff, and headed back to his crib, praising God."
Luke,5,26,"Yo, everyone was totally shook and they started praising God like crazy. They were so freaked out, like, 'Dude, we just witnessed some seriously mind-blowing stuff today!'"
Luke,5,27,"And then this dude went out, and peeped a tax collector, named Levi, chillin' at the cash register: and he was like, 'Yo, come vibe with me.'"
Luke,5,28,"And he just ditched everything, got up, and straight up started rollin' with him."
Luke,5,29,"So, Levi threw a lit party at his crib and a bunch of tax collectors and other homies rolled through and chilled with them."
Luke,5,30,"But yo, these scribes and Pharisees were trippin' on his disciples, like, why y'all eatin' and drinkin' with tax collectors and straight-up sinners?"
Luke,5,31,"Yo, Jesus be like, 'Listen up y'all! Healthy peeps don't need a doctor, but sick peeps do!'"
Luke,5,32,"Yo, I didn't slide in here to give the goodie-goodies a shoutout. Nah, I'm here to hit up the sinners and get 'em to turn their lives around."
Luke,5,33,"And they were like, yo, why do John's followers fast all the time and pray a lot, and the Pharisees' followers too, but your squad just chill and eat and drink?"
Luke,5,34,"And he was like, yo, can you guys expect the squad to do intermittent fasting while the groom is vibing with them?"
Luke,5,35,"Yo, there's gonna be a time when the groom gets taken away from the crew, and they're gonna fast during those days."
Luke,5,36,"So, Jesus told them this story: You don't patch up an old piece of clothing using a new piece. If you do, the new piece will ruin the old one and they won't match at all."
Luke,5,37,"You can't pour fresh juice into old containers, 'cause the juice will make 'em burst and spill everywhere, and the containers will just totally wreck."
Luke,5,38,But you gotta pour the fresh juice into trendy containers; 'cause that's how you keep both of 'em on fleek.
Luke,5,39,"No cap, if you've already tasted that vintage {wine}, you ain't gonna be craving something new right away. You'll be like, 'Nah, the old stuff hits different, it's superior'."
Luke,6,1,"So, like, on the second sabbath after the first, Jesus and his squad were like walking through this corn field. And they were hungry, so they started picking some corn and munching on it, like rubbing the kernels in their hands and getting their snack on."
Luke,6,2,"Hey, some of the Pharisees were like, 'Yo, why are y'all doing stuff that's not allowed on the Sabbath, fam?'"
Luke,6,3,"And Jesus was like, 'Y'all seriously haven't even read about what David did when he was starving and had his squad with him? Like, what's up with that?'"
Luke,6,4,"Yo, this dude walked into the house of God, grabbed some of that sacred bread, and even shared it with his crew. But hold up, that bread was only meant for the priests to eat, you feel me?"
Luke,6,5,"He told them that the Son of man is totally the boss of the sabbath, like, no doubt about it."
Luke,6,6,"One time, on another Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and started teaching. There was this dude there with a messed up right hand."
Luke,6,7,"So, like, these scribes and Pharisees were totally keeping an eye on him, you know, checking if he'd do some healing on the sabbath day. They had this sneaky plan to find something they could accuse him of, like low-key trying to bring him down."
Luke,6,8,"But, like, Jesus totally knew what they were thinking, and he was all like, 'Yo dude with the jacked up hand, get up and show everyone what's up.' And then the guy got up and stood there, chillin' in the middle of the crowd."
Luke,6,9,"So Jesus was like, yo fam, let me drop this question on you: Is it cool to do good or bad stuff on the sabbath? Like, should we save lives or just mess everything up?"
Luke,6,10,"And checking out everyone, he was like to the man, 'Yo, flex your hand.' And he did it, and his hand was all good, just like the other."
Luke,6,11,"And they were so triggered, and started a group chat to brainstorm how they could cancel Jesus."
Luke,6,12,"So, like, one day, he's all like, 'I'm gonna go find myself a chill mountain spot to vibe and pray to God.' And he legit spent the entire night there, just pouring out his heart in prayer."
Luke,6,13,"And when morning came, he dm'd his disciples and selected twelve of them to be squad members, giving them the title of apostles."
Luke,6,14,"Simon, who was also called Peter, and his bro Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,"
Luke,6,15,"So like, there were these dudes named Matthew and Thomas, and also James, who was like the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was also known as Zelotes."
Luke,6,16,"So there were two guys named Judas. One was the brother of James, and the other one was Judas Iscariot, who ended up being the traitor."
Luke,6,17,"So, Jesus came down with his squad and made an entrance on the scene. He was standing in a chill spot, surrounded by his crew and a massive crowd of peeps from all over Judaea, Jerusalem, and the coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon. They were all there to vibe with him, listen to his teachings, and get healed from their sicknesses."
Luke,6,18,And those who were tormented by bad vibes: and they were healed.
Luke,6,19,"And the entire crowd wanted to get close to him because they sensed this incredible energy radiating from him, and he healed everyone."
Luke,6,20,"So, like, Jesus looked up at his crew of followers and said, 'Yo, you guys who are struggling financially, you're totally blessed, 'cause the kingdom of God belongs to you.'"
Luke,6,21,"You guys who are hungry right now are gonna get satisfied, and you guys who are crying right now are gonna end up laughing."
Luke,6,22,"You're totally blessed when people start hating on you, ditching you from their squad, calling you names, and treating you like you're the worst all because you're rocking it for the Son of Man!"
Luke,6,23,"Yo, on that day, straight up celebrate and go wild with joy. Like, check this out: your reward in heaven is gonna be off the charts! 'Cause, you know, even their ancestors treated the prophets the exact same way and they got rewarded too."
Luke,6,24,"But listen up, if you're ballin' in wealth, you better watch out! 'Cause all the satisfaction you gonna get is right here, nothin' more."
Luke,6,25,"Dang, you'll be in for a rude awakening if you think you've got everything figured out! 'Cause believe me, those who are content with their current state will eventually crave more. And oh boy, don't get too carried away with all your laughter and joy in the moment! 'Cause sooner or later, it's gonna flip and you'll find yourselves on the other side, feeling nothing but regret and sadness."
Luke,6,26,"Dang, it’s not a good look when everyone’s just kissing up to you! That’s exactly how their ancestors treated those fake prophets, man."
Luke,6,27,"Yo, listen up! Here's the real talk - love your enemies, show some kindness to those who can't stand you,"
Luke,6,28,"Wishing good vibes upon those who diss you, and sending positive vibes for the haters who treat you badly."
Luke,6,29,"If someone hits you on one cheek, don't be afraid to offer the other cheek as well. And if someone takes your hoodie, don't hold back from giving them your T-shirt too."
Luke,6,30,"If someone asks you for something, just give it to them, and don't demand it back if they take your stuff."
Luke,6,31,"Treat others how you wanna be treated, so give 'em the same vibe."
Luke,6,32,"If you only show love to those who love you back, what's the big deal? Even sinners do that, you know."
Luke,6,33,"And, like, if you only do something nice for people who are nice to you, what's the big deal? Even sinners do that, duh."
Luke,6,34,"And if you lend money to someone with the hope of getting something back, what's so special about that? Even bad people do that, expecting to get back what they gave."
Luke,6,35,"But instead of hating your enemies, show them love, do good to them, and lend a helping hand without expecting anything in return. If you do this, you will receive great blessings and be recognized as children of the most loving One, because He treats even the ungrateful and wicked with kindness."
Luke,6,36,"So, like, be kind and stuff, just like your Dad is kind."
Luke,6,37,"Don't be all judgy, and you won't get judged in return. No need to condemn others, or else you'll face condemnation yourself. Instead, be all about that forgiveness, and you'll receive it too."
Luke,6,38,"Share the love, and it's gonna come right back at ya! Like a massive overflow, people are gonna show you mad love. 'Cause whatever amount of love you dish out, that's the same amount you're gonna get in return, no doubts!"
Luke,6,39,"So, Jesus told them a story, you know? He was like, can the blind peeps lead the other blind peeps? Like, seriously, won't they both end up falling into a ditch or something?"
Luke,6,40,"The homie can't be better than the one who taught 'em: but when you're hella on point, you'll be just as dope as your teacher. {shall be perfected as his master: or, shall be hella perfected like their teacher}"
Luke,6,41,"And why are you so focused on the little thing that bothers you about your bro, but you totally miss the huge thing that's going on with yourself?"
Luke,6,42,"Yo, why you tryna act all high and mighty, telling your bro to let you take out that tiny speck in their eye when you can't even see the huge plank in your own eye? You're straight up being fake, man. Take care of your own issues first, then you'll be able to see clearly and help your bro with their tiny problem."
Luke,6,43,"Like, a totally legit tree doesn't produce garbage fruit, ya know? And, like, a messed up tree doesn't produce awesome fruit either. No cap."
Luke,6,44,"You can totally judge a tree based on its fruit, ya know? Like, you wouldn't expect to find figs on a thorny bush or grapes on a prickly bramble, right? (BTW, 'grapes' in Greek means 'a grape')."
Luke,6,45,"A righteous person, from the good stuff in their heart, brings out good things. But a wicked person, from the bad stuff in their heart, brings out evil things. Because, let's be real, what's in their heart is gonna come out of their mouth."
Luke,6,46,"Why are you like, calling me Lordd, Lord,' but not even doing what I'm telling you to do?"
Luke,6,47,"If anyone comes to me and listens to what I say, and actually does it, I'll show you who they remind me of:"
Luke,6,48,"Imagine this dude who built a sick house. He went all out, digging deep and setting the foundation on a solid rock. Then, when a massive flood came rolling in, the raging waters tried their best to wreck that house, but guess what? They failed! This house was built to last on that rock-solid foundation."
Luke,6,49,"But if you hear the message and don't act on it, it's like a person who builds a house without a strong foundation. When the waves of life come crashing, that house is gonna get wrecked real quick and it's gonna be a huge disaster."
Luke,7,1,"After finishing his speech, in front of all the people, he rolled into Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,"So there was this centurion, right, and he had this servant who was super close to him. But this servant got really sick, like about to kick the bucket kind of sick."
Luke,7,3,"And when he heard about Jesus, he reached out to him through the elders of the Jewish community, asking him to come and heal his servant."
Luke,7,4,"And when they approached Jesus, they earnestly asked him, saying, That he was totally deserving for him to do this:"
Luke,7,5,"Because he really vibes with our nation, and he totally hooked us up with a sick synagogue."
Luke,7,6,"So, Jesus tagged along with them. And when he was getting close to the house, the centurion sent his buddies to talk to him. They were like, 'Yo, Lord, please don't go through the trouble of coming to my place, 'cause I ain't even deserving enough to have you step inside:'"
Luke,7,7,"So, like, I didn't even think I was cool enough to approach you, but just like, say the word and my servant will totally be healed."
Luke,7,8,"So, like, I'm totally a guy who's got authority and stuff. I've got a crew of soldiers under me, and I can just be like, 'Hey, you, go!' and he goes. And I can be like, 'Yo, come here!' and he comes. And even my servant, I just have to say, 'Do this!' and he does it, no questions asked, dude."
Luke,7,9,"When Jesus heard all this, he was totally amazed. He turned around, looked at the crowd following him, and dropped some truth bombs: 'Listen up, peeps! I gotta say, I haven't seen such a massive dose of faith, not even among the cool cats in Israel.'"
Luke,7,10,"When the peeps who were sent came back to the crib, they saw that the homie who was sick is all good now."
Luke,7,11,"The next day, he rolled into this city called Nain, with a crew of his day-ones and a ton of people."
Luke,7,12,"So, like, as he was gettin' close to the city gate, guess what? There was this dead guy being taken out. And get this, he was the only son of his mom who happened to be a widow. And, like, there was a big crowd of people from the city with her."
Luke,7,13,"And when the Lord saw her, he felt for her and said, 'Hey, don't cry.'"
Luke,7,14,"Then he approached the coffin and those carrying it halted. He said, 'Hey dude, listen up, get up!'"
Luke,7,15,The dude who was dead straight up came back to life and started talking. And he totally handed the guy over to his mom.
Luke,7,16,"Everyone was so shook and they started giving mad props to God, saying, 'Yo, a major prophet has appeared in our midst, and God has totally come through for his people.'"
Luke,7,17,"So, like, everyone in Judaea and the whole area heard all about this guy, no lies."
Luke,7,18,So the buddies of John filled him in on all the deets about what went down.
Luke,7,19,"So, John grabs two of his homies and slides into Jesus' DMs. He asks, 'Yo, are you the real deal, or should we be checkin' out someone else?'"
Luke,7,20,"When the guys came up to him, they were like, 'Yo, John the Baptist sent us to you, asking if you're the one we've been waiting for, or should we keep looking?'"
Luke,7,21,"And like, right away, he totally healed so many peeps from all their sicknesses, diseases, and even like, evil spirits, you know? And he legit made lots of blind people see again, like, mind-blowing!"
Luke,7,22,"Yo, Jesus had this sick comeback for them. He was like, 'Alright, you guys go do your thing and tell John what you've witnessed and heard. Like, I'm talking about blind people gaining sight, lame folks straight-up walking, lepers getting cured, deaf peeps hearing again, and even dead people coming back to life! Plus, the good news is spreading like wildfire to help out those who are struggling.'"
Luke,7,23,And cool is anyone who isn't judgmental about me.
Luke,7,24,"So, after John's messengers left, Jesus started talking to the crowd about John. He was like, 'What did you go out in the middle of nowhere to see? A weakling who just goes along with whatever?'"
Luke,7,25,"So, what did you go out to see? A dude dressed in expensive clothes? Well, let me tell you, those who wear fancy outfits and live a luxurious life are the ones you'll find in palaces."
Luke,7,26,"But why did you go see him? Just a prophet? Nah, I'm telling you, he's way more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"Yo, this is {he}, like the one they talked about when they said, 'Yo, check it out, I'm sending my messenger ahead of you to get things ready for you, man.'"
Luke,7,28,"Listen up, fam, I gotta tell you something real important. When it comes to all the peeps poppin' outta women, John the Baptist takes the cake as the top prophet. But check it, even the lowest peep in God's kingdom is greater than him. Just sayin'."
Luke,7,29,"So, like, all the people who heard him and even the ones who were considered 'outcasts' by society, they were like giving props to God, by getting baptized with John's baptism."
Luke,7,30,"But those Pharisees and lawyers straight up ignored God's advice for themselves, cuz they didn't bother to get baptized by him."
Luke,7,31,"And God was like, 'Yo, how can I explain what the people of this era are like? What can I compare them to?'"
Luke,7,32,"It's like kids chilling in the shopping mall, shouting at each other, saying, 'We played some sick tunes, and you didn't even vibe; we tried to get deep with you, and you didn't shed a tear.'"
Luke,7,33,"So like, John the Baptist was all about that no carbs, no booze lifestyle, and y'all go around saying he's possessed by a demon. Smh."
Luke,7,34,"Yo, the Son of man pulled up, chowing down and sippin'; and you be like, 'Check it out, this dude's a total foodie and party animal, always hangin' with tax collectors and chillin' with sinners!'"
Luke,7,35,But being smart is praised by all her kids.
Luke,7,36,"So, this one Pharisee really wanted to hang out and have a meal together. Jesus was all like, 'Sure, why not?' So they ended up going to the Pharisee's crib and chilling while grubbing."
Luke,7,37,"Yo, check it out: there was this chick in the city who had a rep for being a sinner. She found out that Jesus was chilling at a Pharisee's crib, and she had the guts to bring this fancy alabaster box of sweet-smelling ointment."
Luke,7,38,"She came up to him, standing behind him, crying, and started washing his feet with her tears. Then she dried them with her own hair, kissed his feet, and put fragrant oil on them."
Luke,7,39,"So, like, this Pharisee dude who had invited him saw it, right? And he starts having a little self-talk, being all like, 'Yo, if this guy Jesus was a legit prophet, he would totally know that this chick touching him is, like, a huge sinner and stuff.'"
Luke,7,40,"So, like, Jesus was like, 'Yo, Simon, I got something to tell you.' And Simon was all like, 'Oh, Master, go ahead and spill the tea.'"
Luke,7,41,"So, like, there was this creditor who had two debtors. One owed, like, five hundred pence, and the other owed, umm, fifty."
Luke,7,42,"So, like, when they were totally broke, he, like, totally forgave both of them. So, which one do you think will, like, love him the most?"
Luke,7,43,"So Simon was like, 'I guess it's the one who got forgiven the most, duh.' And Jesus was like, 'Yup, you got it right.'"
Luke,7,44,"And he looked at the woman and said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I came into your place and you didn't offer me water for my feet. But she washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her own hair.'"
Luke,7,45,"You didn't even give me a kiss, but this girl hasn't stopped kissing my feet since I walked in."
Luke,7,46,"You didn't even bother to put oil on my head, but this girl went ahead and anointed my feet with some fancy ointment."
Luke,7,47,"So, like honestly, let me break it down for you. Check it - those mistakes she made, yo, they were mad heavy. But listen up, 'cause here's the deal: 'cause she loved hard, her sins got wiped clean, no cap. But if someone hasn't messed up a lot, they ain't gonna show that same kinda love, you feel me?"
Luke,7,48,"And he was like, girl, your sins are totally forgiven."
Luke,7,49,"And the squad who were chilling with him started whispering to each other, like, who does this guy think he is, forgiving sins and all that?"
Luke,7,50,"And he was like, 'Girl, your faith has totally saved you. Go in peace and chill vibes.'"
Luke,8,1,"After that, he went all around every city and town, spreading the good news about God's kingdom. And the twelve disciples were right there with him."
Luke,8,2,"There were some girls who were cured of evil spirits and illnesses, and one of them was named Mary Magdalene, who used to be possessed by seven devils."
Luke,8,3,"And Joanna, who's married to Chuza, the guy in charge under King Herod, and Susanna, and a bunch of other people, they were all like totally supporting him and sharing their stuff with him."
Luke,8,4,"So there were a ton of people who showed up from all over the place, and they came to listen to him. And you know what he did? He started dropping mad knowledge bombs through a cool story:"
Luke,8,5,"So there was this guy, right, who went out to spread his seeds. He tossed 'em everywhere and some ended up on the path where people walked. It got trampled on and the birds swooped in and gobbled it up."
Luke,8,6,"And some fell on a rock; and when it started growing, it dried up because there was no water."
Luke,8,7,"And then, like, some of it fell into this like, patch of thorns and, like, those thorns grew all around it and, like, started suffocating it."
Luke,8,8,"And some fell on really solid ground, and like, totally blew up and produced, like, a ton of fruit. And after saying all that, he shouted, 'Yo, to anyone with ears, pay attention and really listen up!'"
Luke,8,9,"His homies asked him, like, yo Jesus, what's the deal with this story?"
Luke,8,10,"And he was like, yo, you guys are blessed with the knowledge of the secrets of God's kingdom. But for others, he spoke in parables so that they wouldn't really get it when they see or hear it."
Luke,8,11,"So basically, let me break it down for you: the seed is like the word of God, you know what I'm saying?"
Luke,8,12,"The people on the sidelines are the ones who hear, but then the devil swoops in and snatches away the message from their hearts, so they don't have a chance to believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"Those people who stay firm in their beliefs, when they hear the word, accept it with excitement. But they don't have a strong foundation, so their faith doesn't last. When challenges come their way, they end up losing their faith over time."
Luke,8,14,"And the seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who, after hearing the message, get caught up in the stress, the pursuit of wealth, and the pursuit of pleasure in this world. As a result, they don't bear any fruit in the end."
Luke,8,15,"But those who are like the good vibes squad, who have a genuine and positive attitude, and after hearing the truth, hold onto it and produce awesome results with patience."
Luke,8,16,"Yo, bro, when someone lights up a candle, they don't hide it under some random object or shove it under a bed. Nah, they put it on a fancy candle holder, so that everybody who comes in can vibe with the light."
Luke,8,17,"Like, seriously, nothing stays a secret forever, y'know? Everything that's hidden eventually gets exposed and becomes public knowledge. Absolutely nothing will stay hidden forever, trust me, it'll all come out eventually."
Luke,8,18,"Listen up, peeps! Pay close attention to how you listen: 'cause if you've already got something, you'll get even more of it, and if you don't have anything, even what you think you've got will be taken away. Yeah, that's what's up!"
Luke,8,19,"So, like, his mom and his bros came to him, but they couldn't even get to him because of all the crowd, you know?"
Luke,8,20,"Some people came up to him and said, 'Yo, your fam's outside, they wanna chill with you.'"
Luke,8,21,"And he was like, yo, I gotta tell you guys something - my crew, my day ones, are the ones who listen to God's word and actually live it out, ya feel me?"
Luke,8,22,"So one day, he hopped on a ship with his squad and said, 'Let's head to the other side of the lake.' And off they went, setting sail like bosses."
Luke,8,23,"But while they were sailing, he dozed off, and suddenly a crazy storm hit the lake. The boat got swamped with water and they were in serious danger."
Luke,8,24,"So they ran up to him and shook him awake, like, 'Yo, Jesus, bro! We're literally gonna die!' And then he got up and was like, 'Chill out, wind and waves!' And just like that, everything went silent and calm."
Luke,8,25,"And he was like, bro, where's your faith at? And they were legit scared and like, talking amongst themselves, they were like, whoa, who is this guy? He literally has mad power over the wind and water, and they do whatever he says."
Luke,8,26,"So they arrived in the land of the Gadarenes, which is just across from Galilee."
Luke,8,27,"So, when he arrived onshore, this dude from the city came up to him. This guy was possessed by demons for a long time, didn't wear any clothes, and didn't live in a house but in the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he totally freaked out and dropped down in front of him. He yelled at the top of his lungs, 'Dude, why are you messing with me, Jesus, the ultimate Son of God? Please, don't torture me!'"
Luke,8,29,Because he told the evil spirit to leave the guy's body. That spirit would often take over him and he'd be tied up with chains and ropes. But he'd break free and the devil would force him to wander in the wilderness.
Luke,8,30,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, what's your name, bro?' And he was like, 'Legion, cuz there's a whole bunch of demons up in here.'"
Luke,8,31,"So, like, they were begging him not to make them like, go out into the deep, you know?"
Luke,8,32,"So, like, there were a bunch of pigs chilling on the mountain, right? And they were like, 'Yo dude, can we, like, crash in these pigs?' And He was, like, 'Yeah sure, go ahead.'"
Luke,8,33,"So, like, the demons bounced out of the dude and hopped into the pigs: and the whole gang of pigs went totally crazy and rushed down a super steep hill into the lake, and yeah, they couldn't handle it and, like, choked."
Luke,8,34,"When the people who were feeding them saw what happened, they dipped out and spread the word in the city and countryside."
Luke,8,35,"So they went to check out the scene and found Jesus with the guy who had been possessed by demons. He was sitting there, fully dressed and in his right mind. This totally freaked them out!"
Luke,8,36,Those who witnessed it spilled the tea on how he straight up yeeted those demons out and healed the possessed guy like ✨ magician level ✨.
Luke,8,37,"So, like, this big group of peeps from the Gadarenes region were all like, 'Yo, Jesus, can you please dip from our area? 'Cause you kinda freak us out with all your crazy powers.' And then Jesus was like, 'No worries, fam.' He hopped on a nearby boat and sailed on back."
Luke,8,38,"So, this guy who got rid of the demons begged Jesus to let him stick around. But Jesus was like,"
Luke,8,39,Go back to your place and share the awesome stuff God did for you. So he left and started spreading the word all over town about the amazing things Jesus did for him.
Luke,8,40,"And it happened, that when Jesus came back, the peeps were stoked to see him, 'cause they were all hyped, waiting for him."
Luke,8,41,"So this guy named Jairus showed up, and he was like a super important leader at the synagogue. He straight up fell down at Jesus' feet and begged him to come chill at his crib:"
Luke,8,42,"So this guy had a daughter who was like twelve and she was super sick. But as he was going, a bunch of people crowded around him."
Luke,8,43,"There was this chick who had a major blood problem for, like, 12 long years. She literally spent all her money on doctors and none of them could fix her up, like, at all."
Luke,8,44,"Sneaked up from behind and tapped the edge of his clothes, and instantly her bleeding stopped."
Luke,8,45,"And Jesus was like, yo, who just touched me? But everyone was like, nah, not me. Then Peter and the squad were like, bro, there are so many people crowding and jostling you. Why you trippin' about who touched you?"
Luke,8,46,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, someone just touched me! I can totally feel that energy just flowing out of me.'"
Luke,8,47,"Yo, when this woman realized that she couldn't keep a low profile, she straight up started shaking. She dropped down in front of him and explained to everyone why she had touched him and how she got healed right away."
Luke,8,48,"And he was like, 'Yo, girl, chill out! Your faith is totally legit and it's healed you up. Go do your thing in peace."
Luke,8,49,"Just as he was talking, someone came from the house of the synagogue ruler and told him, 'Hey, your daughter is dead. Don't bother the Master.'"
Luke,8,50,"But when Jesus heard it, he was like, 'Chill out, dude. Just have faith, and she'll be totally healed.'"
Luke,8,51,"And when he entered the house, he didn't let anyone else in except Peter, James, John, and the girl's parents."
Luke,8,52,"Everyone was so sad and crying and grieving for her, but he was like, 'Chill out, don't cry! She's not dead, just taking a little nap.'"
Luke,8,53,"And they straight up clowned on him, fully aware that she was already deceased."
Luke,8,54,"And he kicked out everyone else, grabbed her hand, and shouted, 'Yo, girl, wake up!''"
Luke,8,55,"And then she like, came back to life, totally revived instantly. And he was like, 'Get her some food, like right now'."
Luke,8,56,"Her parents were totally shook, but he straight up told them not to spill the beans about what went down."
Luke,9,1,"And then he gathered his squad of twelve disciples, hooking them up with mad power and authority to flex on all the demons and heal all sorts of diseases."
Luke,9,2,So he told them to spread the word about God's kingdom and help those who were sick get better.
Luke,9,3,"And he was like, yo guys, before you go on this journey, don't even bother bringing anything - no sticks, no bags, no bread, no cash. And no need to bring extra outfits too, one is enough for each of you."
Luke,9,4,"Whenever you go into someone's place, chill there, and then bounce."
Luke,9,5,"And if anyone doesn't accept you when you leave that place, just brush off the dust from your sneakers as a way to show that they've missed out."
Luke,9,6,"So they bounced, going through the cities, spreading the good news, and hooking up with healing vibes everywhere."
Luke,9,7,"So like, Herod the tetrarch heard about everything going on with this dude, and he was totally freaking out because some people were saying that John came back to life and stuff."
Luke,9,8,"So, like, some people were saying that Elias had, like, totally shown up, and others were like, one of the OG prophets had, like, resurrected or something. No cap."
Luke,9,9,"So like, Herod was like, 'Yo, I straight up beheaded John, but who's this dude that's causing all this hype? I lowkey wanna check him out for myself.'"
Luke,9,10,"So, the apostles came back and spilled the tea to Jesus, filling him in on all the epic things they had accomplished. And then he grabbed them and sneaked away to a chill spot in the middle of nowhere, near this place called Bethsaida."
Luke,9,11,"And the peeps, when they found out about it, started tagging along: and he welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God, and fixed up those who needed healing."
Luke,9,12,"And when it started getting late, the twelve friends of Jesus came up to him and said, 'Yo, tell all these people to dip and go find some food and shelter in nearby towns and countryside, because we're stuck in the middle of nowhere.'"
Luke,9,13,"But he was like, 'Yo, just give 'em something to eat.' And they were all like, 'Bruh, we only got five loaves and two fishes. Unless we wanna go buy food for all these people.'"
Luke,9,14,"There were like about 5K dudes, you know? And he told his crew to line 'em up in groups of fifty, chillin' together."
Luke,9,15,"So they were like, 'Let's do this' and they made everyone find a spot and sit down."
Luke,9,16,"So like, Jesus was there with his homies, right? And he had these five loaves and two fishes. And then instead of being all stingy with the food, he looked up to the sky, gave thanks to God, and broke the bread and fish. And then he passed it on to his friends to give to all the people there."
Luke,9,17,"And they totally grubbed, and were totally stuffed: and they even had leftovers, so they gathered up twelve baskets worth, no cap."
Luke,9,18,"So, like, Jesus was praying by himself and his disciples were hanging with him. And then he asked them, like, 'Yo, who do people say I am?'"
Luke,9,19,"They replied, um like, some say it's John the Baptist; others are like, it could be Elias; and there are a few who think it's one of those OG prophets making a comeback."
Luke,9,20,"He asked them, like, who do you think I am? And Peter was like, you're the Christ, man, the chosen one from God."
Luke,9,21,And he straight up told them not to go around spillin' the tea about it to anyone;
Luke,9,22,"He was like, yo, I'm gonna go through mad struggles and the older peeps, like the elders and chief priests and scribes, gonna straight up reject me. But it's all good 'cause then I gonna be killed and come back to life on the third day."
Luke,9,23,"And he was like, yo everyone listen up, if anyone wants to roll with me, they gotta be down to put themselves second, carry their own struggles every day, and stay close to me."
Luke,9,24,"Like, if you're all about saving your own life, you'll end up losing it. But if you're willing to lose your life for my sake, you'll be the one actually saving it, you know?"
Luke,9,25,"Like, what's the point, bro, if a dude racks up the entire world but ends up losing himself or getting ditched?"
Luke,9,26,"If anyone is embarrassed to be associated with me and what I stand for, I'll be just as disappointed in them when I come back in all my amazing glory, along with my Dad and the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But listen up, fam, I'm spilling the tea: some of y'all right here won't even experience death before witnessing the kingdom of God."
Luke,9,28,"So, like, a week later or something, Jesus, like, took Peter, John, and James and went up this mountain to pray, you know? Just chillin' and stuff."
Luke,9,29,"While he was praying, his face totally transformed and his outfit started glowing white."
Luke,9,30,"So, like, check it out, two dudes were chatting with him, and it was Moses and Elias:"
Luke,9,31,"So, like, Jesus, right? He showed up in this totally awesome, divine glory and started talking about how he was gonna fulfill his purpose by, like, dying in Jerusalem."
Luke,9,32,"So Peter and his squad were mad tired and knocked out: but when they finally woke up, they were like 'Whoa!' cause they saw this totally epic glow-up moment and two homies chilling with him."
Luke,9,33,"As they were leaving, Peter was like, 'Yo, Jesus, this is lit! We should totally set up three tents—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' But to be real, he had no idea what he was saying."
Luke,9,34,"As he was talking, a big cloud appeared and covered them, and they were kinda scared when they went into the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"And a voice came from the cloud, like, 'Yo, this is my beloved Son, like listen to him, okay?'"
Luke,9,36,"And once the voice disappeared, Jesus was by himself. And they didn't tell anyone for a while about what they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"So, the next day, when they came down from the hill, a whole bunch of people met up with him."
Luke,9,38,"Yo, check this out! There was this dude from the crew who shouted, like, 'Hey Master, I'm begging you, please pay attention to my son. He's like my only kid, you know?'"
Luke,9,39,"Dude, listen up! This wild vibe hit this guy out of nowhere, and he starts freaking out big time. It's like he's being torn up inside and going all foamy, and this brutal condition just won't leave him alone."
Luke,9,40,"So I asked your squad to kick him out, but they totally couldn't."
Luke,9,41,"Yo, like, seriously? Can't believe how lacking in faith and messed up this generation is. How much longer am I gonna put up with you all? Bring your son over here."
Luke,9,42,"So like, as Jesus was approaching, the freaking devil pulled a nasty move and threw him down, totally messed him up. But then Jesus clapped back and told the unclean spirit to chill out, and not only that, he healed the child and handed him back to his dad."
Luke,9,43,"And everyone was totally blown away by how insanely awesome and powerful God was. But as they were freaking out over all the epic things that Jesus was doing, he turned to his crew and said,"
Luke,9,44,"Yo, like, really listen up to what I'm 'bout to say: the Son of man is gonna be handed over to some people, so take it in, ya know?"
Luke,9,45,"But like, they just didn't get what he was saying, you know? It was totally hidden from their understanding, so they couldn't even realize what he meant. And they were too afraid to even ask him about it."
Luke,9,46,"So, like, there was this whole argument among them, you know, about who should be the most popular or the top dog."
Luke,9,47,"And Jesus, sensing what they were thinking, grabbed a kid and plopped them right next to him,"
Luke,9,48,"And like, Jesus was all like, yo guys, whoever's down to embrace this kiddo in my name is also embracing me. And whoever's down to embrace me is also embracing the one who sent me, you know? 'Cause, like, the person who's chillin' at the bottom and is considered the least among y'all, will eventually rise up and become hella great."
Luke,9,49,"Yo, Jesus, check it out. So me and the crew, we noticed this dude straight up exorcising demons using your name, right? And we were like, 'Hold up, this guy ain't rollin' with us.'"
Luke,9,50,"And Jesus was like, don't stop them, man! If they're not against us, then they're totally on our team."
Luke,9,51,"So, when the time rolled around for him to head up to Jerusalem, he was totally determined and focused on making that journey."
Luke,9,52,"Then he DM'd some messengers ahead of him and they went and slid into a village of the Samaritans, to prep the place for him."
Luke,9,53,"And they, like, didn't accept him because they thought he was gonna head to Jerusalem or something."
Luke,9,54,"And when his squad James and John peeped that, they were like, yo, Jesus, you want us to summon some heavenly fire and wipe them out, just like how Elijah did?"
Luke,9,55,"But he like totally clapped back at them and was like, 'Dude, you all have no clue about the vibes you're putting out.'"
Luke,9,56,"The Son of man didn't come to wreck everyone's lives, but to save 'em. And then they bounced to another village."
Luke,9,57,"As they were chillin' on the road, this random guy was like, 'Yo, Lord, I'm down to roll with you wherever you go.'"
Luke,9,58,"And Jesus was like, yo bro, foxes gotta crib and birds got their nests, but your boy, the Son of man, ain't got no place to crash."
Luke,9,59,"Then he told someone else, 'Come with me.' But the person replied, 'Hold up, let me first go and take care of my dad's funeral.'"
Luke,9,60,"Jesus was like, let the dead people handle their own burial stuff. You, though, go and spread the word about God's kingdom."
Luke,9,61,"Then someone else said, Yo, Lord, I'm down to follow you, but lemme first go say peace to my homies back at the crib."
Luke,9,62,"And Jesus was like, 'Listen up, no one who starts something and keeps looking back is gonna make it into God's kingdom.'"
Luke,10,1,"After that, the Lord picked out seventy more people and sent them out in pairs ahead of him to all the cities and places he planned to visit."
Luke,10,2,"So he's like, yo, listen up fam, the harvest game is strong, but we're low on workers, for real. So let's all send our prayers to the Lord of the harvest, asking him to hook us up with some extra hands for the hustle."
Luke,10,3,"Yo, listen up: check it, I'm sending you out like innocent little lambs in a pack of hungry wolves."
Luke,10,4,"Don't bring your wallet, bag, or kicks, and don't stop to chat with anyone along the way."
Luke,10,5,"When you go into someone's crib, start with some chill vibes like, Peacee up, this house!'"
Luke,10,6,"And if you come across someone who brings positive vibes, your good vibes will chill with them. But if not, your good vibes are gonna bounce back to you."
Luke,10,7,"Just hang out in the same crib, eating and drinking whatever they serve you. A worker deserves to be paid, so don't be bouncing from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"When you go into a city and they welcome you with open arms, just go with the flow and eat whatever they offer you without complaining:"
Luke,10,9,"Go and help out the sick people there, and tell them that the kingdom of God is near them."
Luke,10,10,"So, like, when you go to a new city and people don't welcome you, just bounce and hit the streets. Here's what you gotta say..."
Luke,10,11,"Like, seriously, even the dusty vibes of your city that stick to us, we're totally brushing off in your direction, but just so you know, the kingdom of God is, like, totally on the doorstep for you and stuff."
Luke,10,12,"But listen up, I gotta tell you, when that day comes, Sodom will have an easier time than that city."
Luke,10,13,"Oh no, Chorazin! Oh no, Bethsaida! If the awesome miracles that happened in Tyre and Sidon had happened in your towns, those people would have straight up repented a long time ago, being all humble and remorseful."
Luke,10,14,"Like, it's gonna be way easier for Tyre and Sidon when it comes to judging, compared to you guys."
Luke,10,15,"And yo, Capernaum, you were all high and mighty, thinking you're on top of the world, but guess what? You're about to hit rock bottom real quick."
Luke,10,16,"If someone listens to you, they're listening to me; but if they disrespect you, they're disrespecting me; and if they disrespect me, they're disrespecting the one who sent me."
Luke,10,17,"And the seventy came back stoked, saying, Yo Lord, even the demons be bowing down to us when we throw your name in the mix."
Luke,10,18,"And he was like, yo guys, I totally saw Satan like, bam, drop from heaven like a lightning bolt."
Luke,10,19,"Yo, check it out, I'm hooking you up with mad power to step on snakes and scorpions, and conquer all your enemies. Nothin' can touch you, seriously."
Luke,10,20,"But yo, don't get all hyped just cuz you got powers and stuff. The real flex is that your names are straight up written in heaven. That's the real reason to celebrate, fam."
Luke,10,21,"At that moment, Jesus was stoked AF and shouted, 'Yo, big shoutout to you, Dad, the ultimate boss of the sky and earth, for keeping this knowledge under wraps from the know-it-alls and sharing it with us young ones. It's all good, Father, because it's totally your vibe.'"
Luke,10,22,"My Father has given me everything, and no one really knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son, and those who the Son chooses to reveal Him to. (Some old texts include these words at the start of the verse: And looking at his disciples, he said)"
Luke,10,23,"Then he looked at his crew and said quietly, Yo, y'all are lucky! Your eyes witnessing some mind-blowing stuff."
Luke,10,24,"Bruh, lemme tell ya, so many prophets and kings, they seriously wished they could see the things that you're seeing right now. Like, they never got a chance, ya know? And they would've killed to hear the stuff that's reachin' your ears, but nah, they missed out on all of it."
Luke,10,25,"So, this lawyer dude came forward and tried to test him, saying, 'Hey, Teacher, what do I gotta do to score that eternal life?'"
Luke,10,26,"He was like, yo, what's written in the law, bruh? How do you interpret it?"
Luke,10,27,"And he was like, yo! Someone asked him, and he was like, you gotta love God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, dude! And don't forget to love your neighbor as much as yourself, bro!"
Luke,10,28,"And he was like, 'Yeah, you got it! Do this and you'll be livin' the good life.'"
Luke,10,29,"But he was like, trying to make himself look good, said to Jesus, like, 'So, who exactly is my neighbor?'"
Luke,10,30,"So Jesus was like, there was this dude who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho. And suddenly, he got jumped by a bunch of thieves who not only took all his fancy clothes, but also beat him up really bad and left him almost dead."
Luke,10,31,"So this priest was walking by, and when he saw the guy, he just ignored him and walked to the other side, like, no big deal."
Luke,10,32,"And then this Levite dude, right? He spots the guy lying there, checks him out, and just totally proceeds to bounce to the opposite side without lifting a finger to help."
Luke,10,33,"So, like, there's this Samaritan dude who was traveling and he, like, totally stumbled upon this other guy. And guess what? As soon as he saw him, he was filled with all this compassion and stuff!"
Luke,10,34,"So {they} went up to {him}, patched up his wounds, using some soothing oil and wine, put him on {his} own ride, and took {him} to a nearby spot, making sure {he} was well taken care of."
Luke,10,35,"The next day, when he left, he pulled out some cash and gave it to the person in charge, saying, 'Make sure to take care of him. And whatever else you spend, I'll pay you back when I come back."
Luke,10,36,"So, like, out of these three guys, who do you think was, like, the real homie to the dude who got messed up by those thieves?"
Luke,10,37,"And he was like, 'Yo, the one who showed mercy to him.' Then Jesus was like, 'Alright bro, go and do the same thing.'"
Luke,10,38,"So, this thing happened while they were on their way, this guy went into a village and this girl named Martha welcomed him into her house."
Luke,10,39,"And there was this girl named Mary, who was also chilling at Jesus' feet, soaking up everything he said."
Luke,10,40,"Martha was totally overwhelmed trying to do everything herself, so she went up to Jesus and was like, 'Dude, seriously? Don't you even care that my sister ditched me to do all the work? Tell her to give me a hand, like ASAP.'"
Luke,10,41,"And Jesus was like, yo Martha, chillax! You're all stressed and caught up in a million things:"
Luke,10,42,"But listen up, fam: there's only one thing that truly matters, and Mary made the smart move by choosing the awesome part that can't be snatched away from her."
Luke,11,1,"So, like, Jesus was doing his prayer thing in this specific spot, right? And after he finished, one of his followers was like, 'Yo, Lord, teach us how to pray, just like John showed his crew.'"
Luke,11,2,"Yo, listen up. So, when you pray, like, you gotta say this: 'Yo bro, our Father, who's chillin' up in the skies, we mad respect your name. Let your kingdom come, and your will be done, just like up in heaven, as it goes down here on earth.'"
Luke,11,3,"Hook us up with our daily bread, you feel me? Like, we need that sustenance on the regular. {day by day: or, for the day}"
Luke,11,4,"And, like, forgive us for our mistakes and stuff, 'cause we also forgive, like, anyone who owes us. And, like, don't let us get all caught up in temptation and junk, but help us, like, avoid evil, you know?"
Luke,11,5,"Yo, he was like, 'Check it fam, imagine you got a homie, right? And you slide up to his place in the middle of the night, like, 'Bruh, lemme borrow three loaves real quick!'"
Luke,11,6,"Yo, my homie just stopped by, and I ain't got no food to offer him. He's been on a long trip and I don't wanna leave him empty-handed. What should I do?"
Luke,11,7,"And the person inside will respond and say, Don't bother me: the door is closed, and my squad is chillin' with me in bed; I can't get up and hook you up."
Luke,11,8,"Listen up, I'm telling you, even if the dude won't get up and give his friend what he needs just because they're tight, he'll still get up and give it to him because his friend keeps bugging him for it. He'll hook him up with as much as he wants, no doubt!"
Luke,11,9,"Yo, listen up! If you want something, just ask for it. If you're searching for something, keep looking and you'll find it. Knock on the door, and it will totally be opened for you."
Luke,11,10,"Like, if you ask, you'll totally receive; and if you're out there seeking, you'll find; and if you knock, the door will be opened, no doubt."
Luke,11,11,"Yo, if your homie asks you for a piece of bread, you ain't gonna be like, 'Nah fam, here's a rock.' Or if they're like, 'Yo, can I get a fish?' You won't be all like, 'Gotchu, here's a snake.'"
Luke,11,12,"Like, if someone asks for an egg, you think they're gonna get offered a scorpion? I mean, come on now! 🥚💁‍♂️"
Luke,11,13,"So, like, if you, being not so perfect, know how to hook your kids up with awesome presents, just imagine how much our heavenly Father will bless us with the Holy Spirit when we ask Him?"
Luke,11,14,"So this dude was like, totally kicking out a demon, and get this, the demon made the person all quiet. But then, once the demon left, the person could speak again, and everyone was seriously mind-blown."
Luke,11,15,"But like, there were some people who were all like, 'Yo, this dude be casting out demons with the help of Beelzebub, the big boss of all demons. {Beelzebub: Gr. Beelzebul}'"
Luke,11,16,"And some others, trying to test Him, asked Him to perform a cool miracle from the sky."
Luke,11,17,"But yo, he peeped their thoughts and was like, listen up fam, every kingdom that's at odds with itself ends up in ruins, and a house divided against itself straight up crumbles."
Luke,11,18,"If Satan's squad is fighting each other, how do you expect his empire to last? You're saying I kick out demons by being buddies with Beelzebub."
Luke,11,19,"And if I use a TikTok filter to banish evil spirits, who do your own friends use to do the same? So they should be the ones to judge you."
Luke,11,20,"Yo, if I'm out here casting out devils with God's power, no doubt the kingdom of God is straight up here for you, fam."
Luke,11,21,"When a totally buff dude has a tight security on his crib, all his stuff stays chill and unbothered:"
Luke,11,22,"But when a total beast comes in and totally owns him, like, he takes away all his fancy armor that he thought was cool, and totally shows off his loot."
Luke,11,23,"If you're not on my team, you're against me. And if you're not helping me, you're just making a mess."
Luke,11,24,"Once the evil spirit bounces out of a person, it wanders around in deserted spots, desperately looking for peace. But since it can't find any, it's like, 'I'm going back to where I came from, my dudes.'"
Luke,11,25,"And when he arrives, he sees that {it} all cleaned up and looking fresh."
Luke,11,26,"So, like, this guy goes and gets seven even more evil spirits than himself and they totally move in and take over. And then it's like, the guy's situation becomes way worse than before, you know?"
Luke,11,27,"As he was saying these things, a woman from the group spoke up and said, 'Lucky is the mom who gave birth to you and the boobs you sucked.'"
Luke,11,28,"But like, for real, blessed are those who actually listen to God's Word and legit live it out."
Luke,11,29,"And when all the people were like, packed together, he started saying, 'Yo, this generation is messed up. All they want is some crazy sign, but they ain't getting any except the one Jonah the prophet did.'"
Luke,11,30,"Just like how Jonas was a major flex for those Ninevites, the Son of man is gonna be a lit vibe for our generation, ya feel?"
Luke,11,31,"The queen from the south will emerge in the final judgment alongside the guys of this era and put them to shame. She traveled all the way from the corners of the world to soak up Solomon's wisdom, and guess what? There's someone even more amazing than Solomon right here."
Luke,11,32,"The guys from Nineveh are gonna come back in the future and be like, 'This generation totally messed up!' 'Cause they changed their ways when Jonah spoke up, but hey, someone even more awesome than Jonah is right here, right now."
Luke,11,33,"Yo, when someone lights a candle, they don't hide it or stash it away. They put that thing on a candle holder so that anyone who comes in can see the light, you know?"
Luke,11,34,"Your eyes are like the lightbulbs of your whole body. If your eyes are focused and clear, then your whole body will be filled with positivity and brightness. But if your eyes are clouded with negativity and darkness, then your whole body will be consumed by it."
Luke,11,35,"So, like, make sure that the good vibes within you don't turn into negative vibes, ya know?"
Luke,11,36,"If your whole vibe is lit and there's no darkness in any part, then your whole vibe will be fully lit, just like when a dope candle shines bright and gives you good vibes. (Note: 'dope' means cool or awesome in Gen Z slang)"
Luke,11,37,"So, like, as he was talking, this Pharisee dude asked him to come and have dinner with him. And, of course, he accepted the invitation, went inside, and sat down to enjoy the meal."
Luke,11,38,"And when the Pharisee saw {it}, he was like, 'Whoa, this dude didn't even wash before grubbing.'"
Luke,11,39,"And God was like, yo Pharisees, you be all about that aesthetic, makin' the outside of your cup and plate look all shiny and clean. But deep down, your inner selves are straight up messed up, filled with greed and wickedness."
Luke,11,40,"Yo, fools, didn't the one who created the outer stuff also create the inner stuff?"
Luke,11,41,"Instead, share what you have with those in need; and look, then everything will be good for you. {or, according to what you're able}"
Luke,11,42,"But listen up, Pharisees! You're all about that mint, rue, and all those fancy herbs, but you completely ignore what really matters: doing what's right and showing love for God. Sure, you shouldn't neglect the herbs, but don't forget about the important stuff too!"
Luke,11,43,"So, Pharisees, you're in for a major bummer! You're all about grabbing the best seats at the synagogues and soaking up those fancy hellos in the markets."
Luke,11,44,"Dang, you scribes and Pharisees, such fakes! You're like invisible graves, totally blending in, and people walking by have no clue!"
Luke,11,45,"Then this lawyer dude spoke up and was like, 'Yo, Master, you're totally calling us out with what you just said, too.'"
Luke,11,46,"And he was like, dang, you lawyers are in big trouble! You're like loading people up with heavy burdens that really suck, but you don't even lift a finger to help them out."
Luke,11,47,"That's seriously messed up, fam! You out here constructing fancy tombs for the prophets, but your ancestors are the ones who killed them. Like, what's even up with that?"
Luke,11,48,"Seriously, you guys admit that you're cool with doing what your ancestors did. They straight up killed those prophets and here you are, building fancy tombs for them."
Luke,11,49,"So, like, God's wisdom was all like, 'Yo, I'm gonna send them prophets and apostles, and some of them haters gonna straight up kill and harass them, no cap 🙌🔥"
Luke,11,50,"So, like, all the blood of the prophets that got spilled since forever ago, it's, like, gonna be, um, the responsibility of this current generation, you know?"
Luke,11,51,"Yo, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, who got wiped out between the altar and the temple, I'm telling ya, this generation's gonna be held accountable for it."
Luke,11,52,"Bruh, listen up, lawyers! Y'all straight up blocked the path to enlightenment. Not only did you not go in yourselves, but you also stopped others from entering. Like, c'mon, what's up with that?!"
Luke,11,53,"And when he said this, the scribes and Pharisees totally started pressuring him, trying to get him to talk about all sorts of stuff:"
Luke,11,54,They were totally plotting and trying to find something he said just so they could bring charges against him.
Luke,12,1,"So, like, there were, like, so many people gathered, like, a huge crowd, they were literally stepping over each other. And then Jesus was all like, yo, listen up, disciples! This is important, okay? Watch out for those Pharisees and their fake vibes, you know? They're all about that hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"Cause nothing stays hidden forever, everything will be revealed and known eventually."
Luke,12,3,"So basically, whatever you say secretly will eventually come out in the open, and whatever you whisper in private will be made public for everyone to know."
Luke,12,4,"Yo, listen up squad, don't trip about those haters who just tryna mess with your physical self, 'cause once they're done, they got no power left to do anything else."
Luke,12,5,"But let me give you a heads up on who you should be afraid of: Be afraid of the one who can not only kill, but also has the power to throw you into hell. Yeah, I'm telling you, that's the one you should be afraid of."
Luke,12,6,"Um, like, have you ever noticed how like, you can buy five sparrows for, like, basically next to nothing? And here's the thing, not one of them goes unnoticed by God, you know? Just goes to show, He's got His eyes on even the tiniest creatures and cares about every little thing happening in the world, no cap."
Luke,12,7,"Yo, like, even every single strand of your hair has been counted. So, don't stress, fam: you're worth way more than a whole gang of sparrows."
Luke,12,8,"Oh, and listen up, y'all. Whoever speaks up for me in front of others, well, the Son of Man will speak up for them in front of all the heavenly homies!"
Luke,12,9,But anyone who disses me in front of others will get dissed by the angels of God.
Luke,12,10,"If someone says something negative about the Son of Man, they can be forgiven. But if someone disrespects the Holy Ghost, that's something that can't be forgiven."
Luke,12,11,"And when they take you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and authorities, don't stress about how or what you're gonna say or answer:"
Luke,12,12,"Yo, the Holy Ghost got you covered. When you're in the moment, He's gonna drop the knowledge and tell you exactly what to say, no sweat."
Luke,12,13,"Yo, one of the squad went up to him like, 'Yo, teach, tell my bro to split the inheritance with me.'"
Luke,12,14,"And he was like, bruh, who made me the one to judge or decide for y'all?"
Luke,12,15,"Yo, listen up! I gotta drop some wisdom on ya. Don't fall into the trap of being all about that covetousness, alright? 'Cause let me tell you, life ain't all about how much stuff you got. It's about way more than material possessions, you feel me?"
Luke,12,16,"So, like, Jesus told them this story, you know? He was like, 'Yo, there was this super wealthy dude, and his land was all productive and stuff, bringing in a ton of crops and whatnot."
Luke,12,17,"And he was like, yo, what am I gonna do, 'cause I got all these fruits and nowhere to stash 'em?"
Luke,12,18,"And he was like, yo, I got this idea. I'm gonna tear down my old storage barns and build even bigger ones, so I can stash all my fruits and stuff over there."
Luke,12,19,"And I'll be like, yo soul, you got so much stuff stacked up for years, just chill out, eat, drink, and have a blast."
Luke,12,20,"But God was like, 'Listen up, you fool! Tonight, your soul will be taken away from you. So, who do you think will inherit all the stuff you've been hoarding?'"
Luke,12,21,"Like, if someone is all about hoarding tons of stuff for themselves, and doesn't give a second thought about having a meaningful relationship with God, then, like, they're totally missing the point, you know?"
Luke,12,22,"And he's like telling his squad, so I'm telling you, don't stress about your life, like don't overthink about what you're gonna eat or what clothes you're gonna wear."
Luke,12,23,Life is way beyond food and our bodies are more than just clothes.
Luke,12,24,"Yo, peep the ravens, they out here not planting no seeds or harvesting, don't even have a stash or a crib to store stuff. But check it, God still hooks them up with food. So, like, if He takes care of some birds, imagine how much more He's got your back, my squad. You're way more important than them feathered fam."
Luke,12,25,"Seriously, why stress about adding an extra inch to your height? Like, it's not something you can just magically control, you know?"
Luke,12,26,"If you can't even handle the small stuff, why stress about the rest?"
Luke,12,27,"Just take a sec to check out those lilies—they don't stress or work hard to look good, and yet, let me tell you, not even King Solomon, with all his lavishness, could match their fab-ness."
Luke,12,28,"Like, if God can totally deck out the grass in the field today and then roast it in the oven tomorrow, imagine how much more He'll hook you up, you doubters!"
Luke,12,29,"And like, don't stress about what you're gonna eat or drink, and don't be all uncertain and stuff, you know? Chill, don't overthink it."
Luke,12,30,"So like, everyone in the whole world is always chasing after these things, you know? But, yo, here's the deal: your Dad totally gets that you need these things too."
Luke,12,31,"Instead, go after God's kingdom and everything else will fall into place."
Luke,12,32,"Don't stress, fam; it's your dad's lit plan to hook you up with the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"Yo, like, sell all your stuff and give money to those in need. Invest in like, timeless fashion, man, that's a heavenly treasure that never runs out, protected from thieves and moth damage."
Luke,12,34,"Like, whatever you really value and put all your focus on, that's where your heart will be too."
Luke,12,35,Make sure your outfit is on point and keep your phone flashlight ready at all times;
Luke,12,36,"And you all, be like people who are waiting for their boss, when they come back from a lit party; so that when they arrive and start banging on the door, you can open it right away."
Luke,12,37,"Those loyal homies are straight up blessed, yo! When the lord rolls up, if he finds them all alert and attentive, let me tell you, he's gonna get hyped! He gonna put on his best swag and invite them to feast with him. And get this, he gonna serve them himself, like a boss!"
Luke,12,38,"And if he shows up in the middle of the night or even later and sees them doing their thing, those servants are totally blessed."
Luke,12,39,"Just so you know, if the person running the crib knew when the thief was gonna roll up, they would've kept an eye out and made sure their place wasn't jacked."
Luke,12,40,"So, like, just be prepared, okay? 'Cause the Son of man will show up when you least expect it, man."
Luke,12,41,"Yo, Peter asked Him, 'Yo Lord, are you telling this story just for us or for everyone?'"
Luke,12,42,"Yo, the Lord was like, who's gonna be the real one in charge, you know? The one who's loyal and smart, and can handle running the whole crib? They gotta be on point, serving up that grub at the right time."
Luke,12,43,How awesome is that servant who is found by his boss doing his work when he arrives.
Luke,12,44,"I'm telling you straight up, he's gonna make him the ultimate boss over everything he's got."
Luke,12,45,"But what if that servant starts thinking, like, 'Yo, my boss is taking forever to show up.' And then he starts bossing around other staff and being all violent and stuff, partying hard, drinking 'til he's wasted."
Luke,12,46,"The boss of that servant will pop up unexpectedly one day, catching him completely off-guard, and give him a major reality check. He'll be left hanging with the non-believers. (Or in other words, he'll be totally cut off!)"
Luke,12,47,"And that servant, who knew exactly what their boss wanted them to do, but didn't bother to get ready or actually do it, will face a whole lot of consequences."
Luke,12,48,"But if someone didn't know any better and did things that deserved punishment, they'll get a few whacks. Because the more you've been given, the more will be expected from you. And if people have entrusted you with a lot, they'll demand even more from you."
Luke,12,49,"Yo, I've come to bring the heat on this world. Like, imagine if it's already lit, what more can I possibly do?"
Luke,12,50,"TBH, I've got this baptism to go through and I'm like so eager for it to happen! It's low-key giving me some major feels and I can't wait for it to be done! #cantwait"
Luke,12,51,"Do y'all think I came to bring the chill vibes and peace on this planet? Nah, I gotta be real with ya, it's quite the opposite - I'm here to shake things up and cause some serious division."
Luke,12,52,"Yo, listen up! From now on, things are gonna get real chaotic at home. It's gonna be like a real-life game of tug of war, with five people in one crib splitting up into teams. You got three homies on Team A and two on Team B, but it's gonna be a serious showdown because Team B is ganging up on Team A with three members. It's gonna be intense, bro!"
Luke,12,53,"Fam, it's gonna be real tough out here - even fam against fam. Dad against son, son against dad, mom against daughter, daughter against mom. Even the in-laws gonna be caught up in this mess, with the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law."
Luke,12,54,"And he was like, yo to the people, when you see a cloud coming from the west, you immediately go like, 'Yo, it's about to rain!' and that's exactly what happens, yo."
Luke,12,55,"And when you peeps spot that south wind blowing, you're like, 'Yo, it's about to get hot up in here!' And sure enough, it totally happens."
Luke,12,56,"Yo, fake peeps, you can peep the weather and stuff, but how come you can't peep what's going on right now?"
Luke,12,57,"Seriously, dudes, like, why don't you even try to figure out what's right on your own?"
Luke,12,58,"When you're dealing with someone you have a problem with, and you both end up facing an authority figure, make sure to put in the effort to resolve things before it gets worse. Otherwise, you might end up being taken to court, and from there, handed over to the police, who will throw you in jail."
Luke,12,59,"Listen up, bro, you ain't getting outta there until you've paid every single penny, believe me."
Luke,13,1,"So, like, during that time, some people came up to him and told him about these Galileans. Apparently, Pilate had, like, mixed their blood with their sacrifices or something. Crazy, right?"
Luke,13,2,"Yo, Jesus be like, listen up, y'all think these Galileans were like the biggest sinners in the whole Galilee just 'cause they went through some tough stuff?"
Luke,13,3,"Listen up: No way, but if you don't change your ways, all of you are gonna bite the dust. 🙌"
Luke,13,4,"Yo, what do y'all think about those eighteen people who got crushed by the tower in Siloam? Do you really believe they were more sinful than everyone else living in Jerusalem?"
Luke,13,5,"Listen up, no cap: If y'all don't repent, you gonna meet the same fate, straight up."
Luke,13,6,"So, like, there was this dude who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, ya know? And he went to check it out and was looking for some fruit on it, but, like, he couldn't find any, man."
Luke,13,7,"Then he said to the person in charge of his vineyard, like yo, check this out, for the past three years I've been looking for some juicy fruit on this fig tree and let me tell you, nada, zilch, zero! So let's chop it down, man, why is it blocking the ground and taking up space?"
Luke,13,8,"And he was like, yo, let it chill for one more year, until I can dig around it and give it some fertilizer, ya know?"
Luke,13,9,"And if it starts flexing, like, good for it: but if it doesn't, then you gotta straight up chop it down."
Luke,13,10,"So, like, he's, you know, teaching in this chill synagogue on the sabbath day."
Luke,13,11,"Yo, check it out, there was this woman who had been dealing with a serious health issue for 18 years. She was all hunched over and couldn't straighten up at all."
Luke,13,12,"And when Jesus peeped her, he hit her up and said, 'Girl, you free from your struggles now'."
Luke,13,13,"And he touched her, like, legit put his hands on her, and suddenly she was all good and started flexin', giving props to God."
Luke,13,14,"The person in charge of the synagogue got all worked up because Jesus healed on the sabbath day. They said to everyone, 'There's six other days to get stuff done, so why don't you come and get healed on those days instead of the sabbath day?'"
Luke,13,15,"And then the Lord was like, 'Dude, seriously? Don't you all untie your animals and take them to drink on the Sabbath? Hypocritical much?'"
Luke,13,16,"Yo, shouldn't this chick, being a straight-up descendant of Abraham, who's been all tied up by Satan for, like, eighteen whole years, be set free from this mess on the freakin' sabbath day?"
Luke,13,17,"And like, after he said all that stuff, all his haters were totally embarrassed, but all the people were like, super stoked about all the epic things he did."
Luke,13,18,"Yo, he was like, 'What can I compare the kingdom of God to? How should I describe it, fam?'"
Luke,13,19,"Imagine a tiny mustard seed that a dude planted in his garden. In no time, it sprouted and grew into this massive tree, big enough for birds to chill and make nests in its branches, yo!"
Luke,13,20,"And once more he's like, yo, what can I compare the kingdom of God to, fam?"
Luke,13,21,"It's kinda like when this chick grabbed some leaven and sneakily mixed it into three loads of dough, so the whole thing got all leavened up."
Luke,13,22,"So, like, Jesus was going through all these cities and villages, you know? He was just spreading his wisdom and stuff, and he was on his way to Jerusalem, like, to continue his mission."
Luke,13,23,"So this person asked Him, like, 'Yo, Jesus, are only a small number of people gonna get saved?' And Jesus was like,"
Luke,13,24,"Try your absolute best to enter through the narrow gate, because let me tell you, there are gonna be a lot of people tryna enter but won't be able to make it."
Luke,13,25,"When the big boss of the crib wakes up and locks the door, and you're left standing outside, banging on the door like, 'Yo, dude, let us in!' and he's gonna be like, 'Nah, I don't know where you guys came from, sorry.'"
Luke,13,26,"And like, we'll be all like, 'Yo, we totally ate and drank with you, and you were teaching on our streets and stuff.'"
Luke,13,27,"But, like, he's gonna be all like, 'Yo, I don't know where you came from, so, like, peace out, all you evildoers.'"
Luke,13,28,"There's gonna be a lot of crying and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets chilling in the Kingdom of God, and you get left out."
Luke,13,29,"And people will come from all over - east, west, north, south - and they'll kick it in the kingdom of God."
Luke,13,30,"Yo, listen up: Some of the people you think are at the back of the line gonna end up being at the front, while some of the so-called 'first' ones gonna find themselves at the back. Life's full of surprises, my peeps."
Luke,13,31,"On that day, a bunch of Pharisees showed up, and they were like, 'Yo, you need to bounce from here ASAP, 'cause Herod's out to get you and he's thirsty for some blood.'"
Luke,13,32,"He said to them, 'Yo, go spread the word: Check it, I'm kicking out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I'll be on top of my game.'"
Luke,13,33,"But hey, I gotta keep on movin' today, tomorrow, and the next day, 'cause you know, a prophet like me can't just kick the bucket anywhere but in Jerusalem."
Luke,13,34,"Yo, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you be killin' the prophets and stoning the ones sent to you. I've been tryna bring your kids together, like a hen protectin' her chicks under her wings, but y'all straight up refuse to gather!"
Luke,13,35,"Yo, listen up! Your crib is gonna be straight-up deserted, no lie. And for real, I'm telling you, you won't catch a glimpse of me until the day you be like, 'Holla, blessed be the homie rollin' in the name of the Lord.'"
Luke,14,1,"So, this dude was chillin' and decided to go to the house of a top Pharisee to grab some grub on the Sabbath day. But little did he know, they were totally keeping an eye on him."
Luke,14,2,"Yo, check it out, there was this dude standing in front of him who had the dropsy."
Luke,14,3,"So Jesus responded and talked to the lawyers and Pharisees, and asked them, like, is it cool to like, heal on the sabbath day or what?"
Luke,14,4,"And they stayed quiet. Then he took {him}, fixed him up, and let him go;"
Luke,14,5,"And like, they were asking him, you know, which one of y'all wouldn't save your pet donkey or cow if it accidentally fell in a hole on, like, a holy day?"
Luke,14,6,"And, like, they totally couldn't even come up with a comeback to what he just said."
Luke,14,7,"So, Jesus told a story to those who were invited, because he noticed how they all tried to grab the best seats. And he said to them,"
Luke,14,8,"When someone invites you to a wedding, don't just plop yourself in the most VIP spot. You might end up getting outshone by someone even more important than you."
Luke,14,9,"And the person who invited both you and the other person tells you to make way for this man, and you feel embarrassed as you reluctantly take the least important seat."
Luke,14,10,"But, like, when you get invited somewhere, don't go and sit at, like, the most important spot. Instead, find a seat at the least important spot. That way, when the person who invited you sees you, they can be like, 'Dude, come sit at a higher spot!' And then you'll get mad respect in front of everyone else at the table."
Luke,14,11,"If anyone tries to flex and act all superior, they'll end up embarrassed, but if they're down-to-earth and humble, they'll be admired and lifted up."
Luke,14,12,"And he also said to the person who invited him, like, when you have a dinner or a really lit supper, don't just invite your squad, your fam, or your rich homies because they'll just invite you back and it'll be like a never-ending cycle of favors."
Luke,14,13,"But when you throw a lit party, invite the fam who might be strugglin' - the ones who don't have much, those with disabilities, and the people who can't see so well:"
Luke,14,14,"You'll be hella blessed, 'cause they can't repay you, but you'll be repaid big time at the resurrection of the good peeps."
Luke,14,15,"And when one of the squad chillin' at the table heard what Jesus said, he was like, 'Yo, shoutout to the lucky ones who get to munch on some heavenly bread in God's kingdom, man.'"
Luke,14,16,"So basically, this dude was like, 'Yo, listen up. There was this guy who threw the sickest party ever and invited mad peeps.'"
Luke,14,17,"Then he texted his homie right before dinner and was like, 'Yo, the feast is lit - come through ASAP, everything's on point.'"
Luke,14,18,"And they all, like, totally agreed and started making excuses. The first guy was like, 'Sorry, dude, I just purchased this sick chunk of land and I gotta go check it out ASAP. Can you please cut me some slack?'"
Luke,14,19,"Yo, listen up! This other person said, 'Yo, I just copped five yoke of oxen and I gotta go test 'em out. Can you please cut me some slack?'"
Luke,14,20,"Yo, this other person was like, 'No can do, man. I just got hitched, so I can't make it.'"
Luke,14,21,"So this dude comes and tells his boss what went down. And the boss, being mad af, tells the dude to bounce and bring in all the poor, disabled, and disadvantaged peeps from the city streets and alleys."
Luke,14,22,"And the servant was like, 'Yo, Lord, I did what you said and there's still space left.'"
Luke,14,23,"Yo, the boss man told the servant, head out to the roads and alleys, and persuade people to come in, so my crib can be lit."
Luke,14,24,"Hey, listen up y'all! I gotta tell ya, not a single one of those dudes I invited is gonna get a bite of my epic feast."
Luke,14,25,"And lots of people were following him: so he looked at them and said,"
Luke,14,26,"If anyone comes to me and isn't willing to prioritize me over their own family and even their own life, then they can't be my true follower."
Luke,14,27,"And if you're not willing to shoulder your struggles and follow my lead, you can't roll with me as a true disciple."
Luke,14,28,"Like, which one of you, when you're gonna build, like, a super dope tower, don't even think twice and calculate if you have enough funds to complete the whole thing?"
Luke,14,29,"So like, imagine this guy starts building something, but then he runs out of energy and can't even finish it. And then everyone who sees it starts making fun of him. Shook, right?"
Luke,14,30,"He was like, 'Yo, this dude started building but couldn't even finish.'"
Luke,14,31,"Imagine this, right? You've got a king who's about to go all out in battle against another king. But yo, before throwing down, he's gotta sit down for a sec and be like, 'Yo, can I actually take on this dude who's rolling up with twice the troops I got?'"
Luke,14,32,"Or like, before the other person even gets close, he sends a message, trying to work things out and make peace."
Luke,14,33,"Just so you know, if anyone here isn't ready to give up everything they have, they can't be on my squad."
Luke,14,34,"Salt is legit awesome: but if the salt loses its flavor, how can it even be seasoned anymore?"
Luke,14,35,"Well, you know, this thing ain't good for the ground or even for the junkyard; people just toss it away. If you're really paying attention, then listen up, my dudes."
Luke,15,1,Then all the tax collectors and 'party animals' gathered around to listen to him.
Luke,15,2,"So, like, the Pharisees and scribes were all like, whispering and stuff, and saying, You won't believe it, but this dude actually hangs out with sinners and even grabs a bite with them."
Luke,15,3,"So, he started explaining this story to them, like,"
Luke,15,4,"Imagine this, fam: You're a shepherd chilling with a hundred sheep, right? But then, one of them goes missing. Would you just leave the other ninety-nine alone in the wilderness and not search high and low until you find that lost sheep? Nah, man! You gotta go find your lost homie!"
Luke,15,5,"And when he finally finds it, he throws it over his shoulders and starts celebrating like crazy."
Luke,15,6,"And when he gets back home, he gathers all his squad and fam, shouting out to them like, 'Let's get lit, y'all! I found my lost sheep!'"
Luke,15,7,"Yo, listen up! In heaven, there's gonna be mad joy when just one sinner comes to the realness and repents. It's gonna be even more lit than celebrating the ninety-nine righteous people who be living right and don't need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"Imagine this girl who has like, ten shiny coins. But oh no, she loses one! So what does she do? She grabs a candle, cleans the entire house, and goes on a serious scavenger hunt until she finds that precious coin. She's determined to find it! You know, just like a drachma is a small part of an ounce, this coin is like worth some serious dough, like Roman penny level. It's valuable and worth searching for!"
Luke,15,9,"And when she finally finds it, she texts her friends and neighbors like, 'OMG you guys, celebrate with me! I found the thing I lost!'"
Luke,15,10,"And I'm like, listen up fam, when just one person decides to turn their life around and repent, it's a total party up in heaven with all the angels. It's all about that joy, you know what I'm saying?"
Luke,15,11,"So, like, there was this dude who had two sons:"
Luke,15,12,"The younger one asks his dad, 'Yo, Dad! Can I get my share of the loot now?' So the dad split his stuff and gave it to both of them."
Luke,15,13,"And, like, not long after that, the younger son got all his stuff and went on a trip to a faraway place. He totally blew all his money on wild parties and stuff."
Luke,15,14,"So, like, this dude was spending all his cash, and then BAM! A major famine hit the land, and suddenly he was totally broke."
Luke,15,15,"So he like went and started hanging out with this local guy in town, and this guy was all like, 'Go take care of my pigs on my land.'"
Luke,15,16,"And he was so hungry that he really wanted to eat the pig's leftovers, but nobody gave him anything."
Luke,15,17,"And like, when he finally woke up and realized what was going on, he was like, 'OMG, my dad's workers have so much food to eat, and here I am starving!'"
Luke,15,18,"I'm gonna get up and head over to my dad, and I'll be like, 'Hey, Dad, I messed up big time, both in the eyes of heaven and in front of you.'"
Luke,15,19,And I don't even deserve to be called your son anymore: just treat me like one of your workers.
Luke,15,20,"So the guy got up and went to his dad. But from pretty far away, his dad spotted him and felt super sorry, so he sprinted over, hugged him tight, and gave him a big smooch."
Luke,15,21,"And the son was like, 'Yo, Dad, I messed up big time. I've totally disappointed heaven and you, and I don't even deserve to be called your son anymore.'"
Luke,15,22,"Yo, listen up, servants! Grab that sickest robe and hook this dude up with it. Oh, and don't forget to slide a dope ring on his hand and some fresh kicks on his feet!"
Luke,15,23,"Yo, go get that prime chunk of meat, slay it, and let's grub and throw a lit party!"
Luke,15,24,"My dude, just peep this: my son was straight-up gone, like, spiritually dead and all. But now, he's back in the game, totally alive! He was lost, like, on some next-level level, but we finally found him. And let me tell you, we all started partying like there's no tomorrow. It was epic!"
Luke,15,25,"So the older son was out in the field, and when he came near the house, he heard some lit music and dancing going on."
Luke,15,26,"So he goes up to one of his peeps, a servant, and is like, 'Yo, what's the deal with all this?'"
Luke,15,27,"And he was like, 'Yo, guess what? Your bro is here and your dad straight up roasted the best calf because he's pumped that he came back in one piece.'"
Luke,15,28,"But he was so mad, he just couldn't go inside. So his dad came out and begged him to come in."
Luke,15,29,"And he was like, yo, dad, I've been serving you for mad years and I never once broke your commandments. But you never gave me a lit party with my homies, not even a little goat, man!"
Luke,15,30,"But once your son came back, who wasted all your money on partying and bad choices, you threw a massive celebration for him."
Luke,15,31,"And he was like, 'Dude, you're always here with me, and everything I've got is totally yours.'"
Luke,15,32,"It was totally lit that we should turn up and be hype, 'cause your bro was straight up gone, but now he's back and we found him, no cap."
Luke,16,1,"So, Jesus was like, 'Listen up, my squad. There was this mega rich dude who had a manager. But then, someone told the rich guy that the manager was totally irresponsible with his stuff.'"
Luke,16,2,"So, like, he called him over and was like, 'Dude, what's the deal with all this talk about you? Explain yourself and all the stuff you're managing, 'cause you might not be in charge much longer.'"
Luke,16,3,"So, like, the steward was all like, what should I do, man? 'Cause my boss is like taking away my job and stuff: I'm totally not cut out for manual labor; and like, begging is just so embarrassing."
Luke,16,4,"I've made up my mind about what to do, so that when I'm no longer in charge, they'll welcome me into their crib."
Luke,16,5,"So he hit up all the bros who owed his boss some dough and asked the first dude, 'Yo, how much you owe to my boss?'"
Luke,16,6,"He said, like, 'I want a hundred measures of oil, bro.' And the guy was like, 'Alright, take your bill and write down fifty real quick, man.' Oh, by the way, a 'measure' back then was like nine gallons and three quarts, just so you know."
Luke,16,7,"Then he asked another person, 'And how much do you owe?' They replied, 'I owe a hundred baskets of wheat.' He told them, 'Take your bill and write eighty.' {Note: A 'measure' in the original language refers to about fourteen bushels and two quarts.}"
Luke,16,8,"And the boss actually praised the shady steward because he was pretty smart about it: yeah, the kids in this world know how to handle things better than the kids who claim to be enlightened."
Luke,16,9,"Yo, listen up! I gotta tell you something real important. Start makin' friends with the dough that comes from shady sources. Why? 'Cause when things go south for you, those friends will welcome you into eternal cribs. (Oh, by the way, 'mammon' means riches.)"
Luke,16,10,"Someone who is loyal in small things will also be loyal in big things, and someone who is unfair in small things will also be unfair in big things."
Luke,16,11,"If you haven't been trustworthy with the big stacks of cash, who's gonna trust you with the real deal riches, fam? #priorities"
Luke,16,12,"And if you haven't been loyal with someone else's stuff, who's gonna hook you up with your own stuff though?"
Luke,16,13,You can't be loyal to two bosses - you'll end up hating one and favoring the other. You can't please God while chasing after materialistic success.
Luke,16,14,"And even the Pharisees, who were all about that money, heard everything he said and straight up roasted him."
Luke,16,15,"And he's like, ya'll are the ones who are all about impressing people and getting validation from them, but God knows what's really in your hearts. Like, all that stuff that society thinks is super important and prestigious? God is actually disgusted by it."
Luke,16,16,"The old rules and prophecies were in play until John came around - but since then, the hype about God's kingdom is real, and everyone's racing to be a part of it."
Luke,16,17,Heaven and earth would have an easier time disappearing than even the smallest part of the law going out of style.
Luke,16,18,"If someone breaks up with their spouse and gets with someone else, they're committing adultery. And if someone gets with a person who just got broken up with, they're also committing adultery."
Luke,16,19,"Once upon a time, there was a super wealthy dude who rocked the freshest purple clothes and looked fly in his luxury linens. And you know what? This dude had lavish feasts every single day like it was no big deal."
Luke,16,20,"So, there was this dude called Lazarus who was a beggar and always chilling by the gate, dealing with mad sores."
Luke,16,21,And craving for those leftover scraps from the fancy people's party: and the dogs came over and licked his wounds.
Luke,16,22,"So like, this beggar dude passed away, and the angels were like, 'We got you, bro,' and took him to hang with Abraham in this super cozy spot. Meanwhile, the rich dude kicked the bucket too, but he ended up getting a traditional burial."
Luke,16,23,"And in hell, he looked up and saw Abraham and Lazarus. They were far away, but he could still see them. He was in so much agony."
Luke,16,24,"And he was like, yo Father Abraham, please show some mercy and ask Lazarus to just touch his finger in water and cool my tongue, 'cause I'm getting wrecked in this flame."
Luke,16,25,"But yo, Abraham was like, 'Dude, check it. Remember when you were all livin' it up, gettin' everything good in life? And Lazarus was chillin' with all them evil things? Well, now things are flipped. He's findin' comfort and you, my friend, are straight up tormented.'"
Luke,16,26,"Yo, listen up! There's, like, a massive gap between us and you that can't be crossed. So basically, anyone tryna go from here to you can't, and vice versa. No way to bridge that distance, fam."
Luke,16,27,"And he was like, yo, dad, can you please send him back to my dad's crib?"
Luke,16,28,"Yo, I got five bros, and I'm just tryna let 'em know what's up so they don't end up in this messed up place of suffering."
Luke,16,29,"Abraham's like, 'Dude, they've got Moses and the prophets. They should totally listen to what they're saying.'"
Luke,16,30,"And he was like, no way, Father Abraham! But like, if someone came back from the dead and talked to them, I'm sure they would totally change their ways."
Luke,16,31,"And he was like, yo, if they don't even listen to Moses and the prophets, they ain't gonna be convinced even if someone comes back from the dead. Like, for real."
Luke,17,1,"So, like, Jesus said to his squad, yo, you gotta know that it's gonna be real tough to avoid people messing up and causing trouble. But, man, it's gonna be seriously rough for those who are actually causing all that drama!"
Luke,17,2,"It would be way better for that person to have a massive millstone tied around their neck and thrown into the ocean, than to hurt any of these young ones."
Luke,17,3,"Listen up, fam: If your bro disrespects you, call him out on it; and if he shows remorse, give him your forgiveness."
Luke,17,4,"But, like, if he totally messes up and wrongs you seven times in one day, and then comes back to you seven times in that same day, saying, 'I'm sorry, I regret it,' you gotta forgive him."
Luke,17,5,"Yo, Lord, we're like fam here, but can you hook us up with some extra faith?"
Luke,17,6,"And God was like, if y'all had faith as tiny as a mustard seed, you could totally tell this sycamine tree, 'Yo, get uprooted and get planted in the sea,' and it would straight up obey you."
Luke,17,7,"Like, seriously, imagine this: if any of you, right, have a servant who's doing hard work in the field or taking care of some animals, would you like, tell them immediately after their shift to just go and chill out and have a good meal? No way, man!"
Luke,17,8,"And won't you just say to him, like, 'Get everything ready so I can chill and get my grub on, then put on your apron and serve me until I'm done eating and drinking, and then you can eat and drink'?"
Luke,17,9,Does he really thank that servant just for doing what he was told? I don't think so.
Luke,17,10,"So, like, when you've done all the stuff that you were told to do, just say, 'We're not even trying to flex or anything, we were just doing our job, you know?'"
Luke,17,11,"So, like, this dude was on his way to Jerusalem, right? And he, like, totally went through Samaria and Galilee, just chilling and stuff."
Luke,17,12,"So, like, Jesus rolls up to this village, right? And there's, like, these ten dudes who have leprosy, standing way, way far away from him."
Luke,17,13,"And they started shouting, like, Jesuss, dude, please have some mercy on us.'"
Luke,17,14,"And when he saw {them}, he was like, 'Yo, go show yourselves to the priests.' So, as they dipped, things started clearing up."
Luke,17,15,"Yo, one of them dudes, when he peeped that he got healed, straight up turned around and started hollerin' at the top of his lungs, giving mad props to God,"
Luke,17,16,"And he like, totally bowed down, faceplanted at his feet, and was like, 'Thank you so much, bro!' And btw, he was a Samaritan, just sayin'."
Luke,17,17,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, didn't I heal ten people? But, like, where are the other nine at?'"
Luke,17,18,"None of the others bothered to thank God for what he did, only this random dude."
Luke,17,19,"And he was like, dude, get up and go: your faith totally made you whole."
Luke,17,20,"So, the Pharisees asked him about when the kingdom of God would show up, and he replied, saying it won't be some grand spectacle or obvious thing. It's not about flashy displays or outward appearances."
Luke,17,21,"Don't go around saying, 'Check this out!' or 'Look over there!' because guess what? The kingdom of God is right here, right among you. {within you: or, among you}"
Luke,17,22,"Yo, listen up, squad! Jesus straight up told his homies, 'Check it, there's gonna be a time when you'll be longing to witness one of the epic days when the Son of man comes through, but unfortunately, you won't be able to witness that."
Luke,17,23,"And they will be like, 'Check it out over here', or 'Look, it's over there': but don't be fooled, don't go chasing after it or following them."
Luke,17,24,"Like, imagine this: lightning strikes from one end of the sky to the other, right? Well, the Son of man is gonna be just as intense when his big day comes, you know?"
Luke,17,25,"But, like, before anything else, he's gonna go through a lot of struggles and get totally rejected by this entire generation."
Luke,17,26,"And like, back in the days of Noe, it's gonna be the same vibe when the Son of man shows up."
Luke,17,27,"They were just vibing, having a feast, sipping on some drinks, tying the knot, and getting hitched, you know? Life was pretty chill until Noe stepped into the ark and the flood came, wiping out everyone."
Luke,17,28,"It went down just like back in Lot's time; people were chillin', grubbin', flexin', tradin', planting, and constructing stuff;"
Luke,17,29,"Just when Lot left Sodom, the skies dropped fire and brimstone, obliterating everyone."
Luke,17,30,"It's gonna go down like this when the Son of man shows up, no cap."
Luke,17,31,"When that day comes, if someone is on the rooftop with their things inside the house, they shouldn't go down to grab them. And if someone is out in the field, they shouldn't turn back either."
Luke,17,32,"Don't forget about Lot's wife, fam."
Luke,17,33,"If you're all about saving your own skin, you'll end up losing it. But if you're willing to let go and take some risks, you'll end up coming out on top."
Luke,17,34,"Yo, listen up. When that night comes, there will be two dudes sharing a bed. One of them will be taken away, while the other one will be left behind."
Luke,17,35,"Two girls chilling together, one gets picked, the other gets left behind."
Luke,17,36,"Picture this: two dudes chilling in the field, and suddenly, one of them gets chosen, and the other one gets passed over. (FYI, some Greek copies don't actually have this verse.)"
Luke,17,37,"And they were like, 'Yo, where, Lord?' And he was like, 'Well, wherever the body is, that's where the eagles will be chillin'."
Luke,18,1,"So, like, Jesus told them a story, you know, to make a point. He was basically saying that we should totally always pray and not let ourselves get weak or give up, ya feel?"
Luke,18,2,"So, like, there was this judge in a city who didn't really care about God or people, you know? Like, he didn't have any fear or respect for any of them. (in a city: It's like, in a random city)"
Luke,18,3,"So, there was this woman who lost her spouse, and she straight up went to him, like 'Yo, help me get back at my enemy!'"
Luke,18,4,"And, like, he didn't want to do it at first, but then he was like, 'Hmm, even though I don't really care about God or other people...'"
Luke,18,5,"But this widow won't stop bothering me, so I'll make sure she gets justice, otherwise she'll keep bugging me and it'll get annoying."
Luke,18,6,"And God was like, listen to what the unfair judge is saying."
Luke,18,7,"Yo, don't you think God's gonna come through for his chosen ones who keep on praying to him day and night? Even if he takes his sweet time, he's gonna make it right, fam."
Luke,18,8,"Just a heads up, God's gonna bring justice real quick for them. But yo, when the Son of man rolls through, is he gonna find anyone with faith left?"
Luke,18,9,"So, Jesus told a story to some people who believed they were totally righteous and looked down on others:"
Luke,18,10,"So, there were these two dudes who went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was, like, a government tax collector."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee was all like, standing there, praying to himself, saying, 'Yo God, props to ya, 'cause I ain't like those other dudes, you know, those sketchy extorters, unfair peeps, cheaters, or even like that publican over there.'"
Luke,18,12,"I'm all about that fasting and tithing game. Twice a week, I'm like, no food, no problem! And hey, when it comes to my earnings, I'm tithing like a boss - giving a tenth of everything I've got. Can't mess with that dedication!"
Luke,18,13,"The dude at the government office, standing far away, didn't even wanna look up at the sky, but was like hitting his chest, saying, 'Yo, God, be nice to me 'cause I messed up, as a sinner and stuff'."
Luke,18,14,"Listen up, fam! Let me break it down for you. This dude who dipped to his crib was the real deal, ya feel me? He was justified, like, way more than the other dude. Why? 'Cause anyone who thinks they're all that will end up lookin' foolish, while the one who stays humble will come out on top. Stay humble, stay winning!"
Luke,18,15,"And people brought babies to Him, hoping that He would bless them with His touch. But the disciples, upon seeing this, scolded those who brought them."
Luke,18,16,"Then Jesus called them over and said, 'Hey, listen up! Let the kids come to me and don't stop them. The kingdom of God belongs to people like them.'"
Luke,18,17,"Listen up, fam! If you ain't embracing God's kingdom with child-like vibes, there's no way you're stepping foot in there."
Luke,18,18,"So, this important guy comes up to Jesus and asks him, like 'Hey, dude, what do I gotta do to score eternal life?'"
Luke,18,19,"Jesus was like, yo, why you callin' me good? Only one who's truly good is God, bro."
Luke,18,20,"You know the deal, right? No hooking up with someone who's taken, no taking someone's life, no swiping other people's stuff, no lying about others, and always respect your folks."
Luke,18,21,"And he was like, dude, I've been keeping all of these things on point since day one."
Luke,18,22,"So like, Jesus heard what was being said and told the guy, 'Dude, you're missing one important thing. Sell all your stuff, give the money to the poor, and boom, you'll have treasure in heaven. Then, come and follow me!'"
Luke,18,23,"And when he heard this, he was super bummed out 'cause he had mad stacks."
Luke,18,24,"And Jesus peeped that the guy was mad sad, so he was like, yo, it's gonna be hella tough for rich peeps to get into God's kingdom, ya know!"
Luke,18,25,"Like, imagine a camel squeezing through the eye of a needle? Well, it's hella hard for a rich dude to get into the Kingdom of God, too."
Luke,18,26,"And those who heard it were like, seriously, who can even be saved?"
Luke,18,27,"And he was like, dude, some things that humans think are totally impossible can actually happen with God."
Luke,18,28,"Yo, Peter was like, 'Yo, we've ditched everything and straight up rolled with you, man.'"
Luke,18,29,"And he's like, seriously guys, listen up, no one – I mean no one – who ditches their crib, their fam, their squad, their bae, or their fam for the sake of God's kingdom,"
Luke,18,30,"Whoever won't get a whole lot more right now, and in the future, will score an endless, awesome life."
Luke,18,31,"And he gathered his squad of twelve and said to them, Listen up fam, we're about to roll into Jerusalem, and every prophecy about the Son of man is gonna go down, just like it's written."
Luke,18,32,"Yo, he's gonna get handed over to the non-Jewish peeps, and they're gonna straight up clown him, treat him like dirt, and spit on him, no cap:"
Luke,18,33,"And they'll totally beat him up and kill him: but on the third day, he's gonna come back to life, legit."
Luke,18,34,"And they were totally clueless about all of this, like they had no idea what was going on. It's like this whole message went right over their heads and they couldn't comprehend a single word that was said."
Luke,18,35,"So, like, Jesus was walking close to Jericho and there was this blind dude chilling by the road, like begging for some help:"
Luke,18,36,"And when he heard all the people passing by, he was like, 'Yo, what's going on? Like, what's the deal here?'"
Luke,18,37,"Yo, they're like, Jesuss of Nazareth is passing by, dude.'"
Luke,18,38,"He yelled, like, Jesuss, bro, you the Son of David, show me some mercy!"
Luke,18,39,"The people in front of him tried to silence him, but he shouted even louder, 'Yo, Son of David, please have mercy on me.'"
Luke,18,40,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, bring that dude over here.' And once he was close, Jesus hit him up with a question,"
Luke,18,41,"He asked, 'What do you want me to do for you?' And the guy was like, 'Yo, Lord, I wanna be able to see again.'"
Luke,18,42,"And Jesus was like, 'Bro, you can totally see now! You got saved because your faith is lit.'"
Luke,18,43,"Right away, he got his vision back and started to roll with Him, giving major props to God. And when everyone saw what happened, they all stanned God and gave Him mad respect."
Luke,19,1,"So, like, Jesus went into Jericho and just cruised through the place."
Luke,19,2,"So, like, there was this dude named Zacchaeus, who was, like, the big boss of the tax collectors, and he was loaded."
Luke,19,3,"So, like, this guy really wanted to see Jesus up close, you know? But dang, it was so crowded and he was, like, short and couldn't see over everyone. Bummer, dude."
Luke,19,4,"And he was like, super excited and ran ahead, climbed up into a sycomore tree just to catch a glimpse of him, 'cause he was totally gonna pass by that spot."
Luke,19,5,"So Jesus arrived at the spot, lifted his gaze, and spotted Zacchaeus. He then said to him, 'Zacchaeus, hurry up and make your way down! I'm crashin' at your place today, no ifs or buts.'"
Luke,19,6,He quickly came down and welcomed him with pure joy.
Luke,19,7,"And when they peeped {it}, they all started whispering, like, 'Dang, he's chillin' with a major sinner.'"
Luke,19,8,"So, Zacchaeus was like, 'Yo, Jesus! Listen up! Check it out, I'm giving away half of my stuff to help those in need. And if I've ever wrongly taken anything from anyone, I promise to give them back not just double, but four times the amount.'"
Luke,19,9,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Bro, your house just scored some major salvation today because you're also a legit descendant of Abraham.'"
Luke,19,10,The Son of man came to find and rescue what was lost.
Luke,19,11,"So, like, as they were listening to all this, he decides to drop a sick parable, you know? 'Cause he was getting close to Jerusalem and everyone was thinking the kingdom of God would just pop up any second."
Luke,19,12,"So, like, there was this dude, right? He decides to peace out to a place hella far away, just to claim his own kingdom and then dip back."
Luke,19,13,"So, this dude gathered his ten homies and gave each of them ten stacks of cash. And he was like, 'Yo, keep grinding until I come back.' Just so you know, a stack is equivalent to twelve ounces and a half, which is worth three pounds two shillings and sixpence if we're talking about five shillings per ounce."
Luke,19,14,"But the people in his city hated him and DM-ed him, saying, 'We don't want this dude to be our leader.'"
Luke,19,15,"So, like, when he came back, after he got the whole kingdom thing, he was like, 'Yo, bring those servants here, the ones I gave the cash to, so I can see how much each of them made from their hustle. (BTW, the cash is silver.)"
Luke,19,16,"And the first one came up, like, 'Yo, Lord, check it out, your pound has literally multiplied by ten!'"
Luke,19,17,"And he was like, 'Yo, great job, my awesome servant! You've been totally loyal and responsible with just a small task. So now, I'm giving you mad authority over ten cities.'"
Luke,19,18,"And then the other person came up and was like, 'Yo, Lord, check it! Your pound is now five pounds!'"
Luke,19,19,"And he was like, yo dude, you should totally be in charge of five whole cities too."
Luke,19,20,"Then someone else came up and said, 'Yo, Lord, check it out, I got your pound right here, all safe and sound, wrapped up like a wrap in a napkin and stuff:'"
Luke,19,21,"Dude, I was totally shook 'cause you're, like, a no-nonsense kind of person. You hustle and pick up stuff you didn't even put down, and you reap the benefits without even planting anything."
Luke,19,22,"And he's like, dude, from what you just said, I'm gonna judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I'm a hardcore dude, like I take stuff that I didn't even put there, and reap what I didn't plant:"
Luke,19,23,"Why didn't you, like, put my money in the bank so when I showed up, I could've gotten back some extra cash? SMH! 🤑 {money: Gr. silver}"
Luke,19,24,"And he was like, yo fam, those peeps standing there should grab that pound from him and give it to the one who's got mad ten pounds."
Luke,19,25,"(And they were like, yo, this guy's got ten pounds.)"
Luke,19,26,"Listen up, fam! Here's the deal: If you got something, you'll get even more. But if you're already low on stuff, you'll lose what little you have. So make sure you're stacking it up, or else you might end up with nada."
Luke,19,27,"But those people who hate the fact that I should be in charge, bring them here, and teach them a lesson in front of me."
Luke,19,28,"And after saying this, he moved ahead, making his way up to Jerusalem."
Luke,19,29,"So, like, Jesus was getting close to this place called Bethphage and Bethany, right by this cool spot called the mount of Olives, and he was like, 'Yo, disciples, go on ahead.'"
Luke,19,30,"So, like, go to the village across from you, you know? When you get there, you'll see a colt that's tied up, and no one has ever ridden it before. Just untie it and bring it here, dude."
Luke,19,31,"And if someone asks you, like, why are you untying that dude? then just tell them, yo, the Lord needs him."
Luke,19,32,So the ones who were sent went on their way and found exactly what he had told them.
Luke,19,33,"And while they were untying the colt, the peeps who owned it were like, 'Yo, why you untying the colt, fam?'"
Luke,19,34,"And they were like, yo, the Lord's got plans for that guy."
Luke,19,35,"And they like, brought him to Jesus and like, put their clothes on the colt and like, sat Jesus on it."
Luke,19,36,"And as he walked, they flexed their outfits on the path."
Luke,19,37,"As he got closer to the bottom of the Mount of Olives, all the disciples started freaking out and shouting praises to God for all the epic miracles they witnessed!"
Luke,19,38,"They were like, 'Wow, let's give a big shoutout to the King who's coming in the name of the Lord! May everyone in heaven be chillin' in peace, and highest respect to Him for all the glory! 🙌🌟"
Luke,19,39,"And then, like, some of the Pharisees were, like, totally coming at him, saying, 'Hey, dude, you gotta put your disciples in check, you know?'"
Luke,19,40,"And he responded, like, guys, seriously, if these people stop talking, the stones themselves would start screaming. No joke."
Luke,19,41,"As he got closer, he looked at the city and started crying."
Luke,19,42,"Yo, like, if you had known, like, even you, at least on this day of yours, the things that could bring you peace! But now, like, they're all hidden from your eyes, dude."
Luke,19,43,"Yo, there's gonna be a time when your haters gonna surround you, build a barricade, and trap you from all directions."
Luke,19,44,"They're gonna bring you down to the ground and wreck everything, even your own circle. Nothing will be left standing in your midst because you completely missed out on recognizing the moment when you were given a chance."
Luke,19,45,"So, he goes into the temple and straight up kicks out all the people making bank there, both the sellers and the buyers. Like, talk about a power move!"
Luke,19,46,"Jesus was like, 'Listen up, fam. The scripture says my crib is a sanctuary for prayer, but y'all turned it into a straight-up thieves' lair! Ain't cool, yo.'"
Luke,19,47,"So, basically, this guy was dropping knowledge bombs in the temple every single day. But, get this, the higher-ups - the chief priests, scribes, and the big shots - were out to cancel him big time."
Luke,19,48,"And they couldn't figure out what to do, because everyone was totally vibing with his message. {were...: or, hanging onto every word he said}"
Luke,20,1,"So, like, one day Jesus was doing his thing, teaching peeps at the temple and getting his preach on. And then bam, the chief priests, scribes, and elders show up like, 'Yo, what's up?'"
Luke,20,2,"So they asked him, like, who do you think you are? Like, what's your authority to be doing all these things? Who gave you the power to do this?"
Luke,20,3,"Yo, I gotta question for y'all too, so peep this - can you answer me back?"
Luke,20,4,"Yo, was John's baptism legit? Like, was it from heaven, or just some human-made thing?"
Luke,20,5,"And they were like, trying to figure it out, saying, If we say it's from heaven, he'll be like, yo why didn't you believe him then?"
Luke,20,6,"But like, if we say, 'It's just some human thing,' then everyone will totally freak out and start throwing stones at us because they all believe that John was a legit prophet."
Luke,20,7,"And they were like, 'I don't even know where that came from.'"
Luke,20,8,"And Jesus was like, I'm not gonna spill the tea on where I get my power from, fam."
Luke,20,9,"So this guy starts telling a story to the crowd, right? He's like, there's this dude who planted a vineyard and rented it to some workers. Then he goes off to another country, like, for a really long time."
Luke,20,10,"Then, at that time, he sent one of his dudes to the farmers, asking them to hook him up with some fresh vineyard produce: but the farmers straight-up beat him down and sent him away with nothing."
Luke,20,11,"Then he sent another servant again, but they ended up beating him too, treating him terribly, and sending him away with nothing."
Luke,20,12,"Then he sent a third person once more, but they ended up hurting them too and kicked them out."
Luke,20,13,"So the guy who owned the vineyard was like, 'Hmm, what should I do now?' And then he was like, 'I got an idea! I'll send my awesome son, maybe they'll finally start giving him some respect when they see how rad he is.'"
Luke,20,14,"But when the farmers saw him, they were like, 'Yo, this guy right here is the rightful heir. Let's do something shady and eliminate him, so we can score the inheritance.'"
Luke,20,15,"So they kicked him out of the vineyard and killed him. So, what's the plan for the vineyard owner now?"
Luke,20,16,"He's gonna come and totally wreck those farmers, then hand over the vineyard to other people. And when they heard that, they were like, 'No way, God! That's not cool.'"
Luke,20,17,"So, he saw them and was like, 'Yo, what's up with this? Haven't you read about that stone the builders dissed, but ended up being the main event?'"
Luke,20,18,"Anyone who messes with that stone is gonna get wrecked, but if that stone messes with them, it's gonna obliterate them."
Luke,20,19,"Yo, at that moment, the high priests and the scribes were all like tryna catch this dude, but they were low-key scared of the crowd. They knew deep down that he was throwing shade at them with that parable."
Luke,20,20,"So they kept a close eye on him and sent out spies pretending to be righteous individuals, hoping to catch him saying something incriminating, all in order to hand him over to the governor's control and authority."
Luke,20,21,"And they were like, 'Yo, teacher, we know you always spittin' truth and stayin' real. You don't play favorites and you teach us about the real deal with God. No cap.'"
Luke,20,22,"Yo, is it cool for us to pay taxes to Caesar or what?"
Luke,20,23,"But he saw through their sneaky moves, and said to them, Why are you trying to test me?"
Luke,20,24,"Yo, can you show me a penny? Whose face and text is on it? And they were like, 'Caesar's, duh.'"
Luke,20,25,"And he was like, yo listen up, give to Caesar what's his and give to God what's His."
Luke,20,26,"And, like, they totally couldn't even handle what he was saying in front of everyone: they were like, so amazed by his response, so they just shut up."
Luke,20,27,"So, this group of Sadducees approached {him}, you know the ones who don't believe in any kind of resurrection; and they hit him with a question,"
Luke,20,28,"So, like, they were asking Jesus, 'Yo, teach us, like, Moses wrote this rule, right? He said that if a dude's brother dies but he had a wife and no kids, then his brother should marry her and, like, have kids to carry on his bro's legacy.'"
Luke,20,29,"So, there were these seven bros, right? And the oldest one got hitched, but unfortunately, he kicked the bucket before having any kids. Bummer, man."
Luke,20,30,"Then the second guy decided to marry her too, but they didn't have any kids and he eventually passed away."
Luke,20,31,"Then the third one snagged her too, and the same thing happened with the seven others: they didn't have any kids and eventually died."
Luke,20,32,"And finally, the woman passed away too."
Luke,20,33,"So, in the resurrection, like, which one of them will be her husband, you know? 'Cause she had, like, seven husbands in her lifetime."
Luke,20,34,"Jesus replied to them, Peoplee in this day and age get hitched and tie the knot, like, all the time, you know? Like, they take the plunge and say 'I do,' and it's a whole big shindig.'"
Luke,20,35,"But those who are considered worthy of attaining that epic world and rising from the dead, won't be tying the knot or getting hitched:"
Luke,20,36,"And like, they can't even die anymore, ya know? They're totally on the same level as angels and stuff. They're God's kids, 'cause they rose up from the dead and all."
Luke,20,37,"So, like, imagine this, yo. It's all about the resurrection, right? So, Moses, way back in the day, he drops some wisdom at the burning bush. He straight-up calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, you feel me?"
Luke,20,38,"He's not about that dead life - He's all about the living! 'Cause everybody's living it up, in his eyes."
Luke,20,39,"And like, some of the scribes were all like, 'Yo, Master, you totally nailed it with what you just said!'"
Luke,20,40,And then they didn't dare to ask him any {more questions}.
Luke,20,41,"So like, he asked them, how do people say that Christ is like David's son or what?"
Luke,20,42,"And yo, David straight up says in the Psalms, the LORD was like to my OG, chill and take a seat on my right side,"
Luke,20,43,Until I completely own your haters like a boss and make them bow down to you.
Luke,20,44,"So David is like, calling him Lordd'. How can he also be his son?"
Luke,20,45,"So, like, in front of everyone, he started talking to his disciples,"
Luke,20,46,"Yo, watch out for those scribes, man. They be all about flexin' their long robes, seeking recognition in the hustle and bustle of the markets, and fighting for the top spots in the synagogues and flashy places at feasts."
Luke,20,47,"They straight up flex on how religious they are, but low-key scam widows outta their homes. Like, seriously, they're gonna get mega consequences for that."
Luke,21,1,"So he looked up and saw these rich dudes flexin', straight up tossin' their donations into the collection box."
Luke,21,2,"So, like, he noticed this one widow who was really struggling financially and she, like, dropped in two tiny coins into the offering box."
Luke,21,3,"Yo, for real, I gotta tell you something. This legit broke widow just dropped a bigger amount than all these peeps combined."
Luke,21,4,"Like, everyone else was just casually tossing in their extra cash to the offerings of God, but this one girl, she straight up gave everything she had, even though she was broke af."
Luke,21,5,"And as some were talking about the temple, like, how it was decked out with fancy stones and dope presents, he was like,"
Luke,21,6,Listen up! What you see here will be totally wrecked in the future. Not a single stone will be left standing on another.
Luke,21,7,"And they were like, yo, teacher, when is all this gonna go down? And like, what's the sign we should look out for when it's about to happen?"
Luke,21,8,"Yo, listen up and be careful not to get tricked, 'cause there's gonna be a bunch of people coming around claiming they're me, like, 'Yo, I'm the real deal!'. But don't fall for it, 'cause the end times are coming, yo! Don't follow after those imposters, alright?"
Luke,21,9,"But when you hear about conflicts and chaos, don't freak out: 'cause this stuff's gotta happen first; but it's not gonna be over just like that."
Luke,21,10,"And he was like, yo guys, there's gonna be mad conflicts between countries, like nation against nation, and even kingdoms fighting kingdoms, you feel me?"
Luke,21,11,"So, like, there's gonna be some major earthquakes happening all over the place, and, like, there'll be famines and pestilences too. And, get this, there's gonna be these totally frightening sights and massive signs appearing in the sky."
Luke,21,12,"But before all this goes down, they're gonna come after you, like seriously lay their hands on you and persecute you. You're gonna be snatched up and dragged into the synagogues and prisons, for real. And get this, you'll even end up in front of all these big-shot kings and rulers just because you're repping my name."
Luke,21,13,"And it's gonna be, like, your cool way of telling others about it."
Luke,21,14,"So, like, chill out and keep this in mind, fam: Don't stress about what to say when you gotta respond to something."
Luke,21,15,"I got you covered, fam! I'll bless you with straight-up mad skills and wisdom that'll leave your haters speechless and powerless to come back at you."
Luke,21,16,"And like, dude, just so you know, your parents, siblings, relatives, and even friends might totally betray you, and like, it's real messed up but some of you might even end up getting straight up killed."
Luke,21,17,"And everyone is gonna straight up hate on you just because you're reppin' me, like, my name bein' involved and all."
Luke,21,18,But not even a single strand of your hair will be harmed.
Luke,21,19,"Just chill and keep it together, yo, and you'll totally own your souls, no doubt."
Luke,21,20,"And when you peep Jerusalem all surrounded by armies, you'll know that destruction is right around the corner."
Luke,21,21,"Yo, if you're in Judaea, peace out to the mountains ASAP. And if you're chillin' in the middle of it, GTFO. And for real, don't even think about entering if you're from the nearby areas."
Luke,21,22,"These days are all about seekin' revenge, so that everything that's been written can come true."
Luke,21,23,It's gonna be tough for those who are expecting or taking care of infants during that time! The land is gonna be in a major crisis and this whole community will face some serious anger.
Luke,21,24,"And they're gonna get wrecked in battles and taken prisoner all over the place, and Jerusalem will get trampled on by non-Jews, until the non-Jew era is finished."
Luke,21,25,"Like, there will be legit signs appearin' in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth, countries will be super stressed and confused; the ocean and waves will be like, totally roarrrin'!"
Luke,21,26,"People buggin' out 'cause they scared AF, stressin' 'bout the crazy stuff happenin' on earth. Brace yourself 'cause even the heavenly powers gonna get rocked."
Luke,21,27,And then they gonna witness the Son of man rollin' up in a cloud with mad power and insane glory.
Luke,21,28,"And when all this starts happening, just look up and raise your heads; because your salvation is getting closer."
Luke,21,29,"So Jesus tells them a cool story: Check out that fig tree over there, and all the other trees too!"
Luke,21,30,"When you see plants blooming, you can tell that summer is right around the corner, no doubt."
Luke,21,31,"Okay, listen up fam. When you peeps witness all these things go down, just know that the kingdom of God is like, totally about to happen soon. So, get ready and stay woke, my dudes."
Luke,21,32,"I'm telling you for real, guys, this crew right here won't be gone until every single thing goes down as planned."
Luke,21,33,"Like, heaven and earth might fade away, but my words are gonna stay, no doubt."
Luke,21,34,"Yo, make sure you watch yourselves, like seriously, don't let yourselves get weighed down by stuffing your faces, getting wasted, and stressing about this worldly life, because the day might just creep up on you outta nowhere, no cap."
Luke,21,35,"Yo, it's gonna come at everybody on this whole earth like a major trap, no cap."
Luke,21,36,"So like, make sure to stay woke and stay praying all the time, so that you can be considered to be worth escaping all the stuff that's gonna happen, and stand before the Son of man."
Luke,21,37,"During the day, he was dropping mad knowledge in the temple, and at night, he dipped and crashed at this lit place called the mount of Olives."
Luke,21,38,"And like, hella people showed up super early in the morning to chill with him at the temple, just to listen to what he had to say."
Luke,22,1,"So, the time for the feast of unleavened bread was almost here, also known as Passover."
Luke,22,2,"So, like, the top religious guys and scholars were totally plotting how to get rid of him, 'cause they were scared of all the people who were down for him."
Luke,22,3,"So then, like, Satan totally took over Judas, that dude with the last name Iscariot, you know, who was one of the twelve disciples and all."
Luke,22,4,"And he dipped out, and reached out to the top religious homies and squad leaders, brainstorming how he could sell him out to them."
Luke,22,5,"And they were stoked, and agreed to slide him some cash."
Luke,22,6,"And he was like, totally down to betray him when the crowd wasn't around. No drama or anything, just sneakily handing him over to them."
Luke,22,7,"So, it was time for the unleavened bread day, when we had to slaughter the passover lamb."
Luke,22,8,"So, Jesus texted Peter and John, like, 'Hey guys, go get the passover stuff ready for us to eat.'"
Luke,22,9,"And they were like, 'Yo, where do you want us to get everything ready, though?'"
Luke,22,10,"And he was like, yo listen up, once you step foot into the city, this dude will come up to you holding a water bottle. Just roll with him and go into the crib where he goes."
Luke,22,11,"Yo, talkin' to the homie in charge here. The Boss wants to know, where's the spot for the sesh? Gonna grub on that passover feast with my crew, ya feel?"
Luke,22,12,He'll hook you up with a sick loft that's fully decked out: set it up there.
Luke,22,13,"So they went and, just as he had told them, found everything ready for the Passover."
Luke,22,14,"And when it was time, he plopped down and the squad of twelve apostles joined him."
Luke,22,15,"And he was like, guys, I really, really wanted to eat this passover with you before I go through all that suffering stuff: {like, really wanted...: or, I've been sooo excited}"
Luke,22,16,"Listen up, fam! Just so you know, I won't be chowing down on that anymore until it's all been totally fulfilled in God's kingdom. Trust!"
Luke,22,17,"Then he grabbed the cup, said thanks, and was like, 'Yo, take this and split it among you all:'"
Luke,22,18,"Yo, listen up. Just so you know, I'm not gonna have a sip of that grape juice until the kingdom of God arrives. #keepingitreal"
Luke,22,19,"Then he grabbed some bread, said a quick thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, like, 'This is my body, yo, sacrificed for you. Remember me by doing this.'"
Luke,22,20,"Then, after we finished eating, Jesus took the cup and said, 'This cup represents the new agreement between God and humanity. It symbolizes my blood, which I'm sacrificing for all of you.'"
Luke,22,21,"Yo, check it out, the person who's about to betray me is actually at this table with me right now."
Luke,22,22,"And like, for real, the Son of man is heading out, just like it was legit planned and all. But man, it's gonna suck big time for the one who betrays him!"
Luke,22,23,"And they were like, totally wondering between themselves, like who was gonna do this thing, you know?"
Luke,22,24,"So, like, there was some serious drama going on among them, cuz they were all trying to flex and prove that they were the absolute GOAT."
Luke,22,25,"And he was like, yo, the kings of the Gentiles, they're all about being in control and stuff, and the ones who boss people around act like they're doing them a favor and all that."
Luke,22,26,"But you don't have to be like that: instead, the one who wants to be great among you should be like the younger ones, and the one who wants to be the leader should be like the one who serves."
Luke,22,27,"Yo, who do you think is more important - the one sitting down to eat, or the one serving the food? Obviously, it's the person sitting down, right? But here's the deal: I'm right here with you, playing the role of the one serving."
Luke,22,28,You guys are the real ones who stuck by me during all my struggles and tough times.
Luke,22,29,"And I'm giving you a kingdom, just like my Dad gave me one;"
Luke,22,30,"So you can grub and sip at my table in my kingdom, and chill on thrones, deciding on the homies from the twelve tribes of Israel."
Luke,22,31,"Yo, Simon, Simon, listen up, Satan's been eyeing you, wanting to test you like separating wheat from chaff:"
Luke,22,32,"Yo, don't trip, I've got you covered with my prayers! I'm making sure your faith stays strong. And once you've come around, it's time to lift up your crew and make them stronger too."
Luke,22,33,"And he was like, 'Yo, I'm down to roll with you, even if it means going to jail or straight up dying.'"
Luke,22,34,"And he was like, yo Peter, listen up. Like, before the morning alarm goes off, you gonna deny me not once, not twice, but three times, bro."
Luke,22,35,"And he was like, yo, remember when I sent you out without any money, bags, or fresh kicks? Did you guys need anything? And they were like, nah, we were good, didn't need a thing."
Luke,22,36,"So basically, this guy was like, 'Listen up fam. If you've got a purse, bring it along with your bag. And if you don't have a sword, sell your clothes and cop one.'"
Luke,22,37,"Yo, listen up! Check it out, fam. Let me lay down some truth for you. This written prophecy about me, it's about to go down, all right? Just as it was said, I'm gonna be considered one of the wrongdoers. But don't trip, 'cause the events revolving around me will eventually come to a close."
Luke,22,38,"And they were like, Yo Lord, check it out, we got two swords. And he was like, That's cool, we good with that."
Luke,22,39,"Then he dipped, headed toward the chill spot on the Mount of Olives; and his homies were right there beside him."
Luke,22,40,"And when he got there, he told them, y'all better pray that you don't get caught up in any tempting situations."
Luke,22,41,"And he distanced himself from them, just like the length of a throwing stone away, and knelt down, and had a heart-to-heart with God,"
Luke,22,42,"He said, Yo, Dad, if you're down, can you, like, take away this whole situation from me? But, like, ultimately, I want what you want, not what I want. Let your will be done, ya know? {willing, remove: Gr. willing to remove}"
Luke,22,43,"And then this cool angel showed up from the heavens, totally giving him a power boost."
Luke,22,44,"In the midst of intense struggle, he prayed with even greater fervor, and his sweat was like huge drops of blood falling to the ground."
Luke,22,45,"And when he finished praying and went back to his squad, he saw them knocked out from all the stress and sadness."
Luke,22,46,"He was like, 'Yo, why are you all sleeping? Wake up and pray, or else you're gonna get tempted.'"
Luke,22,47,"And as he was talking, suddenly a bunch of people showed up, and this guy named Judas, one of the twelve, came up to Jesus and got close to him like he was gonna give him a kiss."
Luke,22,48,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Judas, you really out here betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?'"
Luke,22,49,"When the squad saw what was about to go down, they asked him, 'Yo, Lord, should we swing the sword?'"
Luke,22,50,"And one of them, like, totally attacked the servant of the high priest and, bam, chopped off his right ear."
Luke,22,51,"And Jesus was like, 'Just hold up for a sec, alright?' Then he reached out and touched the dude's ear, and made it all better."
Luke,22,52,"So Jesus was like, 'Yo, why y'all comin' at me all armed and ready, acting like I'm some kinda thief? Chief priests, temple captains, and elders, explain yourselves.'"
Luke,22,53,"Back in the day when I used to hang with y'all at the temple, none of you even tried to lay a finger on me. But guess what, this is the moment you've been waiting for — the darkness got some serious power up in here."
Luke,22,54,So they grabbed him and took him to the high priest's crib. And Peter was low-key trailing behind.
Luke,22,55,"And like, they made a fire in the middle of the hall, and they all sat together, and Peter sat down with them."
Luke,22,56,"So, this girl noticed him chilling by the fire, and was totally checking him out. She straight up said, ""Yo, this dude was hanging with him too."""
Luke,22,57,"And he was like, 'Nah, I don't know her, bro.'"
Luke,22,58,"Then, a little later, someone else noticed him and said, 'Hey, you're one of them too!' But Peter was like, 'Nah, dude, I'm not.'"
Luke,22,59,"And like, an hour later, some people started saying with total confidence, 'Yo, this dude is definitely with him too, like no doubt, because he's from Galilee.'"
Luke,22,60,"And Peter was like, dude, I have no idea what you're talking about. And right away, while he was still talking, the rooster made some noise."
Luke,22,61,"And then God turned and made eye contact with Peter. Suddenly, everything came rushing back to Peter's mind. He remembered what God had told him: 'Before the clock strikes, you will deny me three times.'"
Luke,22,62,"And Peter totally broke down, like, he was crying so hard."
Luke,22,63,And the guys who had Jesus totally trolled him and straight up hit him.
Luke,22,64,"And like, they covered his eyes, and slapped him in the face, and were all like, 'Yo, tell us who hit you.'"
Luke,22,65,And they spoke disrespectfully about him in many other ways.
Luke,22,66,"So when morning came, the OGs of the squad, the head priests, and the word nerds all joined forces and took him to their meeting, like,"
Luke,22,67,"Are you the chosen one, fam? Let us know. And he's like, if I spill the tea, y'all won't even believe it smh:"
Luke,22,68,"And like, even if I ask you, you won't even answer me or let me bounce."
Luke,22,69,"From now on, the Son of Man's gonna be chillin' on God's right-hand side with all the power."
Luke,22,70,"So they all asked, like, are you really the Son of God? And he was like, yeah, that's what you all say."
Luke,22,71,"And they were like, 'Why do we even need more witnesses? We heard it straight from the source!'"
Luke,23,1,"Then like, all of them got up and took him to Pilate, you know?"
Luke,23,2,"And they started calling him out, saying, 'We caught this guy, like, totally stirring up trouble among our people and telling everyone not to pay taxes to Caesar. He even claims to be the King, the chosen one!'"
Luke,23,3,"Pilate was like, 'Yo, are you the King of the Jews?' And the guy was like, 'Yeah, you said it.'"
Luke,23,4,"Pilate was like, 'Yo, chief priests and peeps! No cap, I don't see any flaws in this dude.'"
Luke,23,5,"And they were totally intense, like, they got mad and were like, 'OMG, he's causing such a ruckus! He's, like, teaching all over the place, from Galilee and stuff, all the way to this spot.'"
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate found out the guy was from Galilee, he was like, 'Wait, is he a Galilaean?!"
Luke,23,7,"And once he found out that he was under Herod's power, he handed him over to Herod, who happened to be in Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,"When Herod spotted Jesus, he was super stoked because he had been wanting to see him for a long time. He had heard so many things about Jesus and was hoping to witness one of his epic miracles."
Luke,23,9,"So like, he asked him a bunch of stuff, but the dude didn't say anything back."
Luke,23,10,"And, like, the big shots, you know, the high priests and those smart guys, they totally went all out and started throwing mad accusations at him."
Luke,23,11,"And Herod and his squad totally disrespected him, straight up made fun of him, and dressed him in this fancy robe, then sent him back to Pilate."
Luke,23,12,"And like, on that very day, Pilate and Herod, like, totally became bros, you know? 'Cause, before that, they were, like, straight up enemies and stuff."
Luke,23,13,"So Pilate was like, 'Yo, gather up all the top religious peeps and leaders and the whole crowd too,"
Luke,23,14,"I was like, y'all brought this dude to me, saying he's corrupting the crowd. But guess what? I grilled him real good and couldn't find any fault in him regarding the accusations y'all make."
Luke,23,15,"Nah, not even Herod, dude. I was the one who sent you to him, and like, honestly, he hasn't done anything that deserves the death penalty, ya know?"
Luke,23,16,"So, I'm gonna punish him a bit, but then I'll let him go."
Luke,23,17,(Because he was obligated to let one of them go during the feast.)
Luke,23,18,"And they were all like, 'Get rid of this dude and give us Barabbas instead:'"
Luke,23,19,"(So basically, this dude got thrown in jail for starting trouble and, you know, committing murder.)"
Luke,23,20,"So Pilate, like, he wanted to let Jesus go, and so he talked to them again, you know?"
Luke,23,21,"But they were like, 'Yo, crucify him, crucify him.'"
Luke,23,22,"Then he said to them once again, like, why, what bad did he really do? I've honestly found no legit reason to condemn him to death. So I guess I'll just punish him a bit and set him free, no biggie."
Luke,23,23,"And they were like totally yelling at the top of their lungs, demanding that he be crucified. And their voices, along with the chief priests, ended up having a major impact."
Luke,23,24,So Pilate agreed to their demands.
Luke,23,25,"So, like, he set free the guy who was thrown into jail for causing trouble and killing someone, just because the people wanted it. But unfortunately, he handed Jesus over to them, and let them do whatever they wanted with him."
Luke,23,26,"While they were taking him away, they grabbed this guy named Simon, who was from Cyrene and just happened to be passing by. They made him carry the cross so that Jesus didn't have to."
Luke,23,27,"A bunch of peeps, especially fam and queens, rolled with him and straight up couldn't hold back their feels and were like mourning and crying for him."
Luke,23,28,"Yo, listen up, chicas of Jerusalem! Don't shed tears for me, but instead, shed tears for yourselves and your peeps."
Luke,23,29,"Yo, listen up! The days are coming when peeps gonna be like, 'Yo, big respect to those who don't have kids, and to those who couldn't have 'em or choose not to breastfeed!'"
Luke,23,30,"And they'll be like, 'Yo, mountains, just come crashing down on us!' and to the hills, they'll be saying, 'Yo, cover us up real quick!'"
Luke,23,31,"Yo, if they're out here doing this stuff when things are chill, imagine how they'll act when things get messed up!"
Luke,23,32,"And there were like these two other guys, like, criminals or something, you know? And they were, like, taken with him to be, like, killed."
Luke,23,33,"So, when they finally reached the spot called Calvary, that's where they put him on the cross along with two other criminals. One on his right and the other on his left. {Calvary: or, The place of a skull}"
Luke,23,34,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, Father, please forgive these peeps, 'cause they have no clue what they're doin'. Meanwhile, they be dividing up his clothes and gamblin' for 'em.'"
Luke,23,35,"And all the people were watching. Even the leaders mocked him, saying, 'He saved other people, so if he's really the chosen one, let him save himself.'"
Luke,23,36,"The soldiers straight up made fun of him, coming up to him with a drink and being all like, 'Hey, have some vinegar, bro,'"
Luke,23,37,"And like, they were all like, 'If you're the boss of the Jewish peeps, why don't you, like, save yourself?"
Luke,23,38,"And there was this thing written over Him in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, saying, THIS DUDE IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Luke,23,39,"And one of the guys who were hanged next to him started dissing him, saying, 'If you're really the Messiah, then prove it by saving yourself and us too!'"
Luke,23,40,"But the other dude clapped back, like, bro, don't you even respect God? We're both in this messed up situation, man!"
Luke,23,41,"Like, we totally deserve this, you know? We're getting what we deserve for our actions, but this dude right here, he's actually done nothing wrong."
Luke,23,42,"And he was like, yo Jesus, bro, remember me when you roll into your kingdom."
Luke,23,43,"And Jesus was like, yo bro, I'm telling you for real, today you gonna be kickin' it with me in paradise."
Luke,23,44,"So like, it was around noon, and suddenly it got really dark all over the place until like three in the afternoon."
Luke,23,45,"Dude, the sun went all dark, and guess what? That temple curtain totally got torn right down the middle!"
Luke,23,46,"And when Jesus screamed super loud, he was like, 'Yo, Dad, I'm entrusting my spirit to you!' After saying that, he, like, passed away."
Luke,23,47,"Yo, when the centurion peeped what went down, he was like, 'Damn, this dude was legit!' He straight up praised God, saying, 'No doubt, my man was righteous as hell.'"
Luke,23,48,"And when all the people gathered to witness what was happening, they were like totally shook and started hitting their chests in amazement, and then bounced outta there."
Luke,23,49,"And all his crew, and the girls that rolled with him from Galilee, stayed back, peeping this scene from a distance."
Luke,23,50,"Yo, check it out, there was this dude named Joseph, he was like wise and all, a real stand-up guy, ya know?"
Luke,23,51,"This dude didn't agree with what the others were planning and doing. He was from Arimathaea, a city where the Jews live. And get this, he was actually looking forward to the kingdom of God too."
Luke,23,52,This dude went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
Luke,23,53,"And he like, took it down, and like, wrapped it in linen, and placed it in this totally epic tomb that was carved out of stone, and like, nobody had ever been laid there before."
Luke,23,54,"So, like, it was the day before some important stuff, you know? And the sabbath was about to start."
Luke,23,55,"And the girls who were chillin' with him from Galilee, they were rollin' too and checked out the tomb, and saw how his body was laid."
Luke,23,56,So they went back and got some cool fragrances and oils; then they took some time off on the Sabbath day as instructed.
Luke,24,1,"So, on the first day of the week, super early in the morning, they went to the tomb with the spices they had ready, along with some other peeps."
Luke,24,2,And then they saw that the stone was moved away from the tomb.
Luke,24,3,"So they went inside, but couldn't find Jesus' body."
Luke,24,4,"So, like, things were getting really confusing for them, and then suddenly, two dudes in these super bright outfits showed up right next to them:"
Luke,24,5,"So, they were totally freaked out and like, face-planted on the ground, right? And they were all like, 'Um, why are you searching for someone who's alive in a place for dead peeps? Like, what's up with that?'}"
Luke,24,6,"He's not here, he's risen! Remember when he was in Galilee, what he told you?"
Luke,24,7,"Yo, listen up. So basically, they were like, yo, this dude called the Son of man gotta get handed over to these sinful dudes, right? And then they gonna straight up crucify him, like no joke. But check it, on the third day, homie gonna rise again. Outta the depths, man. It's gonna be epic."
Luke,24,8,"And they, like, totally recalled what he had said,"
Luke,24,9,"And they went back from the grave and told everyone, including the eleven disciples and others, about everything that happened."
Luke,24,10,"So, it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary (the mother of James), and some more women who were with them, who spilled the tea to the apostles about what went down."
Luke,24,11,"And they thought what they said was just a bunch of nonsense, so they totally didn't believe it."
Luke,24,12,"So Peter got up and sprinted to the tomb; when he bent down, he saw the linen clothes neatly laid out, and then he left, totally mind-blown by what just went down."
Luke,24,13,"So, listen up, two of them decided to head over to this village called Emmaus on the same day, which was around 60 furlongs away from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,14,"And they were like, talking and vibing about all these crazy things that went down."
Luke,24,15,"So, like, as they were all talking and discussing stuff, Jesus himself came up and joined them."
Luke,24,16,But they were totally clueless and didn't recognize him at all.
Luke,24,17,"And he's like, 'Yo, what's up with y'all's convo as you're walking and looking all bummed out?'"
Luke,24,18,"So, like, this dude named Cleopas was like, 'Yo, are you, like, the only one who doesn't know what went down in Jerusalem these days? You, like, just passing through or something?'"
Luke,24,19,"And he was like, 'Oh, what's up? What's the tea?' And they were all like, 'So we're talking about this Jesus from Nazareth, who was like a total boss, both in his actions and his words, like for real, in front of God and all the people."
Luke,24,20,"So, like, the main priests and our rulers totally handed him over to be sentenced to death, and then they went ahead and crucified him."
Luke,24,21,"So, like, we totally thought he was gonna be the one to save Israel. And, on top of that, it's been three days since all this stuff went down."
Luke,24,22,"Like, there were these women in our crew who totally blew our minds! They were up real early and went to the tomb and it was just mind-blowing, you know?"
Luke,24,23,"So, like, they couldn't find his body, and they all came and were like, 'Dude, we totally saw angels and they were like, he's alive and stuff!'"
Luke,24,24,"So, some of us went to the grave, and yeah, it was exactly how the girls had said. But, they didn't see him."
Luke,24,25,"And he was like, come on y'all, seriously? Can't believe you're still doubtin' everything the prophets said:"
Luke,24,26,Shouldn't Christ have totally gone through all this suffering and then level up to his glory?
Luke,24,27,"So, this dude Jesus started from the beginning, like Moses and all the prophets, and explained to them everything in the scriptures that was about him."
Luke,24,28,"And they arrived at the village they were heading to, and He pretended like He was going to keep going."
Luke,24,29,"But they were like, 'Yo, stay with us, man! It's getting late and the day's almost over. So he was like, 'Sure, why not?' and chilled with them."
Luke,24,30,"So, like, Jesus was totally chilling and having a meal with his peeps, right? And then he grabbed some bread and blessed it and broke it, and then handed it to everyone there."
Luke,24,31,"And OMG, suddenly their eyes were wide open, and they totally recognized him; but then he basically disappeared right in front of them. Like, he was there one sec and then POOF, gone!"
Luke,24,32,"And they were like, dude, didn't you feel that fire in our hearts when he was chilling with us on the journey and breaking down the scriptures?"
Luke,24,33,"And they like, immediately got up and went back to Jerusalem, and found the squad of eleven and their homies all gathered together,"
Luke,24,34,"He's back, you won't believe it! The Lord has risen for real and showed up to Simon."
Luke,24,35,"And they were like, telling everyone about what went down on the journey, and how they recognized him when he broke bread with them."
Luke,24,36,"And as they were talking, Jesus himself appeared among them and said, 'Yo, peace to all of you'."
Luke,24,37,"But, like, they were totally freaked out and scared AF, thinking they had just seen a ghost or something."
Luke,24,38,"And he's like, yo, why y'all so shook? Why you letting your minds go wild with all these thoughts?"
Luke,24,39,"Check out my hands and feet, it's really me, I promise! Go ahead, touch me and see for yourself. I'm not some spooky ghost without a body like you think, look, I've got flesh and bones just like you see."
Luke,24,40,"And when he said that, he showed them his hands and his feet."
Luke,24,41,"And even though they were super stoked but couldn't believe it, and were totally mind-blown, he asked them, 'Do you guys have any food to eat right here?'"
Luke,24,42,Then they handed him some grilled fish and a chunk of honeycomb.
Luke,24,43,And he grabbed it and straight up devoured it right in front of them.
Luke,24,44,"And he was like, yo guys, listen up. These are the things I told you when I was still chillin' with you. Like, everything that was written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, it's all about me and it's gotta happen."
Luke,24,45,"Then He like totally made them, like, really get it, so they could, like, totally understand what the scriptures were saying, you know?"
Luke,24,46,"And He told them, 'This is what was written, and this is how it had to happen: Christ had to go through suffering and then rise from the dead on the third day.'"
Luke,24,47,"So like, everyone everywhere should hear about how repenting and being forgiven for our mistakes can totally happen in Jesus' name, starting from Jerusalem and spreading to all nations."
Luke,24,48,"And you guys totally saw all of this go down, no cap."
Luke,24,49,"Yo, listen up! Get ready for some serious divine power vibes coming your way, straight from my Father! But here's the deal: chillax in the city of Jerusalem until you level up with epic power from the highest heavens. Easy peasy, fam!"
Luke,24,50,"Then he took them to Bethany, and he raised his hands and blessed them."
Luke,24,51,"So, like, while He was given blessings to his homies, He totally dipped and ascended into heaven."
Luke,24,52,"And they were totally stoked, praising and giving mad props to him, and then they jetted back to Jerusalem with major hype and pure bliss:"
Luke,24,53,"And they were always in the temple, giving mad props and blessings to God. Amen."
John,1,1,"So like, when everything first started, there was the Word. And the Word was with God, and the Word was actually God!"
John,1,2,"He's been there with God from the very start, you know."
John,1,3,"He totally created everything; like, seriously, nothing was made without him making it."
John,1,4,"He was full of life, and that life brought light to everyone."
John,1,5,"So, like, the light was shining in the darkness, but the darkness totally didn't get it. Like, didn't even try to understand or accept it or anything, you know?"
John,1,6,"So, like, there was this dude straight up sent by God, and his name was John, you know?"
John,1,7,"Yo, this person showed up to be a witness and testify about the Light, so that everyone could believe because of him."
John,1,8,"He wasn't like, the main light or anything, but like he was totally sent to like, testify about that insane light."
John,1,9,"Yo, that was the legit Light, shining on everyone who enters this world."
John,1,10,"So, like, he was totally in the world, right? And, get this, the world was, like, totally created by him, but the world didn't even recognize him, you know?"
John,1,11,"He came to his fam, but they didn't vibe with him."
John,1,12,"But all those who accepted him, he empowered them to become children of God, to those who trusted in his name. Powerr here means authority or privilege)"
John,1,13,"They were born, not because of their lineage, or the desires of their physical bodies, or human desires, but because of God."
John,1,14,"And the Word became a human and hung out with us (and we saw how awesome he was, like the one and only child of the Dad), super cool and authentic."
John,1,15,"John totally vouched for him, and was like, yo listen up, this is the dude I was talking about. The one who comes after me is actually way more lit than me, 'cause he existed before me."
John,1,16,"And we've all been blessed with everything from his overflow, receiving grace on top of grace."
John,1,17,"Yo, the rules were dropped by Moses, but Jesus Christ came through with that grace and truth vibe."
John,1,18,"No cap, nobody has ever clapped eyes on God; the one and only Son, chillin' in the Father's crib, is the real deal who brought the scoop on him."
John,1,19,"So, here's the tea about John. The Jews were all up in his DMs, sending priests and Levites from Jerusalem to slide into his inbox and ask him, 'Bruh, who do you think you are?'"
John,1,20,"And he straight up admitted it, no cap; he didn't try to hide it, but straight up said, 'I ain't the Christ'."
John,1,21,"They were like, 'So, are you Elias?' And he's like, 'Nah, not me.' Then they're like, 'Are you that prophet?' And he's like, 'Nah, not that either.'"
John,1,22,"They asked him, 'Who are you? So we can tell those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?'"
John,1,23,"Yo, I'm out here yellin' in the middle of nowhere, telling y'all to prepare the way for the Lord, just like that prophet dude Isaiah said."
John,1,24,"And the peeps who got sent were, like, Pharisees or something."
John,1,25,"And they were like, yo, they asked him this, like, 'Why you baptizing people if you not the Christ, or Elias, or that prophet? Like, what's up with that?'"
John,1,26,"Yo, John here. Just to clarify, I'm all about that water baptism. But, check it, there's someone hangin' with y'all that you totally don't recognize."
John,1,27,"He's the one who's gonna blow up after me, like way more famous than me. I don't even deserve to touch his sneakers, like not even worthy enough to untie the laces."
John,1,28,"These awesome things went down in Bethabara, like way out in Jordan, where John was doing his baptism thing."
John,1,29,"The next day, John sees Jesus approaching him and says, 'Check it out, here comes the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the whole world.'"
John,1,30,"Yo, remember when I told y'all about this dude who's gonna come after me but is actually way cooler than me? Yeah, turns out he existed even before I did. Can't deny the facts!"
John,1,31,"And I didn't really know him at first, but I'm here to show him to the people of Israel, which is why I'm doing this water dunking thing."
John,1,32,"So, John saw this epic moment and was like, yo, I witnessed the Spirit straight-up coming down from heaven, looking all peaceful like a dove, and just chilling on Jesus."
John,1,33,"And yo, I was clueless, didn't even recognize him. But the dude who sent me to splash people with water, he straight up told me that when I see the Spirit coming down and chilling on someone, that's the one who's all about baptizing with the Holy Ghost."
John,1,34,"Yo, I was peepin' and I gotta say, this dude right here? He's totally the Son of God, no cap."
John,1,35,"The next day, John was just chilling, and two of his homies rolled up;"
John,1,36,"Yo, check out Jesus strolling by, he's the legit Lamb of God!"
John,1,37,"And the two disciples were totally vibing with what he was saying, so they started rollin' with Jesus."
John,1,38,"So Jesus looked back and noticed them tagging along. He asked them, 'What's up? What are you looking for?' They replied to him, 'Yo, Rabbi! (That means 'Master' for all you cool kids.) Where you chilling at these days?' {dwellest: or, abidest}"
John,1,39,"He's like, 'Yo, come check this out.' So they went and saw where he was chilling, and they hung with him for the whole day, it was like around 10pm. (That's like two hours before night, FYI.)"
John,1,40,"One of the two dudes who heard John talking and started hanging with him was Andrew, Simon Peter's bro."
John,1,41,"He looks for his bro Simon and says, 'Yo, guess what? We found the Messias. That's like, the Christ, you know? But like, the Anointed too.'"
John,1,42,"So he takes him to Jesus. And when Jesus sees him, he says, 'You're Simon, son of Jona. But from now on, you're gonna be called Cephas, which means 'A stone'."
John,1,43,"The next day, Jesus was like, 'Yo, let's head to Galilee!' And he comes across Philip and straight up says, 'Dude, come follow me!'"
John,1,44,"So like, Philip was from Bethsaida, which is where Andrew and Peter came from."
John,1,45,"Philip saw Nathanael and was like, 'Dude, we totally found the guy Moses and the prophets talked about in the law—Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph's son!'"
John,1,46,"So, Nathanael was like, 'Can anything great even come out of Nazareth?' And Philip was like, 'Dude, just come and see for yourself.'"
John,1,47,"When Jesus spotted Nathanael approaching, he was like, 'Yo, check out this legit Israelite, no cap, dude's totally real!'"
John,1,48,"Nathanael's like, yo, how do you know me? Jesus be like, don't trip, bro. I saw you chilling under that fig tree even before Philip hit you up."
John,1,49,"Nathanael replied and said to him, Yo, Rabbi, you're like the ultimate Son of God, the real deal King of Israel."
John,1,50,"Jesus replied and said to him, 'Just because I told you that I saw you hanging out under the fig tree, do you actually believe that? Get ready to witness even more mind-blowing stuff!'"
John,1,51,"And he's like, seriously, listen up, I'm telling you, in the future, you'll witness heaven straight up opening, and angels going up and down on the Son of man."
John,2,1,"So like, on the third day, there was this dope wedding happening in Cana of Galilee, and guess what? Jesus' mom was totally there too!"
John,2,2,So Jesus and his squad were invited to the lit wedding!
John,2,3,"So, like, they're all out of wine, right? And Jesus' mom is just like, 'Hey, Jesus, they're totally out of wine!'"
John,2,4,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, why you trippin', woman? It ain't my time yet.'"
John,2,5,"His mom told the squad, whatever he tells you to do, just do it."
John,2,6,"There were like six stone water containers there, the kind the Jews used for purifying, holding like two or three big jugs each."
John,2,7,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, fill up those waterpots with water, fam.' And they filled them up all the way to the top."
John,2,8,"And he's like, yo guys, bring it over to the party boss. So they brought it, no cap."
John,2,9,"When the party boss took a sip of the water-turned-wine and didn't know where it came from (but the crew who poured the water did), the party manager called the groom."
John,2,10,"And he's like, bro, usually everyone starts with the good stuff, you know, top-tier wine. But once people are already pretty wasted, they bring out the cheap stuff. But you, man, you saved the best for last. That's lit!"
John,2,11,"Yo, this was when Jesus first started showing mad miracles in Cana of Galilee, straight up revealing His power and His disciples became true believers."
John,2,12,"Then, like, he went to Capernaum with his fam and squad, including his mom, siblings, and followers. They chilled there for a bit, but didn't stay long, you know?"
John,2,13,"So it was almost time for the Jewish peeps' Passover, and Jesus rolled up to Jerusalem like a boss,"
John,2,14,"So, Jesus goes into the temple and sees these people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and others exchanging money while lounging around:"
John,2,15,"Then he grabbed some cords and made a whip out of them. He straight-up kicked everyone, including the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple. He flipped the tables and straight-up dumped out all the money from the money changers."
John,2,16,"And he told the people selling doves, 'Move these things out of here; don't turn my Father's house into a retail store.'"
John,2,17,"And Jesus' squad was like, yo, don't forget it was written, I'm all about that holy life and it's totally consuming me."
John,2,18,"The Jews were like, 'Yo, what's your deal, man? Can you show us some proof for all the stuff you're doing?'"
John,2,19,"Jesus straight up replied to them, yo, wreck this temple, and I'll straight up rebuild it in just three days."
John,2,20,"So, like, the Jews were all, dude, this temple took forty-six whole years to build, and now you're saying you'll reconstruct it in just three days? Seriously?"
John,2,21,"But he was talking about his body, like, the temple."
John,2,22,"So, like, when Jesus came back to life, his squad totally remembered that he had already told them this. They trusted what was written in Scripture and everything that Jesus had said."
John,2,23,"So like, when he was chilling in Jerusalem during passover, at this big feast day, a lot of people started vibing with him and believing in his name, once they saw all the lit miracles he was pulling off."
John,2,24,"But Jesus wasn't about to trust them, 'cause he knew all about their true intentions, you know?"
John,2,25,"And he didn't need anyone to vouch for him, 'cause he totally knew what people were made of."
John,3,1,"So there was this Pharisee dude named Nicodemus, he was like a big shot ruler among the Jewish peeps:"
John,3,2,"So this guy came up to Jesus at night and was like, 'Hey, Rabbi, we know you’re legit. You must be a teacher sent by God cause nobody can pull off these mind-blowing miracles unless God’s got their back.'"
John,3,3,"Jesus was like, 'Listen up, dude, I'm 100% serious when I tell you this: if you don't go through a total transformation and start fresh, you won't even get a glimpse of God's kingdom.'"
John,3,4,"Nicodemus is like, yo Jesus, how can a dude get born again once he's old and stuff? Can he like, hop back into his mom's womb and pop out again?"
John,3,5,"Yo, Jesus said, like, seriously, I'm telling you, unless you're born both physically, like water birth style, and spiritually, you can't even enter God's kingdom. No joke, it's the real deal."
John,3,6,"Like, when you're born into this world, yeah, you become all about human stuff and earthly desires, but when you're reborn spiritually, it's all about that spiritual vibe, you know?"
John,3,7,"Don't freak out when I tell you, you gotta go through a rebirth. {again: or, from above}"
John,3,8,"The wind goes wherever it wants, and you hear the sound it makes, but you can't really figure out where it's coming from or where it's going. That's how it is with everyone who's born from the Spirit."
John,3,9,"Nicodemus was like, 'Wait, how is any of this even possible?'"
John,3,10,"Jesus was like, seriously? Are you, like, supposed to be this knowledgeable leader in Israel, and you don't even know this stuff?"
John,3,11,"For real, I'm telling you straight up, we're talking about what we really know and giving our firsthand account, but you're not accepting our testimony."
John,3,12,"Like, if I spill some basic facts that happen right here on Earth and you still don't vibe with it, how are you gonna grasp the bigger cosmic stuff if I drop that knowledge on you?"
John,3,13,"No one has ever like, gone up to heaven, except the dude who came down from heaven, you know, the Son of man who's chilling up there in heaven."
John,3,14,"And like, remember how Moses was like, holding up that snake in the desert? Well, in the same way, the Son of man has to be, you know, raised up too:"
John,3,15,"So, like, anyone who, like, totally believes in him won't, like, die or anything, but will have, like, eternal life, you know?"
John,3,16,"God loved the world so much, that he sent his one and only Son, so that those who trust in him will not be destroyed, but will have never-ending life."
John,3,17,"God didn't send his Son to trash the world, but to save it through him."
John,3,18,"If you trust him, you won't get judged. But if you don't trust him, you're already in a tough spot because you haven't trusted in the name of God's one and only Son."
John,3,19,"And like, here's the deal, the problem is that, back in the day, light like totally entered the scene, you know? But peeps were all about the darkness, coz, like, their actions were just straight-up wicked, bro."
John,3,20,"Anyone who does wrong hates the truth and avoids it, because they don't want their actions to be exposed. {exposed: or, revealed}"
John,3,21,"But whoever stays true and authentic embraces transparency, so that their actions may be revealed as those aligned with God's guidance."
John,3,22,"So, Jesus and his squad rolled into Judaea, and decided to chill there for a while, and you know what? He got into the whole baptism thing too."
John,3,23,"So John was doing some baptizing over at Aenon, close to Salim, because there was a ton of water there. People showed up and got baptized, too."
John,3,24,But John hadn't gotten locked up yet.
John,3,25,So there was this argument that went down between a few of John's crew and the Jews about the whole purification thing.
John,3,26,"So they went up to John and said, 'Hey, Rabbi! That dude you were talking about, the one you were vouching for? Well, guess what? He's over at the other side of the river Jordan, baptizing people left and right, and everyone is flocking to him.'"
John,3,27,"John was like, yo, peep this: you can't get anything, unless it's given to you from heaven."
John,3,28,"Y'all can totally vouch for me when I straight up said, I ain't the Messiah, but I'm just here to pave the way for him."
John,3,29,"The guy who has the girl as his partner is the groom, but the buddy of the groom, who's standing and listening to him, is super stoked because of the groom's voice. So, that's when I feel complete happiness."
John,3,30,"He gotta level up, but I gotta chill."
John,3,31,"The person who comes from above is on a whole other level: the one who comes from the earth is all about earthly things and talks about earthly stuff; but the one who comes from heaven, they're above everyone and everything."
John,3,32,"And yo, whatever he saw and heard, he straight up testifyin'. But man, ain't nobody takin' his word for it."
John,3,33,"If you're vibing with His testimony, then you're straight-up confirming that God is legit."
John,3,34,The person God sent speaks exactly what God says. God doesn't hold back when giving him the Spirit.
John,3,35,"The Dad totally adores the Son, and has handed over everything to him like, all of it!"
John,3,36,"Anyone who puts their faith in the Son will have a life that never ends: but those who don't believe in the Son won't experience life; instead, God's anger will stay on them."
John,4,1,"So, like, when the Lord found out that the Pharisees heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John,"
John,4,2,"(Even though Jesus didn't do the baptizing, but his squad did,)"
John,4,3,He bounced out of Judaea and jetted back to Galilee.
John,4,4,"So, like, he had to go through Samaria, you know?"
John,4,5,"So, he arrives at this city in Samaria, you know, called Sychar, which is like right next to the land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
John,4,6,"So like, Jacob had this well, right? And guess what, Jesus was there too, after a long journey and feeling tired AF. So he sat down by the well, and just FYI, it was like around 6 PM."
John,4,7,"This woman from Samaria comes to get water, and Jesus is like, 'Yo, can you hook me up with a drink?'"
John,4,8,(Because his squad had dipped to the city to cop some grub.)
John,4,9,"So, the woman from Samaria is like, 'Wait, why are you, a Jew, asking me for a drink? Like, we're Samaritans and you guys don't really interact with us.'"
John,4,10,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, if you knew what God has in store for you and who I am, asking you for a sip, you would've straight up asked me back and I would've hooked you up with some next-level refreshing vibes."
John,4,11,"The woman's like, 'Yo, dude, you don't even have anything to draw water with, and this well is like super deep. So, where do you even get this living water from?'"
John,4,12,"Are you seriously trying to flex on our OG, Jacob? He's the one who hooked us up with this lit well, you know? Like, he drank from it, his kids drank from it, even his animals got in on that hydration action. So, who do you think you are, trying to act all superior and stuff?"
John,4,13,"Jesus replied to her, 'Anyone who takes a sip of this water will get thirsty all over again:'"
John,4,14,"But whoever sips on the lit water I hook them up with won't ever feel parched again; in fact, it'll be like a dope well of water inside them, refreshing them with endless life."
John,4,15,"The lady's like, 'Yo, can you hook me up with that water, so I don't have to keep coming here to get it? I'm thirsty AF.'"
John,4,16,"Jesus is like, 'Hey, go hit up your husband and bring him over here.'"
John,4,17,"The woman was like, 'I don't have a husband.' Jesus was like, 'True that, you're speaking the truth, you don't have a husband.'"
John,4,18,"So, you've had like five husbands in the past, and the guy you're with now isn't officially your hubby, if you know what I mean. You're keeping it real, sis."
John,4,19,"Yo, she's like, 'Dude, I can tell you're totally a prophet.'"
John,4,20,"Bruh, our ancestors used to do their worship here on this lit mountain, but y'all out here claiming that worshiping in Jerusalem is the only way to go."
John,4,21,"Jesus is like, yo woman, trust me, there's gonna be a time when you won't need to go to any specific place, not even Jerusalem or this mountain, to worship the Father."
John,4,22,"Bruh, y'all be worshipin' without havin' a clue, but we stay woke on our worship game. 'Cause, yo, salvation is all thanks to the Jews, fam."
John,4,23,"Yo, listen up! The moment is near, like right now, when the real ones gonna worship the Father with heart and honesty. 'Cause that's what the Father's looking for, people who are all about that worship game."
John,4,24,"God is like, totally a spiritual being: and yo, if you wanna worship Him, you gotta do it with a legit, authentic spirit and be all about that truth."
John,4,25,"The woman is like, 'Yo, I know the Messias is gonna come, he's the one called Christ. When he shows up, he's gonna spill all the tea.'"
John,4,26,"Jesus is like, 'Yo, it's me, the one talking to you.'"
John,4,27,"So, like, his disciples showed up and were totally amazed that he was like, talking to this woman, you know? But, none of them were brave enough to be like, 'Hey, what are you looking for?' or 'Why are you talking to her?'"
John,4,28,"Then the woman was like, 'Bye, water bottle!' and went into the city and was like, 'Hey, guys! Guess what?'"
John,4,29,"Yo, come check out this dude who straight up knew everything I've ever done. Like, isn't he the Messiah or what?"
John,4,30,So they dipped from the city and rolled up on Him.
John,4,31,"Meanwhile, his disciples were like, 'Yo, Teacher, get some grub.'"
John,4,32,"But he was like, 'Guys, I've got some lit food that you're clueless about.'"
John,4,33,"So the disciples were like, 'Yo, did anyone bring him some food to eat?'"
John,4,34,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, listen up! Doing what God wants is my ultimate vibe, and completing His work is what fuels me."
John,4,35,"Yo, don't be like, 'Oh there's still like four months left till harvest time, no need to worry.' Listen up, I'm telling you, open your eyes and check out the fields, 'cause they're like totally ready for harvest right now."
John,4,36,"And the one who reaps gets paid and collects fruit that leads to everlasting life, so that both the one who plants and the one who harvests can celebrate together."
John,4,37,"And this is what's up, fam: One person puts in the work, and someone else reaps the benefits."
John,4,38,"I hooked you up with the fruits of someone else's hustle: they put in the work, and now you're reaping the benefits without lifting a finger."
John,4,39,"And a lot of the Samaritans in that city started to believe in him because of what the woman said. She was all like, 'He totally knows everything I've ever done!'"
John,4,40,"So when the Samaritans pulled up to him, they were like, 'Hey, can you chill with us?' And he was down, so he stayed there for two days."
John,4,41,And lots of other people believed because of what he said;
John,4,42,"And he said to the woman, Now we totally vibe with you, not just because of what you said: we've actually heard {him} ourselves, and we legit know that this is for real the Christ, the ultimate Savior of the world."
John,4,43,"So, like, two days later, he left from there and went to Galilee."
John,4,44,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, I'm telling you guys, prophets ain't respected in their own hometown.'"
John,4,45,"So, like, when he arrived in Galilee, the Galilaeans totally welcomed him 'cause they witnessed all the crazy stuff he pulled off in Jerusalem during the feast. 'Cause, ya know, they went to the feast too."
John,4,46,"So Jesus went back to Cana of Galilee, where he turned water into wine. And there was this dude, who was pretty important, and his son was sick in Capernaum."
John,4,47,"When he found out that Jesus came from Judaea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come and cure his son because he was seriously ill."
John,4,48,"Jesus was like, 'Bro, unless you see some insane signs and miracles, you won't even believe in me.'"
John,4,49,"The rich dude's like, 'Yo, come down quick before my kid croaks.'"
John,4,50,"Jesus was like, 'Dude, go home, your son is totally alive.' And the guy was all, like, 'I trust you, man.' So he bounced."
John,4,51,"And as he was heading down, his squad ran into him and said, 'Yo, your son is alive!'"
John,4,52,"So he asked them when he started feeling better. And they told him, it was yesterday at around 7 o'clock when the fever finally left him."
John,4,53,"So the dad realized that at the exact moment Jesus told him, 'Your son is alive.' And he totally believed Jesus, and his whole family believed too."
John,4,54,"Yo, check it out, this was the second dope miracle Jesus pulled off after he bounced from Judaea and rolled into Galilee."
John,5,1,"So, there was this lit fest of the Jews and Jesus decided to flex and head to Jerusalem."
John,5,2,"So, in Jerusalem near the sheep hangout spot, there's this cool pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It's got five porches, FYI. (BTW, the word 'market' can also mean 'gate', just a fun fact!)"
John,5,3,"There were a whole bunch of people who couldn't walk, blind, unable to move properly, and struggling, just chilling there, hoping for the water to start stirring."
John,5,4,"So there was this angel who came down to the pool at a specific time and stirred up the water. And then, whoever was quick enough to jump in right after the water got stirred up would be completely healed from any sickness they had."
John,5,5,"So, there was this dude chilling there, who's been dealing with a health issue for a whole thirty-eight years."
John,5,6,"When Jesus peeped that he was down and knew that he had been in that situation for a hot minute, he straight up asked him, 'You wanna be healed or what?'"
John,5,7,"Yo, bro, this dude who couldn't walk straight up told him, 'Yo, man, I don't got anyone to help me into the pool when the water gets all stirred up. Every time I try to make my way there, someone else beats me to it.'"
John,5,8,"Yo, Jesus is like, 'Hey dude, get up, grab your mattress, and start walking.'"
John,5,9,"And, like, right away the guy was totally healed, and he picked up his bed and walked, no joke. And by the way, it was the Sabbath day and everything."
John,5,10,"The Jews were like, 'Hey, dude who got healed, you can't be carrying your bed on the Sabbath. Not cool, bro.'"
John,5,11,"He replied, the one who healed me, told me to grab my mattress and start walking."
John,5,12,"So like, they were all like, 'Yo, who's the dude that told you to pick up your bed and start walking?'"
John,5,13,"And the guy who got healed didn't even know who did it, 'cause Jesus dipped out real quick when there was a massive crowd around. Like, he vanished into thin air, ya know?"
John,5,14,"Later, Jesus finds him in the temple and says, 'Yo, check it out, you're healed! But like, chill with the sinning, or else something way worse can happen to you.'"
John,5,15,"The guy bounced, and spilled the tea to the squad that it was Jesus who straight up healed him."
John,5,16,"So the Jews started hating on Jesus and wanted to take him out, just because he did some cool stuff on the day of rest."
John,5,17,"But Jesus replied to them, yo, my pops be grindin' nonstop, and I'm just out here doin' my thing too."
John,5,18,"So, like, the Jews were super triggered and totally wanted to eliminate him because not only did he, like, totally disregard the whole Sabbath thing, but he also straight-up claimed that God was his Father, asserting that he's equal to God."
John,5,19,"Jesus replied and said to them, truly, truly, I'm telling y'all that the Son can't do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise."
John,5,20,"Because the Father totally loves the Son, and he reveals everything he does to him: and he's gonna show him even cooler stuff than this, so you all can be mind-blown."
John,5,21,"Just like how God brings people back to life and makes them alive again, the Son also brings people back to life as he chooses."
John,5,22,"lol, God the Father doesn't judge anyone, He lets His son handle it: like, Jesus is in charge of all the judging, you know?"
John,5,23,"Ya'll gotta show mad respect to the Son, just like you do to the Father. If you don't show respect to the Son, you ain't showing respect to the Father who sent him."
John,5,24,"For real though, I'm telling you, if you listen to what I'm saying and believe in the one who sent me, you'll have eternal life and won't be judged. You'll go from death to life, no doubt about it."
John,5,25,"Seriously, listen up! I'm telling you, the time is coming, and it's happening right now, when the people who have passed away will hear the voice of the Son of God: and those who listen will come back to life."
John,5,26,"Just like how the Father has life within him, He has given the Son the power to have life within himself too;"
John,5,27,"And like, He's totally given Him the power to bring down judgment and stuff, 'cause He's the Son of man and all."
John,5,28,Don't be shook by this: 'cause the time's approaching when all the homies in the graves will hear his voice.
John,5,29,"And like, they're gonna come out of their graves and stuff, those who've done good, they'll get a dope resurrection and enter into eternal life, while those who've done evil, they're gonna face a major resurrection but it's gonna be a total bummer 'cause it leads to eternal punishment."
John,5,30,"I can't do anything on my own, fam. I only do what I hear, and when I judge, it's all fair game. It's not about my own desires, but about doing the will of the Father who sent me."
John,5,31,"If I flex on myself, my flex ain't legit."
John,5,32,"There's someone else who's got my back, and I totally trust that what they say about me is legit."
John,5,33,"You hit up John and he straight up endorsed the truth, no cap."
John,5,34,"Yo, I ain't just relying on what people say to back me up. I'm telling you these things so that you can find salvation."
John,5,35,"He was like a lit AF beacon, shining bright and attracting major attention: and y'all were totally down to celebrate his glow for a hot minute."
John,5,36,"But I've got even more proof than John does: the stuff I've been doing, the tasks my Dad gave me, they totally back me up and show that my Dad sent me on this mission."
John,5,37,"And the Dad, like, the one who sent me, has totally vouched for me. You guys haven't even heard his voice or seen what he looks like, ever."
John,5,38,"And like, you don't even have his word staying with you, 'cause you straight up don't believe in the one he sent."
John,5,39,"Yo, like, check out the scriptures, fam! 'Cause, like, you think that's where you find eternal life and stuff, and, yo, they're the ones that straight up testify about me."
John,5,40,"And you won't even come to me, like, seriously, I'm here to give you life, but you're just not interested, smh."
John,5,41,I don't seek validation from others.
John,5,42,"But I peeped you, fam, and I can tell you're lacking that divine love vibe."
John,5,43,"Yo, I'm rollin' up in my Father's name, but y'all ain't feelin' me: if some homie shows up touting his own name, you'll be all about him."
John,5,44,"Why can't you believe? You're all about seeking validation from each other, but you don't even care about the validation that comes from God alone!"
John,5,45,"Don't even think I'm gonna rat you out to the Big Guy upstairs – you've got Moses on your case, the guy you put all your faith in."
John,5,46,"If y'all actually believed Moses, then y'all would've believed me too, 'cause he straight up wrote about me, fam."
John,5,47,"But if you don't have faith in his writings, how are you gonna trust what I'm sayin'?"
John,6,1,"So, like, Jesus decided to take a trip across the sea of Galilee, you know, the one that's sometimes called the sea of Tiberias."
John,6,2,"A huge crowd was all over him, 'cause they peeped his sick miracles on the ones who were hella sick."
John,6,3,So Jesus hiked up this chill mountain and found a prime spot to chillax with his disciples.
John,6,4,"And the Passover, a lit feast for the Jews, was about to happen."
John,6,5,"When Jesus looked up and saw a big group of people coming towards him, he asked Philip, 'Where can we get bread to feed all these people?'"
John,6,6,"And he said this to test him out, 'cause he already knew what he was about to do."
John,6,7,"Philip was like, bro, even if we had 200 bucks worth of bread, that wouldn't be enough to give everyone just a small piece, ya know?"
John,6,8,"So, this dude, Andrew, who happens to be Simon Peter's bro, goes up to him and says,"
John,6,9,"Yo, there's this dude here with five barley loaves and two small fishes, but like, what's that gonna do for all these peeps?"
John,6,10,"And Jesus was like, yo guys, take a seat. By the way, there was mad grass around. So all the dudes sat down, like around five thousand of 'em."
John,6,11,"So Jesus grabbed the bread and, after saying thanks, handed it out to his crew, and they passed it on to everyone who was chilling there. They did the same thing with the fish, giving people as much as they wanted."
John,6,12,"After everyone had eaten their fill, he told his squad, like, grab all the leftover scraps so nothing goes to waste."
John,6,13,So they all came together and filled up twelve baskets with the leftover pieces from the five barley loaves that were left after everyone had eaten.
John,6,14,"Those dudes, after witnessing the sick miracle Jesus pulled off, were like, yo this is the real deal, the prophet we've been waiting for, no cap."
John,6,15,"So, like, Jesus knew that these people were about to come and try to grab him and make him their king, but he was like, 'Nah, not my vibe.' So he went up on a mountain by himself, chilling solo."
John,6,16,"And when it was evening, his squad rolled down to the ocean,"
John,6,17,"So they hopped on a boat and sailed across the sea to Capernaum. It was getting late, and Jesus hadn't shown up yet."
John,6,18,Then the ocean got all wild and crazy 'cause of this major windstorm.
John,6,19,"So, like, when they had rowed for, like, 25 or 30 furlongs, they see Jesus just casually walking on the sea, getting closer to the ship and stuff, and they were totally freaking out, man."
John,6,20,"But he's like, 'Yo, it's me! Don't freak out or anything.'"
John,6,21,"They were totally down to let him on the ship: and right away, the ship reached the exact place they were heading to."
John,6,22,"The next day, when the peeps on the other side of the sea peeped that there weren't any other boats there, except the one with Jesus' squad in it, and Jesus didn't roll with them in the boat, but his squad dipped without him;"
John,6,23,"But like, there were other boats from Tiberias that showed up near the spot where they were chowing down, right after the Lord said his thanks, you know?"
John,6,24,"So, when the people saw that Jesus and his disciples were no longer there, they hopped on a ship and headed to Capernaum, on a mission to find Jesus."
John,6,25,"So, like, they tracked him down on the opposite shore, and they were all like, 'Yo, Rabbi, when did you get here?'"
John,6,26,"Jesus was like, 'Hey, listen up! I gotta tell you something real important. You only look for me because you want free food, not because you saw the cool miracles I did before."
John,6,27,"Don't hustle just for temporary gains, but focus on the real deal that lasts forever - the eternal life that the Son of Man will hook you up with. God the Father has totally co-signed Him, so you know it's legit. {Don't hustle: or, Don't work your butt off}"
John,6,28,"They were like, 'Yo, what do we gotta do to do some dope works for God?'"
John,6,29,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Listen up, fam. The real deal is this: God's work is all about believing in the one he sent.'"
John,6,30,"So, like, they straight up asked Him, 'Yo, what kind of epic miracle are you gonna perform for us? Something that'll make us believe in you?'"
John,6,31,"Our ancestors had this lit experience in the desert, fam; like it's written, God hooked them up with heaven-sent bread to munch on."
John,6,32,"Yo, Jesus straight up telling ya'll like, for real, Moses ain't the one who hooked y'all up with that heavenly bread. It's my pops who's giving ya the real deal, bread from heaven."
John,6,33,"The real deal from God is like the sickest vibe ever, coming straight from heaven, and giving life to the whole world."
John,6,34,"They were like, 'Yo, dude, always hook us up with that bread.'"
John,6,35,"Jesus was like, yo listen up, I'm the ultimate sustenance for your soul: anyone who chills with me won't ever feel empty, and whoever puts their trust in me won't ever feel thirsty."
John,6,36,"But, like, guys, I straight up told you that you've actually seen me with your own eyes, yet you still ain't believing it. Smh."
John,6,37,"All the people who are sent to me by God will definitely come to me, and anyone who comes to me, I will never reject them."
John,6,38,"Cuz I came straight from heaven, not to do my own thing but to do what the one who sent me wants."
John,6,39,"And this is what the Dad wants, the one who sent me, that out of everyone given to me, I shouldn't let anything slip away, but instead, bring it back to life on the final day."
John,6,40,"And like, here's what the dude who sent me wants: anyone who sees the Son and believes in him gets to live forever, you know? And I'll totally bring them back on the final day, no doubt."
John,6,41,"The Jews were like, totally whining about him, 'cause he straight up said, 'Bro, I'm the bread that came down from heaven.'"
John,6,42,"So, like, they were all like, 'Isn't this Jesus, Joseph's kid? We totally know his parents, right? So how is he saying he came from heaven?'"
John,6,43,"Yo, Jesus heard y'all talking and he's like, 'Chill, don't be gossiping.'"
John,6,44,"No cap, no one can roll up to me unless the OG who sent me pulls them in. And on the real, I got their back on the ultimate day."
John,6,45,"This is what the prophets said: God will teach everyone. So, anyone who listens and learns from the Father will come to me."
John,6,46,"No one has actually seen God, except the ones who are from God; they've caught a glimpse of Him."
John,6,47,"Yo, listen up fam, I'm telling you straight up, anyone who believes in me gets to live forever."
John,6,48,"I'm like the ultimate source of energy, like the bread that keeps you going."
John,6,49,"Your parents had this epic thing called manna during their wilderness days, but, like, they're totally deceased now."
John,6,50,"Yo fam, this bread is straight from heaven. When you eat it, you won't die, bro."
John,6,51,"Bruh, I'm like the lit bread that came straight from heaven, you know? If anyone chows down on this bread, they're gonna live forever, no cap. And the bread I'm about to serve up is actually my own flesh, sacrificed to save the world."
John,6,52,"The Jews were totally arguing, like, 'Um, how can this dude expect us to, like, eat his flesh?'"
John,6,53,"Yo, listen up! Jesus straight up said, like for real for real, unless you eat his flesh and drink his blood, you won't have any life in you."
John,6,54,"Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will have eternal life, and I'll totally bring them back on the final day, no cap."
John,6,55,"Yo, my body is legit food and my blood is like actual drink."
John,6,56,"If you vibe with me and embrace my essence, we're like permanent roommates, mutually chillin'."
John,6,57,"Just like how the cool Father sent me and I totally vibe with him, whoever munches on me will vibe with me and have a dope life too."
John,6,58,"Yo, this is the real deal bread that legit came straight from heaven: It ain't like how your oldies used to munch on manna and peaced out; but everyone who chows down on this bread will straight up live forever."
John,6,59,He said these things while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
John,6,60,"So like, a bunch of Jesus' followers, when they heard this, they were like, 'Dude, this is super difficult to understand! Like, who can even handle it?'"
John,6,61,"When Jesus realized that his disciples were lowkey throwing shade, he straight up asked them, 'Does this situation make you mad uncomfortable?'"
John,6,62,"What if you, like, witness the Son of man going back to where He was before?"
John,6,63,"The real deal that gives life is the spirit, the physical stuff doesn't do squat. The words I'm dropping on you? They're straight-up spirit and pure life."
John,6,64,"But like, there are some of you who don't believe, you know? Jesus, like, totally knew right from the get-go who those people were, the ones who didn't believe and would end up betraying him."
John,6,65,"So basically, lemme break it down for ya. I'm telling you, no one, like seriously no one, can come to me unless my Dad says so. Straight up."
John,6,66,"After that, a bunch of his followers dipped out and decided he wasn't their vibe anymore."
John,6,67,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, twelve homies, y'all gonna ditch me too?'"
John,6,68,"Yo, Peter straight up responded, Jesuss, like, who else should we bounce to? You straight up speak truth that leads to everlasting life, man.'"
John,6,69,"And like, we totally believe and are like 100% sure that you're the real deal, Jesus, the Son of the awesome living God."
John,6,70,"Jesus was like, yo, I picked all y'all as homies, but real talk, one of you is straight-up wicked."
John,6,71,"He was talking about Judas Iscariot, you know, Simon's kid. Yeah, that's the guy who was gonna betray him, even though he was part of the crew of twelve."
John,7,1,"So, like, Jesus was chilling in Galilee 'cause he didn't wanna go to Jewry. The Jews were totally out to get him, man."
John,7,2,"So, like, the Jews were about to celebrate this cool festival called the feast of tabernacles."
John,7,3,"So like his friends were all like, 'Yo, dude, you should totally leave this place and go to Judaea so that your followers can witness all the amazing stuff you're doing, you know?!"
John,7,4,"No one hides anymore. Everyone wants to be seen and recognized. If you're really about it, show yourself to the world."
John,7,5,"Yo, even his own squad didn't believe in him."
John,7,6,"And Jesus was like, 'Yo, it ain't my time yet, but y'all always ready to go.'"
John,7,7,"The world can't hate on you, but it's definitely hating on me because I'm exposing its wicked ways."
John,7,8,"Yo, let's hit up this feast: I ain't rollin' up there just yet, my time ain't fully poppin' yet."
John,7,9,"After speaking these words to them, he stayed in Galilee for a while."
John,7,10,"But when his siblings left, he also went up to the big event, not making a big show, but rather low-key."
John,7,11,"So the Jews were looking for him during the feast, and they were all like, 'Where is he?'"
John,7,12,"There was like a lot of gossip going around about him, you know? Some people were all like, 'Yeah, he's a total legend!' But then there were others who were like, 'Nuh uh, he's just playing everybody.'"
John,7,13,But nobody really talked about him openly because they were afraid of the Jews.
John,7,14,"So, like, in the middle of the feast, Jesus straight up went to the temple and dropped some knowledge on everyone."
John,7,15,"And the Jews were shook, like, how does this dude know so much without learning it?"
John,7,16,"Jesus like totally responded, and was like, yo, what I'm preaching isn't even my own idea, but it's from the one who sent me."
John,7,17,"If anyone is down to do what he wants, he'll get what's up with the teachings, whether they come from God or if I'm just speaking for myself."
John,7,18,"Someone who only talks about themselves is just trying to make themselves look good. But someone who speaks about the one who sent them, they are being authentic and there's no unfairness in them."
John,7,19,"Yo, didn't Moses lay down the law for y'all, but none of you even follow it? Why you out here trying to end my life?"
John,7,20,"The people were like, 'Dude, you're possessed! Who's trying to off you?'"
John,7,21,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, listen up! I just did this one epic thing, and EVERYONE was blown away.'"
John,7,22,"So Moses gave you the tradition of circumcision (not because he made it up, but because it comes from our ancestors). And even on the Sabbath, you guys follow through with circumcising a man."
John,7,23,"If a dude gets circumcised on the Sabbath just to follow Moses' law and not break it, why are you hating on me for making a guy completely healed on the Sabbath? Like, seriously?"
John,7,24,"Don't judge based on looks, but make fair judgments that are righteously sound."
John,7,25,"So, like, some people from Jerusalem were all like, 'Yo, isn't this the dude they're trying to take out?'"
John,7,26,"Yo, this dude's straight up speaking his mind and nobody's saying a word. Are the big shots even aware that this is the real deal, the Messiah?"
John,7,27,"But we're familiar with this dude's background, but when Christ comes, nobody knows where he's from."
John,7,28,"So Jesus started shouting in the temple while teaching, like fam, you all know me and where I'm from. I ain't just here on my own, the one who sent me is legit, but y'all don't even know him."
John,7,29,"But I totally know him, 'cause I'm, like, literally from him, and he's totally sent me."
John,7,30,"So, like, they wanted to grab him, but no one actually did anything to him because the timing wasn't right yet, you know?"
John,7,31,"And a lot of people believed in him and were like, 'When the Messiah shows up, will he pull off even crazier miracles than this dude here?'"
John,7,32,"So, like, the Pharisees caught wind that people were talking some stuff about him, y'know? And then the Pharisees and the chief priests sent a squad to go and grab him."
John,7,33,"Jesus was like, 'Hey guys, just letting you know, I'll be here for a little longer and then I'm off to see the one who sent me.'"
John,7,34,"You'll be searching for me, but won't be able to find me. And where I am, you won't be able to go there, fam."
John,7,35,"So, the Jewish peeps were like, where's he gonna bounce to that we can't track him? Is he gonna head to the scattered peeps from other nations and teach 'em? {Greeks, I mean}"
John,7,36,"Yo, what's up with this whole thing he just said? He's like, 'You guys gonna be lookin' for me, but I won't be around, and you won't be able to join me wherever I'm at.'"
John,7,37,"On the ultimate day, during that lit feast, Jesus straight up stood and shouted, like, 'Yo, if you're thirsty AF, just come to me and take a sip, no cap.'"
John,7,38,"Yo, if you rock with me like the scripture says, you'll be flowing with mad positive vibes like a whole stream of living water coming out of your soul."
John,7,39,"(But like, He was talking about the Spirit, that those who believe in Him would receive, you know? The Holy Ghost hadn't been given yet, 'cause Jesus wasn't glorified at that time.)"
John,7,40,"So like, a lot of people heard this and were like, 'Yo, no cap, this gotta be the Prophet!'"
John,7,41,"Some people were like, 'Yo, this is the real deal, the Christ.' But others were like, 'Hold up, how can the Christ come from Galilee tho? Like, for real?'"
John,7,42,"Yo, did the scripture not say that Christ comes from David's bloodline, straight outta Bethlehem, where David himself was at?"
John,7,43,"So like, there was, like, a major split among the people 'cause of him."
John,7,44,"So like, there were some people who wanted to catch him, but they didn't actually grab him or anything."
John,7,45,"So, like, the officers went up to the big shots, the chief priests and Pharisees, and they were all like, 'Yo, why haven't you brought him here yet?'"
John,7,46,"The officers were like, yo, no one talks as rad as this guy."
John,7,47,"The Pharisees were like, 'Wait, are y'all also fooled?'"
John,7,48,Did any of the rulers or the Pharisees actually believe in him?
John,7,49,"But these people who don't even know the law, like, they're totally cursed."
John,7,50,"Nicodemus was like, 'Yo, dudes, it was me who went to see Jesus at night, and I'm one of you guys too, just sayin'."
John,7,51,"Like, does our law just like, judge someone without even like, listening to them and know what they've actually done?"
John,7,52,"They were like, 'Wait, are you like from Galilee too? Look it up for yourself, but like, no prophet ever comes from Galilee.'"
John,7,53,And all the dudes went to their own crib.
John,8,1,Jesus went to the chill spot at the mount of Olives.
John,8,2,"So, like, early in the morning, he went back to the temple and all the people came to him. Then he just sat down and started teaching them."
John,8,3,"So, like, there were these scribes and Pharisees who brought this woman to Jesus because she was caught in the act of adultery. And, get this, they put her right in the center of everyone."
John,8,4,"They were like, 'Yo, dude, check it out. This chick got caught in the act of cheating!'"
John,8,5,"Hey, according to the law that Moses gave us, people like this should be stoned. But what's your take on this?"
John,8,6,"They said this to test him and find a reason to accuse him. But Jesus leaned down and started doodling on the ground, seemingly ignoring their words."
John,8,7,"So, like, when they kept on asking him, he, you know, kind of raised himself up and was like, 'Listen up, y'all! If any of you peeps think you're, like, totally sinless, then go ahead and throw the first stone at her, I guess.'"
John,8,8,"Then he crouched down once more, and started scribbling on the ground."
John,8,9,"So, like, the people who heard that, realized deep down in their hearts that they messed up, and one by one they left, starting with the oldest people and going all the way to the youngest. In the end, Jesus was the only one left, along with the woman who was there."
John,8,10,"When Jesus looked up and saw only the woman, he said to her: 'Yo, girl, where your haters at? Ain't nobody judging you, right?'"
John,8,11,"She was like, 'Nah, dude, no way.' And Jesus was like, 'Yo, I don't judge you either. Just go, and stop doing wrong stuff, okay?'"
John,8,12,"So, like, Jesus spoke to them once more and was all like, 'Yo, listen up! I'm the litest light of the world. If you follow me, you won't be stranded in darkness but instead, you'll have the ultimate source of a lit life.'"
John,8,13,"The Pharisees were like, 'Uh, you're just talking about yourself, bro. Your 'evidence' ain't legit.'"
John,8,14,"Jesus replied to them and said, 'Even though I'm the one speaking for myself, what I say is true. I know where I came from and where I'm going, but you have no idea where I come from or where I'm headed.'"
John,8,15,You judge based on appearances; I don't judge anyone.
John,8,16,"But like, if I gotta make a call, trust me, it's legit: 'cause I ain't flying solo, me and the pops are in sync."
John,8,17,"Like, in your law it says that when two dudes testify, it's, like, totally legit."
John,8,18,"I can vouch for myself, and the big guy upstairs who sent me can vouch for me too."
John,8,19,"They asked him, like, where's your dad at? Jesus was, like, y'all don't even know me or my dad. If you really knew me, you would've known my dad too."
John,8,20,"Jesus dropped these words in the treasury while flexing at the temple, and nobody even tried to cancel him because it wasn't his time to go viral yet."
John,8,21,"And Jesus was like, yo guys, I'm outta here. Y'all gonna be searching for me, but you'll be stuck in your sins and you won't be able to follow where I'm headed."
John,8,22,"The Jews were like, is he gonna off himself? 'Cause he's saying, y'all can't come where he's going."
John,8,23,"And he was like, 'Yo, y'all be from down here, but I'm straight up from above. You belong to this world, but I ain't even part of it, fam.'"
John,8,24,"So, like, I'm telling you straight up, if you don't believe that I am who I am, you're gonna die with all your sins."
John,8,25,"They asked him, 'Who are you?' And Jesus replied, 'I'm the one I told you about right from the start.'"
John,8,26,"Yo, I got a lot to tell y'all and some judgments to make, but the one who sent me is legit, no cap. I'm just spitting the truth to the world, passing on what I heard from him."
John,8,27,They didn't get that he was talking about his dad.
John,8,28,"Jesus was like, 'Once you've lifted me up, you'll finally get that I'm the real deal and I'm not just doing my own thing. Everything I say comes straight from my Father's teachings.'"
John,8,29,And the one who sent me is totally vibing with me: the Father hasn't ditched me; I'm always doing the things that make him stoked.
John,8,30,"While he was talking, a lot of people started believing in him."
John,8,31,"So Jesus told those Jews who believed in him, if you stick with what I'm saying, then you're truly my followers."
John,8,32,"And you'll totally be woke, like, knowing the truth and stuff, and that truth will totally set you free."
John,8,33,"They replied, We're descendants of Abraham and we've never been slaves to anyone. So how can you say that we'll be set free?"
John,8,34,"Jesus was like, 'Listen up, guys! I'm totally serious when I say this. Anyone who does something wrong is basically a slave to doing wrong things.'"
John,8,35,"And the servant's not gonna stay in the crib forever, but the Son's gonna be here forever, no cap."
John,8,36,"So, like, if the Son sets you free, you'll be like, totally free. For real."
John,8,37,"I know you're from Abraham's fam, but you're tryna take me out 'cause my words don't jive with you."
John,8,38,"I'm just spitting facts straight from my old man, while y'all doing the same from your own pops."
John,8,39,"They replied, Abrahamm is our OG ancestor, dude.' Jesus told them, 'If y'all were truly Abraham's fam, you'd be living like him, doing righteous stuff and all.'"
John,8,40,"But like, seriously? You guys are actually trying to off me? I'm just a regular dude keeping it real and speaking the truth straight from God. Abraham never pulled off anything like this, man."
John,8,41,"You're doing the same things as your old man. They replied, 'We're not illegitimate babies; we have one Dad, ya know, God.'"
John,8,42,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, if God was really your homie, you would be totally down with me, because I came from Him and was sent by Him, not just doing my own thing."
John,8,43,"Bruh, why don't y'all get what I'm sayin'? It's 'cause y'all don't even listen to my words."
John,8,44,"You are like the devil, your true dad, and you will do whatever he wants. He's been a killer since forever and he can't handle the truth because he's all about lies. Every time he opens his mouth, it's just more lies, and he's the master of it."
John,8,45,"And, like, I'm totally keeping it real with you, but you're not even believing what I'm saying. Ugh, can't even."
John,8,46,"Yo, can any of y'all prove me guilty of doing something wrong? And if I'm straight up telling the truth, why don't you believe me?"
John,8,47,"If you really vibe with God, you're gonna be all ears for what He's saying. But, like, if you're not on that God level, then you won't be able to hear His words. No shade, it's just, you're not on His wavelength, ya know?"
John,8,48,"The Jews hit back and were like, 'Ain't it true that you're a Samaritan and possessed by a demon?'"
John,8,49,"Jesus replied, No way, dude, I definitely don't have a devil taking over me. I'm all about showing respect and love for my Dad, but you peeps, you're totally disrespecting me."
John,8,50,And I'm not all about flexing for myself: there's someone out there who's always watching and making judgments.
John,8,51,"Tbh, listen up fam, if you're all about my teachings, you won't ever have to deal with death. No cap."
John,8,52,"The Jews were like, 'Dude, you must be possessed or something. Abraham and all the prophets are history, and here you are claiming that if someone follows your words, they won't ever kick the bucket.'"
John,8,53,"Are you seriously tryna flex on our main man Abraham, who's totally deceased? Like, all the prophets before you, they're gone too. So, who do you even think you are?"
John,8,54,"Yo, Jesus straight up said, if I start flexing and hyping myself up, it ain't even worth nothing. It's all about my Dad, He's the one who gives me that legit honor. Y'all out here claiming that He's your God and all, but you don't even get that I'm connected to Him like that."
John,8,55,"But honestly, you guys don't really know him like I do. If I were to front like I don't know him, I'd be straight up lying, just like y'all. But truth is, I know him inside out and I'm stayin' true to his teachings."
John,8,56,Abraham's pops was stoked to witness my era: and he totally saw it and was mad hyped.
John,8,57,"The Jews were like, bro, you're not even fifty yet and you're claiming you saw Abraham? Like, how is that even possible?"
John,8,58,"Jesus straight up told them, I'm telling you the real deal, even before Abraham existed, I was already here."
John,8,59,"Then they were about to throw rocks at him, but Jesus played hide and seek, slipped out of the temple, walked through the crowd, and made his way out like a total ninja."
John,9,1,"And like, Jesus was just walkin' past, and he spotted this dude who had been blind since he was born."
John,9,2,"So, like, the disciples were all chill and asked Jesus, 'Yo, Master, who messed up here? Was it this dude's fault or his parents' fault that he was born blind?'"
John,9,3,"Jesus replied, this dude and his parents didn't do anything wrong, but rather, this whole situation happened so that everyone can see God's amazing work in action."
John,9,4,"Gotta grind and do the things the one who sent me assigned me to do, while there's still daylight. The night is coming, when no one can get stuff done."
John,9,5,"Yo, as long as I'm out here, I'm the ultimate source of light and positivity in this world, fam."
John,9,6,"After saying that, he like, spat on the ground, and like made clay with the spit, and then like put the clay on the blind man's eyes, you know?"
John,9,7,"And he said to him, like, 'Dude, go and wash in the pool of Siloam, which, by the way, means 'Sent'. So he did it, went and washed, and guess what? He totally regained his sight!"
John,9,8,"Yo, the neighbors and the peeps who had seen him blind before were like, 'Yo, isn't this the dude who used to sit and beg?'"
John,9,9,"So like, some people were all like, 'Yo, that's totally him!' and others were like, 'Nah, he just kinda looks like him.' But then he straight up said, 'Yup, it's me.'"
John,9,10,"So they were like, 'Yo, how did you get your eyes to see again?'"
John,9,11,"So like, this guy Jesus, legit made some clay, put it on my eyes, and was like, 'Bro, go to the pool of Siloam and wash up.' So I did it and BAM, I could see again!"
John,9,12,"They were like, yo, where is he at? And he was like, um, I have no clue, fam."
John,9,13,They took the dude who used to be blind to the Pharisees.
John,9,14,"It was like a chill Sunday, and Jesus was just vibin', makin' some clay and then bam! He opened the dude's eyes."
John,9,15,"So the Pharisees asked him again how he got his sight back. He replied, 'I put clay on my eyes, washed it off, and now I can see.'"
John,9,16,"So, like, some of the Pharisees were like, 'Yo, this dude ain't from God, man, 'cause he's not keeping the Sabbath, you know?'. But then, there were others who were like, 'Wait, how can a sinful dude be out here performing miracles, huh?'. And, well, that caused, like, a split among them, you know?"
John,9,17,"Yo, they were all like, 'Yo blind dude, what you think 'bout the homie who opened your eyes?' And he was like, 'He straight up a prophet, man.'"
John,9,18,"But yo, the Jews didn't even believe when they heard that this dude used to be blind but now he can see. They were straight up skeptical until they brought in his parents to confirm it."
John,9,19,"Yo, they be like askin' them, sayin', Is this your kid, the one y'all said was born blind? So how he suddenly got his vision back?"
John,9,20,"So, their parents were like, 'Yeah, we got you! That's our son. He was totally born blind, no cap:'"
John,9,21,"But we have no idea how he can see now or who made him see. He's old enough to speak for himself, so go ahead and ask him."
John,9,22,His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews. The Jews had already decided that anyone who said they were the Christ would be kicked out of the synagogue.
John,9,23,"So his parents were like, 'He's old enough, you should just ask him.'"
John,9,24,"They called the guy who was blind again and said to him, 'Give credit where it's due to God: we know this man is a bad dude.'"
John,9,25,"He was like, uhh, I can't really tell if the guy is a sinner or not, but here's what I do know - I used to be blind and now I can see, so yeah."
John,9,26,"They asked him again, like, 'What did that guy do to you? How did he make you able to see?'"
John,9,27,"He's like, guys, I already told you this, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also wanna be his followers or what?"
John,9,28,"They straight up dissed him, saying, 'You're just following him, but we're ride or die for Moses, fam.'"
John,9,29,"Like, we heard that God talked to Moses, but this guy, we have no idea where he's from."
John,9,30,"Dude, this is mind-blowing! You guys don't even know where this guy comes from, and yet he's totally changed my perspective."
John,9,31,"So, like, we all understand that God doesn't listen to people who do bad stuff. But if you're all about worshipping God and actually doing what He wants, then for sure He's gonna hear you."
John,9,32,"Yo, have you ever heard of anyone popping someone's blind-mode off since like, forever?"
John,9,33,"If this dude wasn't God's homie, he couldn't pull off anything."
John,9,34,"They were like, 'Uh, you were basically just born a sinner, so who are you to teach us?' And yeah, they totally kicked him out. #excommunicated"
John,9,35,"Jesus found out they kicked him out, and when he tracked him down, he was like, 'Yo, do you actually believe in the Son of God?'"
John,9,36,"He replied and said, Yo, who's this person, Lord? Like, tell me so I can start believing in him."
John,9,37,"And Jesus was like, 'Bro, you've actually seen Him, and He's the one who's chatting with you right now.'"
John,9,38,"He was like, 'Yo, I'm all in, Lord.' And then he showed mad respect, like straight up worshipped him."
John,9,39,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, I came into this world for judgment. The peeps who can't see will actually start seeing, and the ones who claim they can see will be blind af.'"
John,9,40,"Yo, some of the Pharisees who were chilling with him heard what he said and asked him, like, 'Are we also blind?'"
John,9,41,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, if you were blind, you wouldn't be held accountable for your mistakes. But since you claim to see everything, your wrongdoing still stands."
John,10,1,"Listen up, folks! Let me drop some truth on you: If someone doesn't come through the door into the sheep pen, but tries to sneak in some other way, they're nothing but a sneaky thief and a robber."
John,10,2,But the one who comes in through the door is like the ultimate goat wrangler.
John,10,3,"The bouncer lets him in; and the squad hears his voice: and he hits up his own squad by name, and takes them out."
John,10,4,"And when the shepherd leads his own squad, he goes ahead of them, and the squad follows him because they recognize his vibe."
John,10,5,"And they won't follow some random person, they'll run away instead, 'cause they don't recognize their voice."
John,10,6,"So Jesus told them this story, but they just didn't get what he was saying."
John,10,7,"So like, Jesus was all, like, 'Listen up fam, for real, I'm telling you, I'm the door for the squad.'"
John,10,8,"Like, everyone who came before me were just trying to steal and take advantage, but the true followers didn't even pay them any attention."
John,10,9,"Yo, I'm like the ultimate entrance, bro: if anyone steps through me, they'll be saved and free to come and go, living their best life and finding amazing opportunities, no cap."
John,10,10,"The thief isn't here for anything good, only to snatch, wreck, and obliterate. But I've arrived to give them an epic life, one that's overflowing with awesomeness."
John,10,11,"I'm like the ultimate shepherd, you know? The best one out there. I would totally give up my life for my favorite sheep. #loyalty"
John,10,12,"But the one who's just in it for the paycheck, and ain't the real deal, doesn't really care about the sheep. When danger comes lurking, they ditch the sheep and bolt, leaving them vulnerable to the wolf's attack, and the sheep end up scattered all over the place."
John,10,13,The hired worker bounces because they're just in it for the paycheck and couldn't care less about the sheep.
John,10,14,"Yo, I'm like the ultimate shepherd, you know? I totally vibe with my squad of cool {sheep}, and they totally vibe with me too."
John,10,15,"It's like, the Father totally understands me, and I totally understand the Father, ya know? And, no biggie, but I'm willing to sacrifice myself for the sheep, like, I got their backs."
John,10,16,"I have other squad members, not part of this crew. I gotta bring them too, and they'll get to hear my voice. We gonna be one tight group, with one leader."
John,10,17,"Yo, my Dad loves me so much 'cause I'm willing to sacrifice my life and then rise up again."
John,10,18,"No one can take it away from me, but I choose to give it up willingly. I have the authority to give it up, and I have the authority to take it back. This is a command I received from my Father."
John,10,19,"So, like, the Jews were all divided again because of what was being said."
John,10,20,"And lots of people were like, 'Dude's possessed and totally bonkers; why are you even listening to him?'"
John,10,21,"Some people were like, 'Nah, these ain't the words of someone possessed. Like, can a demon actually make a blind person see again?'"
John,10,22,"So, in Jerusalem, it was party time for the dedication feast, and, yeah, you guessed it, it was winter season."
John,10,23,And Jesus was just chillin' in the temple at Solomon's porch.
John,10,24,"So yeah, the Jews gathered around him and were like, 'Dude, stop leaving us hanging. If you're really the Christ, just say it straight up, no beating around the bush.'"
John,10,25,"Yo, like, I already told you, but you didn't believe me: the awesome things I do in the name of my Dad totally prove that I'm legit."
John,10,26,"But you don't believe, 'cause you ain't my fam, like I already told you."
John,10,27,"Yo, my sheep be all ears for my voice, and I totally recognize 'em and they straight up follow me:"
John,10,28,"And I'm hooking them up with eternal life; they ain't gonna disappear, and nobody can snatch them away from me."
John,10,29,"My Dad who hooked me up is like, the ultimate boss; nobody can even think about snatching me away from him."
John,10,30,Me and {my} Dad are like totally inseparable.
John,10,31,"And then the Jews, like, picked up some stones to, like, throw at him."
John,10,32,"Jesus was like, yo guys, I've been doing mad cool stuff straight from my pops. Which of those things are you trying to stone me for?"
John,10,33,"The Jewish peeps were like, 'We ain't about to stone you for being a good person, but because you're claiming to be God when you're just a regular human.'"
John,10,34,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, didn't you guys read your law? It straight up says, I said, 'You all are gods'."
John,10,35,"If God referred to them as gods because they received the word of God, and the scripture can't be messed with;"
John,10,36,"Are you seriously calling Him a blasphemer just because He claimed to be the Son of God, the one sent by the Father and set apart for a holy purpose?"
John,10,37,"If I'm not doing my Father's work, then please don't believe me."
John,10,38,"But if I go ahead and do it, even if you don't believe me, just check out the awesome stuff I'm gonna do: so you can see with your own eyes and believe that the Father is in me, and I'm in him."
John,10,39,"So they tried once more to catch him, but he totally dodged them and got away unscathed."
John,10,40,"Then Jesus dipped out, headed back across the Jordan to the spot where John first did his baptism thing, and he just chilled there for a while."
John,10,41,"So, a bunch of people started hanging out with him and were like, 'Yo, John didn't do any crazy supernatural stuff or anything, but everything he said about this guy was totally legit.'"
John,10,42,And a bunch of people started vibin' with him right there.
John,11,1,"There was this dude, Lazarus, from Bethany, where Mary and her sister Martha lived, and he was feeling sick."
John,11,2,"(OMG, it was Mary who like totally blessed the Lord with some bomb ointment and used her hair to wipe his feet. BTW, her bro Lazarus was super sick at the time.)"
John,11,3,"So his sisters hit him up like, yo Lord, check it, the homie you dig is feeling sick, man."
John,11,4,"When Jesus heard that, he was like, 'Chill guys, this sickness ain't gonna end in death. It's all about showing off God's glory, so that people will see how awesome the Son of God is.'"
John,11,5,"Jesus was totally vibin' with Martha, her sis, and Lazarus."
John,11,6,"So, when he found out that his friend was sick, he stayed put in that exact spot for a couple of days."
John,11,7,"And then he said to his squad, yo let's head back to Judaea."
John,11,8,"Yo, dude. The crew was like, 'Yo, Master, those Jewish folks were just trying to stone you. Are you seriously gonna go back there?'"
John,11,9,"Jesus was like, yo, there's like twelve hours in a day, you know? If someone's walking around during the day, they won't trip or anything, 'cause they can see what's up in this world."
John,11,10,"But like, if someone walks in the dark, they'll totally trip and fall 'cause there's, like, zero light inside them."
John,11,11,"So, like, Jesus was all like, 'Listen up guys, Lazarus is, you know, sleeping. But don't worry, I'm gonna go wake him up from his snooze party.'"
John,11,12,"So the disciples were like, 'Yo, dude, if he takes a nap, he'll be chillin'."
John,11,13,"But Jesus was actually talking about his own death, while they mistakenly thought he was just talking about catching some Z's."
John,11,14,"So Jesus was like, 'Guys, let me be clear, Lazarus is actually dead.'"
John,11,15,"And I'm stoked for you all that I wasn't there, so that you can believe. But let's go to him anyway."
John,11,16,"So Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to his homies, 'Yo, let's roll with Jesus and be down to ride or die with him.'"
John,11,17,"So, when Jesus showed up, he saw that the dude had been chillin' in the grave for a solid four days."
John,11,18,"So Bethany was pretty close to Jerusalem, about two miles away."
John,11,19,"A bunch of Jewish peeps rolled up to Martha and Mary's place, tryna give 'em some love and support 'cause their brother passed away."
John,11,20,"When Martha found out that Jesus was coming, she immediately went out to meet him. But Mary stayed inside the house."
John,11,21,"So like, Martha goes up to Jesus and she's all like, 'Yo Lord, if you were here, my bro wouldn't have died, you know?'"
John,11,22,"But yo, I totally know that right now, no matter what you ask God for, God's gonna hook you up, fam."
John,11,23,"Jesus was like, 'Don't worry fam, your bro gonna come back to life'."
John,11,24,"Martha's like, 'Yo, I know He'll totally come back to life when the final day of resurrection arrives.'"
John,11,25,"Yo, Jesus straight up told her, 'Listen up! I'm the whole package: resurrection and life. Anyone who puts their faith in me, even if they're gone, will live on, no cap.'"
John,11,26,And whoever stays true and believes in me will be forever alive. Do you believe this?
John,11,27,"She's like, yeah, dude: I totally believe that you're the Messiah, the Son of God, who's supposed to come into this world."
John,11,28,"After saying that, she bounced and slid into Mary's DMs, saying, 'The homie's here and wants to chat with you.'"
John,11,29,"When she found out, she got up right away and went to him."
John,11,30,"So Jesus hadn't actually arrived in the town yet, but was hanging out in the spot where Martha bumped into him."
John,11,31,"The Jewish peeps who were chillin' at Mary's crib noticed that she bounced up real quick and left. They peeped her and decided to roll out too, saying she's headin' to the tomb to cry there."
John,11,32,"So, like, when Mary finally arrived where Jesus was, and spotted him, she totally fell down at his feet and said to him, 'OMG, dude, if you had just been here, my brother wouldn't have died!'"
John,11,33,"So, like, when Jesus saw this girl crying, and the Jews who were with her crying too, he kinda felt it in his heart, man, like he got really worked up and bothered by it, you know?"
John,11,34,"And He was like, 'Yo, where'd you guys put him?' And they were like, 'Dude, come check it out yourself, Lord.'"
John,11,35,Jesus cried.
John,11,36,"The Jews were like, yo, check out how much he was feelin' for him!"
John,11,37,"So, like, some peeps were all like, yo, if this dude could totally make blind peeps see again, why couldn't he have, like, prevented this other dude from dying, ya know?"
John,11,38,"So Jesus, like, totally came up to the grave and was like, ugh, let out a sigh or something. It was this cool cave, ya know, and there was a big rock on top of it."
John,11,39,"Jesus was like, yo, move the stone. Then Martha, the sister of the dead dude, was all, like, Jesus, it's too late, he's already stinking, he's been dead for, like, four whole days."
John,11,40,"Jesus was like, 'Didn't I already tell you that if you had faith, you'd see how awesome God is?'"
John,11,41,"So, like, they removed the big stone from the spot where they put the dead guy. And Jesus looked up and said, 'Yo, Father, I appreciate that you totally heard me.'"
John,11,42,"And I knew you always got my back, but I had to say it out loud for the peeps around, so they can trust that you sent me."
John,11,43,"And like, he said it with so much power, shouting out at the top of his lungs: 'Lazarus, come outta there!'"
John,11,44,"The person who was dead like, totally woke up and came out wrapped up in graveclothes with his hands and feet bound and a napkin covering his face. Jesus was like, 'Unwrap him and set him free, yo!'"
John,11,45,"So, like, a bunch of Jews were hanging with Mary, and they saw all the amazing stuff that Jesus was doing, and then they totally believed in him."
John,11,46,"But like, there were some people who went and spilled the tea to the Pharisees, totally snitching on Jesus and letting them know all the crazy stuff He had been up to."
John,11,47,"So, like, the top priests and Pharisees got together, and they were all like, 'What should we do about this guy? He's, like, doing so many mind-blowing miracles!'"
John,11,48,"If we just leave him like that, everyone will vibe with him: and the Romans will come and snatch our spot and nation."
John,11,49,"And this dude, Caiaphas, he was the high priest that year, and he straight up told them, 'Y'all don't know a thing!'"
John,11,50,"And like, think about it, right? It's actually like, a good idea if one person takes the fall for the peeps instead of the entire crew getting messed up."
John,11,51,"And he wasn't just saying this on his own. As the high priest for that year, he actually predicted that Jesus would die for the entire nation."
John,11,52,"And not just for that one group, but also to bring together all of God's children who were scattered around."
John,11,53,"So, like, from that day on, they like got together and, you know, started planning how to, like, um, yeah, eliminate him."
John,11,54,"So Jesus didn't really hang out with the Jews anymore, but instead he dipped to a nearby country close to the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and chilled there with his homies, the disciples."
John,11,55,"The Jewish fam's passover was coming up, and tons of people bounced out of their hometowns to head to Jerusalem and get themselves all cleansed before the big event."
John,11,56,"So they started searching for Jesus and were talking amongst themselves, while hanging out at the temple like, 'What do you guys think? Is he not gonna show up to the feast or what?'"
John,11,57,"So, like, the chief priests and the Pharisees, you know, they were all like, 'If anyone knows where he is, like, spill the beans so we can, like, apprehend him.'"
John,12,1,"So like, before the passover celebration, Jesus rolls up to Bethany, where Lazarus was chilling. You know, the guy Jesus straight up brought back to life."
John,12,2,"So they threw him a lit dinner party, and Martha was the ultimate hostess, giving killer service. And guess what? Lazarus was right there, sitting at the table with them, making moves."
John,12,3,"So, Mary got some super expensive spikenard ointment, like, legit pricey, and she put it all on Jesus' feet and even used her hair to wipe them. The whole house was filled with the dope scent of that ointment."
John,12,4,"And then this dude named Judas Iscariot, who was Simon's homie, straight up decided to betray him."
John,12,5,"Dude, why didn't we sell this expensive ointment for like, three hundred bucks and give that money to those in need?"
John,12,6,"He said this not because he actually cared about helping the less fortunate, but because he was a sneaky thief who had control over the money bag and would take what people put in it."
John,12,7,"And Jesus was like, yo, leave her alone. She came prepared for my burial and stuff."
John,12,8,"You may always have the poor around, but I won't be around forever."
John,12,9,"So, like, word got out that Jesus was there and a bunch of Jewish peeps heard about it. And let me tell you, they weren't just there for Jesus, but also to catch a glimpse of Lazarus, the dude Jesus straight-up brought back to life. Crazy, right?"
John,12,10,"So, like, the head priests were, like, totally discussing how they could, you know, straight-up eliminate Lazarus too, bruh."
John,12,11,"So, like, lots of Jews started to bounce and actually believed in Jesus because of him, ya know."
John,12,12,"The next day, a lot of people showed up for the feast, and when they found out that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem,"
John,12,13,"They grabbed palm tree branches and went out to meet him, shouting, 'Hosanna! The King of Israel is coming in the name of the Lord, and he's totally blessed!'"
John,12,14,"And Jesus, as he was scrolling through the app, came across a cool ride and hopped on it, just like the prophecy said,"
John,12,15,"Chill out, daughter of Sion: check it out, your King is coming, chilling on the back of a donkey's baby."
John,12,16,"So, like, the disciples didn't really get it at first, you know? But then, when Jesus became super famous and stuff, they were like, 'Whoa, wait! This is what was written about Him!' And they were like, 'Dude, we totally did all these amazing things for Him!'"
John,12,17,"So like, the squad that was with him when he straight up brought Lazarus back to life from the grave, they were all witnesses, you know?"
John,12,18,"That's why the squad gathered around him, 'cause word got out that he pulled off this insane miracle."
John,12,19,"Yo, did you see how the Pharisees were like, 'Dude, we don't stand a chance'? Like, everyone is totally following him now."
John,12,20,There were a few Greek dudes who rolled up to the festival to worship:
John,12,21,"So this guy named Philip, who's from Bethsaida in Galilee, comes up to Philip like, 'Hey dude, we really wanna meet Jesus. Can you hook us up?'"
John,12,22,"Philip goes up to Andrew and tells him, and then Andrew and Philip go and tell Jesus."
John,12,23,"And Jesus was like, yo, it's about to go down. This is the moment when the Son of man is gonna be straight up glorified."
John,12,24,"I'm telling you, for real, unless a little grain of wheat falls into the ground and calls it quits, it's gonna stay by itself. But if it takes the plunge and says goodbye, it's gonna bring out a whole bunch of good stuff."
John,12,25,"If you're all about yourself, you'll end up losing everything; but if you're not into this whole self-obsessed lifestyle, you'll end up gaining something that lasts forever."
John,12,26,"If anyone wants to be on my side, they gotta stick with me. Wherever I go, my loyal squad goes too. And yo, if anyone's loyal to me, my pops will hook 'em up with some major respect."
John,12,27,"Dude, my soul is seriously freaking out right now. I mean, like, what should I even say? Yo, Father, can you, like, totally save me from this intense moment? But, hey, I get it, this is why I'm here in the first place, for this very moment."
John,12,28,"Yo, Dad, let your name shine bright. Suddenly, a dope voice from the heavens was like, 'I've already shown mad respect to your name, and I'm about to do it all over again.'"
John,12,29,"So, like, the people who were there, you know, like, they heard this sound, and some of them were, like, 'Oh, it's just thunder.' But then others were, like, 'Dude, I think an angel was talking to him.'"
John,12,30,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Nah, this voice ain't for me, it's for all y'all benefiting from it.'"
John,12,31,"Right now, the world is about to face the consequences: the ruler of this world will soon be overthrown."
John,12,32,"And yo, if I get hella famous and blow up, I'll attract all the homies towards me."
John,12,33,He was basically saying how he would kick the bucket.
John,12,34,"The peeps replied, like we've read the law and it's clear that Christ sticks around forever, so why you sayin' the Son of man gotta get lifted up? Like, who even is this Son of man?"
John,12,35,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Listen up, fam. The light ain't gonna be here forever, so make the most of it while you can. Don't wait 'til it's too late and darkness creeps in, 'cause then you'll be lost and clueless."
John,12,36,"While you still have the opportunity, believe in the truth and strive to become true followers. Jesus said this and then left, choosing to keep himself hidden from them."
John,12,37,"Even though he flexed so many epic miracles in front of them, they still didn't believe in him, smh:"
John,12,38,"So, basically, Isaiah's word came true when he was like, 'Yo, Lord, who's even gonna believe what we're saying? And who's gonna see how powerful the Lord is?'"
John,12,39,"So, like, they couldn't believe 'cause Esaias said this, you know,"
John,12,40,"He made them totally clueless and gave them a heart of stone, so they can't even see with their own eyes or get what's going on in their heart. If they could turn around and change, I would totally heal them."
John,12,41,Esaias was talking about Jesus and how awesome He looked when he saw His glory.
John,12,42,"Yo, even some important rulers were low-key into Him, but they didn't want to admit it 'cause the Pharisees would kick them out of the synagogue. So, they kept it on the down low."
John,12,43,"Because they were all about that clout from people, rather than that glory from God."
John,12,44,"Jesus was like, crying and he was all like, bro, if you believe in me, you're not just believing in me, but in the one who sent me, you know?"
John,12,45,"And anyone who peeps me, peeps the one who sent me, fam."
John,12,46,"I've arrived, bringing some lit vibes to this world, so anyone who's down to vibe with me won't have to dwell in the endless darkness."
John,12,47,"And if anyone listens to what I'm saying but doesn't believe, I'm not here to judge them. My mission isn't to judge the world, but to bring salvation to the world."
John,12,48,"If someone straight up rejects me and doesn't even listen to what I gotta say, they're gonna have someone else judging them. The things I've said? Yeah, those things are gonna be the ones to judge 'em on the final day."
John,12,49,"Yo, I ain't just spittin' my own words here. It's the Father who sent me, He's the one who gave me the lowdown on what to say and how to say it, no cap."
John,12,50,"And I know that when he says something, it's gonna lead to an epic life for sure. So, whatever I say, it's straight from the Father, just like he told me. No cap."
John,13,1,"So, right before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew it was time to peace out of this world and go back to the Father. He had mad love for his squad that was chillin' in the world, and he loved them to the max."
John,13,2,"And after dinner, the devil was like, totally messing with Judas Iscariot, Simon's homie, and convinced him to betray Jesus."
John,13,3,"Jesus, fully aware that the Father had entrusted him with everything, knowing that he came from God and was returning to God;"
John,13,4,"He got up from eating, took off his clothes, grabbed a towel, and wrapped it around himself."
John,13,5,"Then he pours water into a bowl and starts washing the feet of his homies, and dries them off with the towel he had around his waist."
John,13,6,"So Jesus goes up to Simon Peter and Peter's like, 'Dude, are you seriously gonna wash my feet?'"
John,13,7,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Bro, you don't get what I'm doing right now, but don't worry, you'll understand later.'"
John,13,8,"Peter's like, 'Nah, don't wash my feet, Jesus!' But Jesus is all like, 'Dude, if I don't clean you up, we can't be tight.'"
John,13,9,"Simon Peter was like, 'Yo, Lord, wash not just my feet, but also my hands and head.'"
John,13,10,"Jesus is like, dude, if you've already taken a shower, you don't need to wash your whole body again, just clean your feet and you're good to go. Like, you're already clean, but not all of you, you feel me?"
John,13,11,"Because he knew who would betray him, he said, 'Y'all ain't all innocent.'"
John,13,12,"So, like, after he finished giving their feet a nice wash and changed his clothes and sat back down, he was like, 'Do you guys even realize what I just did for you?'"
John,13,13,"You guys call me Master and Lord, and I gotta say, you're on point! 'Cause, like, that's exactly what I am, no cap."
John,13,14,"So, like, if I, your total boss, show you how it's done by washing your feet, then you better be washing each other's feet too."
John,13,15,"Yo, I've set the bar for you, so you should hook others up just like I did for you."
John,13,16,"Honestly, I'm telling you, a servant isn't higher up than their boss; and the one who's sent out isn't higher up than the one who sent them."
John,13,17,"If you're on top of these things, you're gonna be stoked if you actually follow through with them."
John,13,18,"Not gonna lie, I'm not talking about all of you. I know who I've chosen, but this is all going down so that the prophecy can be fulfilled. Yeah, the one who's been chowing down with me is actually gonna betray me. Can you believe that?"
John,13,19,"This is a heads up, so when it goes down, you can trust that it's me. Just making sure you're in the know."
John,13,20,"Honestly, I'm telling you, if you accept anyone I send your way, it's like accepting me. And when you accept me, you're accepting the one who sent me."
John,13,21,"After Jesus said this, he felt really down and was like, 'No joke, I'm telling you, one of you is gonna betray me.'"
John,13,22,"So like, the disciples were all looking at each other, confused af about who Jesus was talking about."
John,13,23,"So like, there was this one dude from Jesus' squad, chillin' like by Jesus' side, who Jesus totally had mad love for."
John,13,24,"So Simon Peter like gestured to him, telling him to ask who Jesus was talking about."
John,13,25,"As he was chillin' next to Jesus, he straight up asked him, 'Yo, bro, who's the one?'"
John,13,26,"Jesus was like, 'Yeah, the one I give this tasty piece of food to after dipping it, that's the guy.' So, Jesus dipped the food and gave it to Judas Iscariot, who was Simon's son. (By the way, 'sop' means a yummy morsel.)"
John,13,27,"And after sharing some food, Satan took control of him. Then Jesus said to him, 'If you're gonna do it, just do it already.'"
John,13,28,None of the squad at the table had a clue why he was saying this to him.
John,13,29,"Some of them were thinking that because Judas was in charge of the money, Jesus told him to buy what we needed for the feast or give something to the poor."
John,13,30,"After receiving the snack, he swiftly left the scene because it was already dark."
John,13,31,"So, like, Jesus was talking and stuff, and he was like, 'Now that I'm out here, the Son of man is getting mad famous, and God is getting even more famous because of me.'"
John,13,32,"If God receives major respect from that person, God will also give major respect to that person, and will immediately give major respect to that person."
John,13,33,"Hey, kiddos, I'll be hanging out with you for just a bit longer. You're gonna look for me, but like I told those Jewish peeps, you can't come where I'm headed. So, same goes for you now."
John,13,34,"Yo, listen up fam, I got a fresh command for you: Show love to each other, just like I've shown love to you. Spread that love around, man."
John,13,35,"This is how everyone will know that you're my squad, if you show love and support for one another."
John,13,36,"Simon Peter was like, 'Yo, where you headed, Lord?' And Jesus responded, 'Bro, where I'm going, you can't come with me right now. But don't worry, later on you'll be able to follow me.'"
John,13,37,"Peter was like, 'Yo, Lord, why can't I roll with you right now? I'm down to give up my life for you, fam.'"
John,13,38,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, you really think you'd be down to sacrifice your life for me?' For real, for real, I'm telling you, that rooster won't even start crowing until you've denied knowing me three times."
John,14,1,"Don't stress, fam: if you trust in God, trust in me too."
John,14,2,"Yo, in my Dad's crib, there are mad dope pads: if it wasn't true, I would've straight up told you. Imma go set up a spot for you, fam."
John,14,3,"And like, if I bounce and make a spot for you, I'll totally come back and bring you into my crib; so that where I'm at, you can kick it too, you know?"
John,14,4,"And like, you already know where I'm heading and you totally know the way to get there."
John,14,5,"Thomas said to him, bro, we have no idea where you're headed; like, how are we supposed to know the way?"
John,14,6,"Jesus is like, 'Yo bro, I'm the real deal. I'm the way to go, the truth to cling to, and the life to live for. Nobody can connect with the Father except through me."
John,14,7,"If y'all knew me, y'all would've known my Dad too. And now, y'all know him and have seen him."
John,14,8,"Yo, Philip was like, 'Yo Lord, can you like, bless us with a glimpse of the Father? That would totally satisfy us, man.'"
John,14,9,"Jesus was like, 'Dude, I've been around you for so long and you still don't get me, Philip? If you've seen me, you've seen the Father too. So why are you asking to see the Father?'"
John,14,10,"Don't you get that me and the Father are like totally connected? The stuff I say to you isn't just coming from me, but from the Father who's all up in me, making things happen."
John,14,11,"Listen up fam, trust and know that I'm one with the Father, and the Father's one with me. If not, just look at all the dope stuff I've been doing and believe that way."
John,14,12,"Seriously, seriously, listen up, if you're down with me, you'll do the same awesome things I do, and even more amazing stuff; 'cause I'm heading back to my Dad."
John,14,13,"And whatever you ask for in my name, I'll make it happen, so that the Father gets all the glory through the Son."
John,14,14,"If you ask for anything using my name, consider it done."
John,14,15,"If you're all about me, then stay loyal and do what I ask."
John,14,16,"And I'll hit up the Father, and he'll hook you up with another Homie, so they can stick with you forever."
John,14,17,"The Spirit of truth, ya know? The world can't even handle it 'cause they can't see or understand it like you can. But you? You're on a whole other level. It's chillin' with ya and gonna be inside of ya, no cap."
John,14,18,"I got you, fam. No need to stress. I'm coming through for you. {orphans: or, those feeling all alone}"
John,14,19,"In just a bit, the world won't spot me anymore, but you will: 'cause I'm alive, and you'll be too, fam."
John,14,20,"On that day, you'll finally understand that I exist within my Father, and you exist within me, and I exist within you."
John,14,21,"If you're down with my rules and actually follow 'em, then you're the one showing love for me. And if you've got love for me, my Father will show you love too. I'll have love for you as well and make my presence known to you, no doubt."
John,14,22,"Judas, not the Iscariot one, asks Jesus, 'Yo, Lord, how you gonna show yourself to us but not to the whole world?'"
John,14,23,"Yo, Jesus straight up told this dude, if you love me, you gotta walk the talk and do what I say. And if you do that, my Dad will love you, and we'll come chill with you, like make our crib with you."
John,14,24,"If you don't vibe with me, you ain't gonna follow my words. Just so you know, the things you hear me say ain't even from me, but straight from the Father who sent me."
John,14,25,I've like totally shared these things with you while being here and all.
John,14,26,"Yo, check this out: once Jesus was like, 'Hey y'all, listen up! The Holy Ghost, aka the ultimate Comforter, is gonna come to you straight from the Father. And guess what? He's got your back! He's gonna teach you everything and remind you of all the dope stuff I said to you before. No cap!"
John,14,27,"I'm leaving you with peace, straight from me to you. Not like the shallow peace that the world offers. So don't stress out or be scared, bro."
John,14,28,"So, like, you've probs heard me saying that I'm gonna peace out and then come back to you fam. If you really had love for me, you'd totally be stoked, 'cause I'm heading to the Father, who's actually way more boss than me."
John,14,29,"And now I've already warned you about this happening in advance, so that when it does happen, you'll believe it."
John,14,30,"I won't chat with you a lot from now on: 'cause the ruler of this world is gonna show up, but don't worry, he's got nothing on me."
John,14,31,"So that everyone knows I'm devoted to my Dad, just doing exactly what He told me to. Alright, let's get moving now!"
John,15,1,"I'm the real deal vine, and my Dad totally knows how to grow stuff."
John,15,2,"If any of y'all branches hangin' on to me don't bring forth fruit, I'm gonna have to cut 'em off. But the branches that actually do produce fruit, I'm gonna clean 'em up so they can bring even more fruit."
John,15,3,"Yo, y'all are totally pure 'cause of the words I dropped on ya."
John,15,4,"Stay connected with me and I'll stay connected with you. Just like a branch can't produce fruit on its own unless it stays connected to the vine, you won't be able to do much without staying connected to me."
John,15,5,"I'm the main source, you're the offshoots: If you stick with me and I with you, you'll produce a ton of goodness. 'Cause without me, you won't achieve anything worthwhile."
John,15,6,"If someone doesn't stick with me, they're tossed out like a dried-up branch, and people just toss them into the fire to burn."
John,15,7,"If you're vibin' with me and my words are vibin' with you, you can ask for whatever you want and it's gonna happen, no cap."
John,15,8,"This is how my Dad gets all the credit - when you're out there hustling and making things happen. That's when you prove you're on my squad, no doubt."
John,15,9,"Just like how the Father is all about love for me, I'm totally about spreading the love for you too: just keep on embracing the love I have for you."
John,15,10,"If you stay loyal to my rules, you'll stay in my good vibes, just like I stay loyal to my pops' rules and stay in his good vibes."
John,15,11,I'm telling you all this so that my happiness can stick with you and you can experience ultimate joy.
John,15,12,"Yo, listen up! Here's the deal: Love each other, just like I love you. That's my ulti-rule."
John,15,13,There's no greater love than when someone puts their life on the line for their homies.
John,15,14,"You're like, totally my squad, if you do everything I tell ya."
John,15,15,"From now on, I don't call you servants anymore; a servant doesn't know what their boss is up to. Instead, I call you friends because I've shared everything I've learned from my Father with you."
John,15,16,"You didn't choose me, but I chose you and gave you a purpose. I want you to go out and make a positive impact that lasts. And when you pray to God using my name, he'll give you what you ask for."
John,15,17,"I'm telling you this, so you can show some love to each other, you feel me?"
John,15,18,"If the world be dissing you, yo, you know it was dissin' me first before it dissed you."
John,15,19,"If you were all about that mainstream life, hanging with the crowd, the crowd would be all like 'yeah, we vibe with you, fam.' But because you're not about that basic life, I chose to bring you out of that lifestyle. So, it's no surprise that the world hates on you, cuz you're on a different wavelength, doing your thing."
John,15,20,"Yo, don't forget what I told you, bruh. A servant doesn't rank higher than his boss. If people gave me a hard time, best believe they'll give you a hard time too. And if they paid attention to what I had to say, they'll listen to you too, no doubt."
John,15,21,"But they'll totally throw all these things at you just 'cause you're repping my name. They're clueless about the one who sent me, though. Smh."
John,15,22,"If I didn't show up and talk to them, they wouldn't be responsible for their wrongdoings: but now they can't make excuses anymore."
John,15,23,"If someone despises me, they're despising my Father too."
John,15,24,"Yo, If I hadn't done these amazing things that nobody else ever did in front of them, they wouldn't have been guilty of sinning. But now they've seen it all and straight up despise both me and my Dad."
John,15,25,"But like, this is happening so that what was written in their law can be, like, fulfilled, ya know? It says, 'They totally hated me for no reason'."
John,15,26,"But when the real OG comes, who I'm gonna send your way from the big man upstairs, the Spirit of truth, who's rollin' with the Father, he's gonna vouch for me:"
John,15,27,"And you guys gonna flex too, 'cause you've been rollin' with me since day one."
John,16,1,"I'm just saying all this so you don't get triggered or start trippin', ya know? Like, I don't want you to feel scandalized or get all thrown off by what I'm sayin'."
John,16,2,"They'll kick you out of places of worship: yeah, there's gonna come a time when anyone who kills you will think they're doing it for God's approval."
John,16,3,"And, like, they'll totally do these things to you, 'cause they're clueless about the Father and don't even know me, you know?"
John,16,4,"But I just wanted to give you a heads-up about all this, so that when it goes down, you'll be like, 'Oh yeah, Jesus totally called it!' And just FYI, I didn't mention this stuff earlier because, well, I was actually physically hanging out with you guys back then."
John,16,5,"But now I'm outta here, heading back to the one who sent me. And none of you even bother to ask where I'm going, like, seriously?"
John,16,6,"But like, since I dropped these truth bombs on you, sadness has taken over your heart."
John,16,7,"But listen up, fam, I gotta keep it real with you: it's actually gonna be beneficial for all of you if I bounce. See, if I stick around, the Holy Spirit won't be able to come to you. But hey, once I dip, I'll make sure to send Him your way."
John,16,8,"And when he shows up, he's gonna call out the whole world for being way off track in the sin department, and he'll set things straight with righteousness and judgment. {reprove: or, convince}"
John,16,9,"It's all about that sin, because they straight up don't believe in me;"
John,16,10,"It's all about being righteous, you feel me? I'm about to bounce and reunite with my Father, and y'all won't be able to catch a glimpse of me no more."
John,16,11,"About judgment, 'cause the big boss of this world is totally judged."
John,16,12,"Guys, I've got a lot more to tell you, but I know you can't handle it right now."
John,16,13,"When the Spirit of truth shows up, they'll hook you up with all the legit knowledge. They won't even be all about themselves. They'll only speak what they hear and even clue you in on what's coming in the future."
John,16,14,He's gonna make me look awesome: because he's gonna take what's mine and show it to y'all.
John,16,15,"I've got everything that my OG dad has, so that's why I'm saying he's gonna take what's mine and show it to you."
John,16,16,"Okay, listen up fam, in a hot minute you won't spot me around, but wait for it, in just a little while, you'll catch a glimpse of me again 'cause I'm heading back to the Father's crib."
John,16,17,"So, like, a few of his followers were talking and wondering what he meant when he said, 'In a little while, you won't see me, but then in just a little while, you'll see me again.' And he mentioned something about going to the Father."
John,16,18,"So they were like, umm, what is he even saying? 'A little while'? We totally don't get it."
John,16,19,"Jesus already knew they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, 'Are you all wondering about what I said, like, when I mentioned that soon you won't see me for a bit, but then after that, you'll totally see me again?'"
John,16,20,"I'm telling you this for real - you're gonna cry and feel down, while everyone else is gonna be celebrating. You'll be feeling sad, but don't worry, because your sadness will eventually turn into happiness."
John,16,21,"When a girl is going through some serious labor pains, it's no joke. She's got a lot of sorrow because the time has finally come. But once that baby is out and in the world, all that pain is way in the back of her mind. She's too stoked 'cause a new human just joined the party!"
John,16,22,"So right now you're feeling all down and sad, but don't worry, I'll be back to cheer you up and make your heart full of joy again. And let me tell you, no one can ever steal that joy away from you."
John,16,23,"And on that day, you won't have any questions for me. Seriously, I'm telling you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, He'll hook you up with it."
John,16,24,"Up until now, you haven't really asked me for anything in my name. But now I'm telling you, go ahead and ask for whatever you need, and you'll get it. This way, your happiness will be off the charts!"
John,16,25,"I've been using some deep sayings to talk to you, but there's gonna come a time when I won't be all cryptic anymore and I'll straight up show you what the Father's all about."
John,16,26,"On that day, you can hit me up and ask for anything in my name. And yo, I ain't gonna front, I don't need to ask the Father on your behalf. It's like we tight like that, fam."
John,16,27,The big man up there loves y'all 'cause y'all loved me and believed that I'm straight from the man upstairs.
John,16,28,"I bounced out of the Father, and now I'm in this world: but wait, soon I'm dipping out of this world and heading back to the Father."
John,16,29,"His squad was like, 'Yo, you're being mad clear right now, no more cryptic talk.'"
John,16,30,We're totally convinced that you know everything and don't even need anyone to ask you questions. This makes us believe that you totally came from God.
John,16,31,"Jesus was like, 'You really think you believe now?'"
John,16,32,"Listen up, it's about to go down. Yup, the time has arrived, like right now, when all of you will go your separate ways, each to your own place, and leave me hanging alone. But guess what? Even though I'll be by myself, I won't actually be alone 'cause my pops will be right there with me. Oh, and by the way, 'his own' means their own homes."
John,16,33,"Yo, fam, I'm just dropping some truth bombs on you so you can find peace with me. Don't front, though, 'cause life ain't gonna be all rainbow and butterflies. It's gonna throw some tribulations your way. But check it, don't stress, 'cause I've straight up conquered this world."
John,17,1,"So, Jesus was like, speakin' these words and then he looked up to heaven and was like, 'Yo, Father, it's go time! Let's shine the spotlight on your boy, so your boy can also shine the spotlight on you:'"
John,17,2,"Yo, like, you gave him mad power over every human, so he can hook 'em up with eternal life, ya know? Only the ones you've given him though."
John,17,3,"And this is the key to living our best lives ever, that we can connect with you, the one and only legit God, and Jesus Christ, the epic Son you sent our way."
John,17,4,I've made you look awesome on this planet: I've totally nailed the tasks you assigned me!
John,17,5,"Yo Father, hook me up with some divine glory like we had back in the day before the whole world existed."
John,17,6,"I made Your name known to the peeps You gave me from the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to me. They've stayed true to Your word, fam."
John,17,7,Now they understand that everything you've given me comes from you.
John,17,8,"I've passed on the message you gave me to them, and they've totally received it and know for sure that I came from you. Plus, they believe that you sent me."
John,17,9,"I'm sending positive vibes for them: not for everyone out there, but specifically for those you've entrusted to me; they're totally yours, fam."
John,17,10,"All my stuff is yours, and all your stuff is mine; and I'm like, totally shining through them."
John,17,11,"And now I'm about to head out of this place, but my friends are still here. I'm coming to you, Holy Father. Please watch over those you've entrusted to me, so that we can stay united, just like we are."
John,17,12,"While I was chilling with them in the world, I always had their backs in your name: the squad that you gave me, I held it down and didn't lose anyone, except for that one betrayer; all part of the plan, just like how the prophecy said."
John,17,13,"Yo, now I'm coming to you, and I'm dropping some real talk so that they can experience the maximum joy that's straight from me, all up in themselves."
John,17,14,"I've shared your word with them, but the world straight-up hates them, 'cause they're not like everyone else. Just like how I'm not part of this whole world scene either."
John,17,15,"I'm not asking you to snatch them out of the scene, but to shield them from all the bad vibes."
John,17,16,"They don't fit into this world, just like I don't fit into this world."
John,17,17,"Make them holy by showing them what's really true: Your word is the raw, unfiltered truth."
John,17,18,"Just like you sent me out into the world, I'm sending them out into the world too."
John,17,19,"And for their sake, I set myself apart, so that they can also be set apart by living in truth. {set apart...: or, truly set apart}"
John,17,20,"I'm not just praying for these peeps, but also for those who will believe in me because of their words, ya know?"
John,17,21,"So that everyone can vibe together, just like how you, God, are within me and I'm in you, we want everyone to be united with us. This unity will show the world that you really sent me."
John,17,22,"And the mad respect and recognition you hooked me up with, I've passed it on to them; so they can be tight AF, just like we're tight AF:"
John,17,23,"I'm a part of them, and you're a part of me, so that they can be totally united; and so the whole world knows that you sent me, and that you love them just as much as you love me."
John,17,24,"Yo, Dad, I'm vibing with the idea that the squad you've blessed me with should chill with me wherever I'm at. That way, they can experience my epicness that you've blessed me with. You've had love for me since way before the world even existed."
John,17,25,"Yo, righteous Father, the world has no clue about you, but I've got that knowledge, and my squad knows that you sent me."
John,17,26,"And I've totally let them in on your name, and I'll keep on letting them know, so that the same love you've shown me can be in them, and I can be in them too."
John,18,1,"After Jesus dropped these lines, he and his squad headed over to the Cedron stream. There was this lit garden on the other side, so they all rolled in. Yolo!"
John,18,2,"And even Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew exactly where they were going. Jesus used to hang out there often with his squad."
John,18,3,"So, Judas, you know, he got this crew of people and some officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, and they all showed up at the place with flashlights, torches, and weapons."
John,18,4,"So like, Jesus already knew everything that was gonna happen to him, right? And then he, like, stepped forward and was like, 'Yo, who are you guys looking for?'"
John,18,5,"They were like, 'It's Jesus of Nazareth.' And Jesus was like, 'Yep, it's me.' Oh, and Judas, the one who backstabbed him, was standing right there with them."
John,18,6,"And like, the moment he was like, 'Yeah, it's me,' they all freaked out and like, straight up fell to the ground."
John,18,7,"He asked them again, 'Who are you looking for?' And they were like, Jesuss from Nazareth, duh.'"
John,18,8,"Jesus responded, I already told you that I'm the one you're looking for. So, if you want to find me, just let these people go."
John,18,9,"So that what he said would come true, like he said: I didn't lose any of the buddies you gave me."
John,18,10,"So Peter, equipped with a sword, whipped it out and sliced off the right ear of the high priest's servant, whose name was Malchus."
John,18,11,"Jesus told Peter, bro, chill with the sword and put it back in its case. Like, my Dad gave me this whole situation, should I not go through with it?"
John,18,12,"So, like, the whole crew of the Jews, along with their captain and officers, they grabbed Jesus and tied him up, you know?"
John,18,13,"Then they took him to Annas first, because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. And Annas sent Jesus, all tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest."
John,18,14,"So, like, there was this dude named Caiaphas, and he was all about telling the Jews that it was like, totally smart to sacrifice one guy for the sake of the people."
John,18,15,"So Simon Peter was like, 'Yo, I'm rollin' with Jesus,' and then there was this other follower who was tight with the high priest, and he tagged along with Jesus into the high priest's crib."
John,18,16,"But Peter stayed outside by the door. Then the other disciple, who was friends with the high priest, came out and talked to the person guarding the door, and let Peter in."
John,18,17,"The girl at the door asked Peter, 'Aren't you one of this guy's followers too?' And he was like, 'Nah, not me'."
John,18,18,"And there were these guys, the servants and the officers, just chilling by the cozy fire they made 'cause it was freezing outside. They were all trying to warm up, you know? And then there's Peter, standing with them, trying to warm himself up too."
John,18,19,"The high priest was like, yo Jesus, tell me about your squad and what you're teaching."
John,18,20,"Yo, Jesus was like, listen up, bro! I didn't hold back nothing when I was preaching. I dropped truth bombs for everyone to hear. I was teaching in the synagogue, at the temple, where all the Jewish peeps gather. And just FYI, I ain't keeping no secret messages on the down-low."
John,18,21,"Why are you asking me? Ask the people who heard me what I said. They know what I said, dude."
John,18,22,"And like, after he said that, one of the cops who was standing there totally smacked Jesus across the face, and was like, 'You gonna talk back to the high priest, bro?'"
John,18,23,"Jesus replied, if I said something bad, then point it out; but if I spoke the truth, why are you hitting me?"
John,18,24,"So like, Annas sent him all tied up to Caiaphas the high priest."
John,18,25,"And Simon Peter was chilling by the fire. They were like, 'Yo, aren't you one of his followers?' He was like, 'Nah, not me.'"
John,18,26,"So, like, this dude who was like related to the high priest's crew, like totally noticed that Peter, you know, the one who chopped off his ear, was chilling in the garden with Jesus, no cap?"
John,18,27,"Peter straight up denied again, and then the chicken started making noise."
John,18,28,"So they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate's crib for judgment. It was way too early, and they didn't enter the crib because they didn't want to get messed up, you know? They wanted to keep themselves clean for the passover feast."
John,18,29,"So Pilate came out to them and was like, 'Yo, what's the charge y'all got against this dude?'"
John,18,30,"They were like, 'If he wasn't a total troublemaker, we wouldn't have handed him over to you, dude.'"
John,18,31,"So Pilate was like, 'Alright, you guys take him and do whatever your laws say.' Then the Jews were like, 'Uh, sorry, but we can't execute anyone ourselves.'"
John,18,32,"So that what Jesus said would come true, you know? He totally predicted how he was gonna die and all."
John,18,33,"So, Pilate goes back into the judgment hall, calls Jesus over and straight up asks Him, 'Yo, bro, you claimin' to be the King of the Jews or what?'"
John,18,34,"Yo, did you come up with that question on your own or did someone else fill you in about me?"
John,18,35,"Pilate was like, 'Uhh, am I even a Jew? Your own people and the religious leaders handed you over to me. So, like, what did you even do?'"
John,18,36,"Jesus said, Yo, my kingdom ain't from this world, fam. If it was, you know my squad would be throwin' down to save me from the Jews. But nah, my kingdom ain't from here, yo."
John,18,37,"So Pilate was like, are you saying you're a king or what? And Jesus was like, yep, you got it. I was born for this, to bring the truth to the world. Anyone who's all about the truth listens up when I speak."
John,18,38,"Pilate was like, 'Yo, what's truth?' Then he dipped out and went back to the Jews, and was like, 'I gotta be real, this guy did nothing wrong.'"
John,18,39,"But you guys have this thing where I gotta let one person go during passover. So, do y'all want me to let go of the King of the Jews or what?"
John,18,40,"And everyone shouted once more, saying, Not this dude, but Barabbas. By the way, Barabbas was a total outlaw."
John,19,1,"So Pilate, like, totally took Jesus and whipped him, you know?"
John,19,2,Then the soldiers made a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head. They also dressed him in a cool purple robe.
John,19,3,"And they were like, 'Yo, sup, King of the Jews!' and then they straight up went and smacked him with their hands."
John,19,4,"So Pilate went out once more and said to them, 'Check it out, I'm bringing him out to you so you can see that I don't see anything wrong with him.'"
John,19,5,"Jesus stepped forward, rocking the thorns on his head and the sick purple robe. And {Pilate} was like, yo, check out this dude!"
John,19,6,"When the main priests and squad saw him, they were like, 'Nail him, nail him!' Pilate told them, 'You take him and nail him yourself, 'cause I can't find any wrongs in him.'"
John,19,7,"The Jews were like, 'Dude, according to our law, he deserves to be executed because he straight up claimed to be God's Son.'"
John,19,8,"When Pilate heard that, he got even more shook;"
John,19,9,"So like, Jesus went back inside the place where they were judging Him, and this guy asked Him where He was from. But Jesus didn't even say anything, man."
John,19,10,"Pilate was like, 'Yo, you not gonna say anything to me? Don't you know I got the power to put you on the cross or set you free?'"
John,19,11,"Jesus said, like, you wouldn't even have any power over me unless it was, like, given to you from above, you know? So, the one who handed me over to you has, like, committed the bigger sin, man."
John,19,12,"And from then on, Pilate really wanted to set him free: but the Jews were like, 'Yo, if you let this dude go, you're no friend of Caesar, 'cause anyone who declares themselves a king is straight up disrespecting Caesar.'"
John,19,13,"So when Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and took a seat on the judgement throne in a spot called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, it's called Gabbatha."
John,19,14,"So it was time to get ready for Passover, around noon-ish. And he says to the Jewish people, like, check it out, your King is right here!"
John,19,15,"But they were like, ugh, get rid of him, get rid of him, crucify him. Then Pilate was all like, seriously? Should I really crucify your so-called King? And the chief priests were like, nah fam, we only acknowledge Caesar as our king."
John,19,16,So he gave Jesus over to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.
John,19,17,"And he, carrying his cross, went to this spot called the Skull Place, also known as Golgotha in Hebrew:"
John,19,18,"They nailed him on a cross, with two others on each side, and Jesus in the middle."
John,19,19,"So Pilate made a caption and hung it on the cross. The words on it said, JESUSS FROM NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.'"
John,19,20,"Lots of Jewish people saw this sign because Jesus was crucified close to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin."
John,19,21,"So, like, the top priests of the Jews told Pilate not to write, 'The King of the Jews,' but instead to write that he claimed, 'I'm the King of the Jews.'"
John,19,22,"Pilate responded, like, what I just wrote is what I wrote, you know."
John,19,23,"So, like, once Jesus was crucified, the soldiers snagged his clothes and split them into four parts, giving each soldier a piece. Oh, and they didn't forget about his super cool seamless coat—it was woven all in one piece. So seamless, bro. No stitches needed. #Impressive"
John,19,24,"So, like, the soldiers were all like, 'Yo, let's not tear this thing into pieces. Instead, let's play a game to see who gets it.' They were tryna make that prophecy come true, the one that says, 'They split my clothes among themselves and gambled for my robe.' So yeah, the soldiers went ahead and did all that."
John,19,25,"So, like, right next to the cross of Jesus, there were his mom, his mom's sister, Mary who's married to Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. (By the way, Cleophas is also known as Clopas.)"
John,19,26,"So, like, when Jesus saw his mom and the homie disciple he really liked standing there, he was all like, 'Yo, Mom! Check out your new son!'"
John,19,27,"And he said to the friend, like check it out, that's your mom! And from that moment, the friend brought her to his crib."
John,19,28,"After this, Jesus, like, totally aware that everything was like, completed, so that the scripture would be, you know, fulfilled, was like, 'Yo, I'm thirsty.'"
John,19,29,"So there was this container filled with vinegar, and they took a sponge soaked in vinegar, placed it on some hyssop, and held it up to his mouth."
John,19,30,"So when Jesus finally got the vinegar, he was like, 'It's all done, fam.' Then he lowered his head and peace'd out."
John,19,31,"So, like, the Jews were, you know, doing their thing on the day before Sabbath, and they were all like, 'Yo, Pilate, can you please break their legs so they can be taken off the cross before the Sabbath starts?' 'Cause this Sabbath was like a super important one, you feel me?"
John,19,32,And then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first guy and the other dude who was getting nailed to the cross.
John,19,33,"But when they approached Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs:"
John,19,34,"Then this soldier straight up stabbed his side with a spear, and boom, out came blood and water like whoosh!"
John,19,35,"And the person who witnessed it gave a legit testimony, and their testimony is straight up facts: they know that what they're saying is true, so that you can believe it."
John,19,36,These things happened so that what the scripture said would come true: Not a single bone of his would be broken.
John,19,37,"And like, another scripture be like, yo, they gonna check out the dude they totally stabbed."
John,19,38,"So, like, Joseph of Arimathaea was totally a follower of Jesus, but he had to keep it on the DL because he was scared of the Jews, you know? Anyway, he went up to Pilate and asked if he could take Jesus' body, and Pilate was like, 'Yeah, go ahead, dude.' So Joseph went and took Jesus' body."
John,19,39,"Then Nicodemus showed up too, you know, the one who secretly visited Jesus at night. He came bearing a whopping hundred-pound mix of myrrh and aloes."
John,19,40,"So they took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen clothes with spices, just like the Jewish tradition of burying."
John,19,41,"Yo, where Jesus got nailed on the cross, there was this lit garden. And in the garden, there was a brand new burial spot, no one had ever been put there before."
John,19,42,"So they put Jesus there because it was the Jews' preparation day, and the tomb was close by."
John,20,1,"On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene showed up super early, even before the sun came up, at the tomb. And guess what? She saw that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb!"
John,20,2,"So, she starts sprinting towards Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus was super tight with, and she tells them, 'Guys, they've snatched the Lord from the tomb and we have no clue where they put him!'"
John,20,3,So Peter and the other disciple decided to leave and went to the tomb.
John,20,4,"So they like, both started running at the same time: and the other disciple, like, totally outran Peter and, like, got to the tomb first."
John,20,5,"So, like, he bent down and peeked inside, and saw the linen clothes just lying there; but, you know, he didn't go in or anything."
John,20,6,"So Simon Peter comes up, right behind, and he steps into the tomb, and peeps at the linen clothes just lying there,"
John,20,7,"And the napkin, that was like, around his head, not mixed in with the linen clothes, but all neat and folded in its own spot."
John,20,8,"So the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went in as well and he saw what was inside, and it was like a light bulb moment for him. He totally believed it!"
John,20,9,"Because, like, at that time they were totally clueless about the whole scripture thing, you know? They hadn't realized that it was, like, a given that he had to come back to life after being dead."
John,20,10,"After that, the homies dipped back to their crib."
John,20,11,"So, like, Mary was just chilling outside the tomb, totally devastated and crying her eyes out. She couldn't hold back her tears, yo. And then, she got down on her knees and peeped into the tomb, you know?"
John,20,12,"And wow, there were two angels decked out in all white, chilling - one at the head, and the other at the feet, where Jesus' body had been resting."
John,20,13,"And they're like, 'Yo, why you crying, girl?' Then she's like, 'Duh, they took my Lord and I have no idea where they put him.'"
John,20,14,"So, like, she said this and then she looked back and saw Jesus standing there, but she didn't even know it was Jesus."
John,20,15,"Jesus was like, 'Hey girl, why are you crying? Who you lookin' for?' She thought he was the gardener and said, 'Sir, if you took him somewhere, just tell me where he is and I'll handle it.'"
John,20,16,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, Mary.' And Mary was like, 'Sup, Rabboni!' Which means 'Master'."
John,20,17,"Jesus says to her, Don't touch me yet; I haven't gone up to my Dad yet. But go tell my crew that I'm heading up to my Dad, who is also your Dad, and my God, who is also your God."
John,20,18,"So Mary Magdalene came to the squad and was like, 'Guys, I just saw the Lord and he was talking to me and stuff.'"
John,20,19,"So, later that day, it was like Sunday, and the disciples were huddled together behind locked doors because they were scared of the Jews. Then Jesus appeared out of nowhere, right in the middle of them, and said, 'Hey, guys! Chill!'"
John,20,20,"And like, after he said that, he like showed his hands and side to them. And then the disciples were totally stoked when they saw the Lord."
John,20,21,"Jesus said to them once more, Hey, chill guys! Just like my Dad sent me, I'm sending you too."
John,20,22,"And like, after saying this, he was like, exhaling on them and stuff, and he said to them, 'Yo, take in the Holy Ghost, man:'"
John,20,23,"If you forgive someone's wrongdoings, they're forgiven; and if you hold onto someone's wrongdoings, they're not forgiven."
John,20,24,"Yo, Thomas, one of the twelve crew, also known as Didymus, wasn't chillin' with them when Jesus pulled up."
John,20,25,"The other homies were like, 'Yo, we saw the Lord!' But he was all, 'Nah, I need to see his hands with those nail marks and stick my finger in 'em, and even put my hand in his side, or I ain't gonna believe.'"
John,20,26,"And, like, eight days later, his squad was all gathered together again, including Thomas, ya know? And then Jesus suddenly showed up, even though the doors were totally closed, and he was like, 'What's up, guys? Peace out, y'all!'"
John,20,27,"And he said to Thomas, yo, come here and check this out - feel my hands with your finger, and put your hand in my side. Don't doubt, bro, just believe."
John,20,28,"And Thomas was like, 'Yo, Jesus, you're my main homie, bro! You're my Lord, my God, all in one!'"
John,20,29,"Jesus says to Thomas, like bro, I get why you believe 'cause you saw me and all, but real blessings go to those who haven't seen me, yet still believe."
John,20,30,"And Jesus did many other awesome things in front of his squad, stuff that didn't even make it into this book, you know?"
John,20,31,"These words are here so you can totally believe that Jesus is the ultimate, the Son of God; and by believing, you can have a lit life through his name."
John,21,1,"So, like, after everything that happened, Jesus made another appearance to his followers by the sea of Tiberias. And this is how he made himself known to them."
John,21,2,"So Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the Zebedee brothers, and two other disciples were all chillin' together."
John,21,3,"Yo, Simon Peter was like, 'Imma go fishing.' And his homies were like, Wordd, we rollin' with you.' So they hopped in a boat right away, but unlucky for them, they ain't catch a single thing that night."
John,21,4,"But when morning came, Jesus was standing on the shore. The disciples didn't recognize that it was Jesus though."
John,21,5,"Yo, Jesus was like, 'Yo, kiddos, you got any food?' And they were like, 'Nah, bro.'"
John,21,6,"Then he was like, 'Yo, throw the net on the right side of the boat and you'll catch some mad fish.' So they did, and there were so many fish that they couldn't even pull the net back in."
John,21,7,"So the disciple that Jesus loved said to Peter, 'Yo, it's the Lord!' When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he immediately threw on his fisherman's gear (since he was basically naked) and jumped into the sea."
John,21,8,"Then the rest of the squad hopped on a small boat (they weren't too far from shore, just about 200 cubits), while bringing in their haul of fish with a net."
John,21,9,"So when they finally arrived on land, they spotted a lit fire with some fresh fish and bread cooking on it."
John,21,10,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, bring me some of those fish you just caught.'"
John,21,11,"So, like, Simon Peter, he, like, takes the net and pulls it up, man, and check this out - it's filled to the brim with, like, a ton of massive fish, like, a whopping 153 of 'em, bro! And get this, even though there were so many fish, the net didn't even break, dude."
John,21,12,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, come eat with me.' And none of the disciples had the guts to be like, 'Bruh, who even are you?' They already knew it was the Lord."
John,21,13,"So Jesus shows up, grabs some bread and hands it to his crew, and does the same with fish."
John,21,14,"So, Jesus popped up for the third time in front of his disciples, after he came back from the dead."
John,21,15,"After they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?' Peter replied, 'Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.' Jesus said, 'Then take care of my lambs.'"
John,21,16,"He said to him again for the second time, Simon, bro of Jonas, do you like-like me? He said to him, Yeah, Lord; you know that I'm totally into you. He said to him, Take care of my squad."
John,21,17,"He asked him for the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? Peter was upset because he asked him for the third time, Do you love me? And he replied to him, Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Take care of my sheep."
John,21,18,"Yo, listen up! For real, I'm telling you this straight: Back when you were young, you used to dress yourself and go wherever you wanted to. But when you're old, you're gonna reach out your hands and someone else is gonna dress you up and take you places you wouldn't choose to go."
John,21,19,"Jesus said this to show how Peter would honor God through his death. After saying this, Jesus told him, 'Come with me.'"
John,21,20,"So Peter looks around and sees the disciple that Jesus really liked, who was following along. This was the same person who leaned on Jesus' chest during supper and asked, 'Yo, Lord, who's the one that's gonna betray you?'"
John,21,21,"When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, 'Hey, what's the plan for this guy?'"
John,21,22,"Jesus said to him, If I want him to wait until I come, why should you even care? Just focus on following me."
John,21,23,"So, word spread around among the crew that the rumor was that this follower wasn't gonna kick the bucket: however, Jesus didn't actually say that he wouldn't die; He just said, 'If I decide that he sticks around until I return, what's it to you?'"
John,21,24,This is the homie who's spilling the tea on what went down and put it all in writing: and we hella know that what he's saying is straight up facts.
John,21,25,"And Jesus, like, did so many other things, man. If we wrote all of them down, I bet even the whole world wouldn't have enough books to fit them all. That's a big flex. Amen, bro."
Acts,1,1,"Yo Theophilus, I've already dropped a sick account of everything Jesus did and taught before."
Acts,1,2,"So, like, before Jesus dipped, he made sure to give his chosen apostles some legit instructions through the Holy Ghost, you know?"
Acts,1,3,"And he totally proved that he was alive after everything he went through, with like, tons of undeniable evidence. He showed himself to them for like, 40 days and talked about all the cool stuff related to God's kingdom."
Acts,1,4,"So, when they were all together, He told them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the Father's promise, which He had spoken to them about before."
Acts,1,5,"So like, John totally baptized with water and stuff, but you guys are gonna be baptized with the Holy Ghost real soon, in just a few days. No cap."
Acts,1,6,"So, when everyone was gathered, they were like: 'Hey, dude, are you gonna bring back the kingdom to Israel now?'"
Acts,1,7,"And he was like, yo guys, it's not your deal to know all the the exact moments and stuff that only the Father has control over."
Acts,1,8,"Once the Holy Ghost comes into the picture, you'll gain some serious power - and it's not just for show. You'll become my personal squad, spreading the word about me in every corner of the world, starting with Jerusalem, then Judaea, next Samaria, and even to the farthest ends of the earth. Trust me, you'll be making waves with this divine force!"
Acts,1,9,"And, like, after he said all that, they were, like, watching and stuff, and suddenly he, like, totally vanished into thin air, and there was, like, this cloud that, like, whisked him away from their view and they couldn't see him no more."
Acts,1,10,"And like, as they were like, staring up at the sky watching Jesus go up, suddenly two dudes in, like, totally white clothes appeared beside them;"
Acts,1,11,"And they were like, 'Yo, dudes from Galilee, why you just standing there staring at the sky? Jesus, the same guy who went up to heaven, is gonna come back in the same way you saw him leave!'"
Acts,1,12,"So, they went back to Jerusalem from this place called Olivet, which is just a short distance away, the kind you can cover on a chill Sabbath day stroll."
Acts,1,13,"So after they arrived, they all went to this cool upper room, where Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James sonn of Alphaeus), Simon Zelotes, and Judas brotherr of James) were hanging out."
Acts,1,14,"Everyone stayed together and prayed and asked for things, including the women, Mary Jesuss' mom), and his friends."
Acts,1,15,"Yo, during that time, Peter stepped up in front of all the homies, and he was like, 'BTW, we had about 120 of us chillin' together, just FYI.'"
Acts,1,16,"Yo, dudes and dudettes, listen up! This scripture had to happen, like it was destined, you know? The Holy Ghost, through David, totally predicted what would go down with Judas, the guy who led the crew that captured Jesus."
Acts,1,17,"Yo, he was one of us, and he totally had a role in this ministry."
Acts,1,18,"So this dude bought a piece of land with some shady money, but then he tripped and fell so hard that he split open and his guts spilled out everywhere."
Acts,1,19,"And everybody in Jerusalem knew about it. They even had a name for that field in their own language, Aceldama, which means 'The field of blood'."
Acts,1,20,"As it says in the book of Psalms, his place should be empty and no one should live there anymore. Someone else should take over his position as bishop."
Acts,1,21,"So, like, out of all the dudes who've been chillin' with us the whole time Jesus was rollin' with us,"
Acts,1,22,"Yo, starting from when John baptized peeps, all the way up until the day he bounced from our crew, we gotta choose someone to be a witness of his comeback with us."
Acts,1,23,"So, they like picked these two dudes, Joseph, but also called Barsabas, and he had this cool nickname Justus, and then there's this other guy named Matthias."
Acts,1,24,"And they were like, yo, they prayed and were all like, 'Yo, Lord, you know everything about us, like our hearts and stuff. So, could you please let us know which one of these two people you've picked?'"
Acts,1,25,"So that he can join in this awesome ministry and apostleship, since Judas messed up and fell due to his actions, and went to his rightful place."
Acts,1,26,"So, like, they decided by drawing lots, and the chosen one was Matthias. He joined the gang of eleven apostles."
Acts,2,1,"And when it was time for Pentecost, they were all gathered together in one place, totally vibing."
Acts,2,2,"And out of nowhere, a crazy loud noise blasted from the sky, like a super strong gust of wind, and it filled up the whole place where they were all chilling."

Acts,2,47,"Yo, they were all about praising God and being cool with everyone. And the Lord kept bringing new people to the church every day, the ones who were meant to be saved, you know."

Acts,3,2,"There was this dude who couldn't walk since birth, so his homies would carry him and drop him off at the temple gate, which they called 'Beautiful'. He would ask for some cash from those who were heading into the temple."
Acts,3,3,"When this person spotted Peter and John heading towards the temple, they asked for some spare change."
Acts,3,4,"And Peter, like, totally locks eyes with the dude along with John, and he's all like, 'Yo, check us out, bro.'"

Acts,3,12,"And when Peter peeped {it}, he totally flexed on the peeps, saying, 'Yo men of Israel, why you trippin' over this? Or why you staring at us like we the ones who made this dude walk, like we some sorta magic wizards or holy beings?'"
Acts,3,13,"The OG God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, flexed on his Son Jesus. Y'all snitched and straight-up denied him when Pilate was about to let him slide."

Acts,3,15,"And they straight up took out the Prince of life, who God brought back from the dead; and we saw the whole thing go down. {Prince: or, Author}"
Acts,3,16,"And this guy got a major power-up, thanks to putting his trust in the name of Jesus. You all can see it with your own eyes: he's strong and healthy now, all thanks to the faith that comes from Jesus. He's flexing on all of you right here, right now."
Acts,3,17,"And yo, my peeps, I know that y'all did that foolishness 'cause y'all ain't know no better, just like them higher-ups did too."
Acts,3,18,"But like, God had already straight up told everyone through his prophets that Christ was gonna go through some serious suffering, and yo, he totally came through and made it happen just as he said."
Acts,3,19,"So, like, turn your life around and get with the program, so that all your mistakes can be totally erased, once God brings some awesome new vibes into the mix."
Acts,3,20,"And he's gonna send Jesus Christ, who was talked about before to y'all:"
Acts,3,21,"Yo, heaven's gotta hold on to this dude until everything's been fully restored. God's been speakin' through all his holy prophets since day one, so this ain't no joke."
Acts,3,22,"Yo, Moses straight up told our ancestors, Godd is gonna raise up a prophet for you guys, one of your own people, just like me. You gotta listen to whatever he says, no questions asked.'"
Acts,3,23,"And, like, anyone who doesn't listen to that prophet, they're gonna be totally wiped out from the crowd, you know?"
Acts,3,24,"Yeah, even all the prophets, starting from Samuel and all the ones after him, every single one of them has been telling us about these times."
Acts,3,25,"You guys are the descendants of the OG prophets and part of the deal that God made with our ancestors, Abraham in particular. He promised that through your crew, all the different fams on this planet would get blessed."
Acts,3,26,"Yo, dudes, God first raised up his Son Jesus and sent him to bless you by helping y'all turn away from your wrongdoings."
Acts,4,1,"So, like, while they were talking to the crowd, the priests, the temple leader, and the Sadducees showed up all of a sudden, ya know? (BTW, 'captain' could also mean 'ruler'.)"
Acts,4,2,They were really upset because these guys were out here teaching and spreading the word about Jesus rising from the dead.
Acts,4,3,So they grabbed them and kept them overnight until the next day because it was getting late in the evening.
Acts,4,4,"But, like, loads of them who heard the word were totally convinced and became believers; and, get this, there were approximately 5K guys who hopped on board with the movement."
Acts,4,5,"The next day, the leaders, influencers, and scholars,"
Acts,4,6,"So, like, Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all the other high priest's fam were all chilling together in Jerusalem."
Acts,4,7,"And when they placed them in the center, they questioned, like, how in the world did you guys pull this off? What's your secret sauce or what name are you working with?"
Acts,4,8,"So Peter, totally hyped up by the Holy Ghost, was like, 'Yo, all you boss people and OGs of Israel,'"
Acts,4,9,"If we get questioned today about the lit thing we did for that helpless dude, and how he got healed;"
Acts,4,10,"Listen up, everyone, including all the peeps in Israel! Just so you know, it's all about Jesus Christ from Nazareth, the one you guys crucified but God brought back from the dead. And it's all because of Him that this dude is standing before you all healed and complete."
Acts,4,11,"Yo, check it. This right here is the stone that you builders straight up slept on, but now it's the ultimate boss of the whole building."
Acts,4,12,"Yo, listen up! There ain't no other way to be saved except through this one name—none other, man! This name is the real deal, bro, the only one that can save us all. It's the name given to us peeps on earth, and it's the only ticket to salvation, no cap!"
Acts,4,13,"So, like, when they saw how Peter and John were, they were totally shocked, because they realized that these dudes weren't necessarily the most well-educated or knowledgeable ones. And yet, they were blown away by their confidence and courage. It was like, a total mind-blowing moment for them, and they realized that these two had definitely spent some quality time hanging out with Jesus."
Acts,4,14,"And like, when they saw the dude who was totally healed standing there with them, they were just speechless and couldn't even come up with anything to hate on him for, you know?"
Acts,4,15,"But like, they told them to get out of the meeting and then they started chatting with each other,"
Acts,4,16,"So, like, what should we do with these guys? 'Cause, you know, they totally pulled off a major flex with that miracle. Everyone in Jerusalem saw it, no cap. We can't deny that, for real."
Acts,4,17,"But, like, let's make it super clear to them that they better not go around telling more people about this, you know? We should totally warn them that they better not mention this name to anyone ever again."
Acts,4,18,"So, like, they totally told them to stop talking or preaching about Jesus and stuff."
Acts,4,19,"But Peter and John were like, wait a sec, listen up! You're telling us to obey you instead of God? Nah, man, you can judge for yourselves if that's right or not."
Acts,4,20,"Like, legit, there's no way we can stay silent about all the mind-blowing stuff we've witnessed firsthand, you know?"
Acts,4,21,"So, like, they were all up in their faces, threatening them and stuff, but they ended up just letting them go 'cause they couldn't find any way to punish them. The people were totally on their side and giving props to God for what went down. #Blessed"
Acts,4,22,"Bro, the dude who got healed was, like, over 40 years old. That's how epic this miracle was, man!"
Acts,4,23,"After they were released, they linked up with their crew and spilled all the tea on what the big shot religious leaders had told them."

Acts,4,27,"OMG, like seriously, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE - Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel - they all came together to mess with your holy kid, Jesus, whom you totally chose and put in charge. Like, no lie!"
Acts,4,28,"So, like, to do whatever your plans were all set for in advance, man."

Acts,4,33,"The apostles flexed their mad power and straight up vouched for Jesus coming back to life, yo. And everyone was feeling the absolute best vibes with all that grace flowing through them, no cap."
Acts,4,34,"And, like, nobody was left out, man. Everyone who had, like, tons of property or houses, they were selling them and using the money to help out, you know?"
Acts,4,35,And they put {them} at the apostles' feet: and gave out to each person according to what they needed.
Acts,4,36,"Now, there was this guy named Joses, cool name, right? Anyway, the apostles gave him this epic nickname, Barnabas, which means 'The Son of Consolation' (pretty uplifting, TBH). He was a Levite and hailed from the awesome country of Cyprus."
Acts,4,37,"They sold their land, brought the cash, and laid it down at the apostles' feet."
Acts,5,1,"So, there was this guy named Ananias who, along with his wife Sapphira, decided to sell something they owned."
Acts,5,2,"So like, this guy held onto some of the money, and his wife knew, and they only gave a portion of it and placed it at the feet of the apostles."
Acts,5,3,"Yo, Peter was like, 'Ananias, bruh, why you let Satan take over your heart and make you lie to the Holy Ghost, not coughing up the full price of the land? Like, why you gotta deceive like that?'"
Acts,5,4,"Dude, it was your possession when you had it, and even when you sold it, you still had the power over it. Why did you even think of doing this in your heart? It's not just a lie to people, but also to God."
Acts,5,5,"And Ananias was like, shook, and literally passed away: and it legit freaked everyone out who heard what went down."
Acts,5,6,"So the squad came through, wrapped him up, and flexed out while giving him a proper burial."
Acts,5,7,"About three hours later, his wifey, clueless about what went down, walked in."
Acts,5,8,"Then Peter was like, 'Dude, did you really sell the land for that much?' And she was like, 'Yeah, totally, for that much.'"
Acts,5,9,"Yo, Peter was like, 'Dude, what's up with you two teaming up to test the Spirit of the Lord? Check this out, those who buried your husband are waiting at the door, and they're gonna carry you out.'"
Acts,5,10,"Then she immediately collapsed at his feet, and passed away: and the young people came in, and discovered that she was deceased, and, carrying her outside, laid her to rest next to her husband."
Acts,5,11,"And everyone in the church was totally shook, even those who heard about it."
Acts,5,12,"The apostles were total legends, performing mad signs and wonders that blew people's minds. And get this, they were all chilling together in Solomon's porch, absolutely unified."
Acts,5,13,"Nobody wanted to be friends with them, but everyone thought they were super cool."
Acts,5,14,"And more and more people believed in the Lord and joined the crew, a whole bunch of guys and gals."
Acts,5,15,"So many people brought their sick friends and family to the streets, laying them on beds and couches, just hoping that Peter's shadow passing by would heal them. It was like they wanted even just a little bit of his shadow to cover them and bring them relief. (Or you could say: 'They brought the sick out into the streets and set them on beds and couches - even a passing shadow from Peter would bring healing and make a difference in their lives!')"
Acts,5,16,"A whole bunch of people from nearby towns came to Jerusalem, bringing those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits. And guess what? Everyone got healed."
Acts,5,17,"Yo, the high priest straight-up stood up, with all his homies rollin' deep (you know, the Sad Boys crew), and they were all, like, super heated, filled with mad envy and stuff, ya feel me?"
Acts,5,18,Then they like totally grabbed the apostles and threw them in the regular jail.
Acts,5,19,"Then, like, this angel dude from the Lord, came around during the night and straight up unlocked the prison doors, letting them out and stuff. And the angel was all like..."
Acts,5,20,"Yo, go flex in the temple and drop some truth bombs to everyone about living their best life."
Acts,5,21,"So, like, when they heard about it, they headed to the temple real early and started teaching. But then the high priest showed up with his squad, called for a big meeting with all the important people from Israel, and sent someone to the prison to bring the others."
Acts,5,22,"But like, when the cops showed up at the prison and couldn't find them, they went back and spilled the tea,"
Acts,5,23,"So basically, we thought the prison was locked up tight, with guards standing outside the doors and everything. But when we actually opened it up, turns out there was no one inside!"
Acts,5,24,"So, like, when the big shot religious leaders, along with the head of the temple and other important priests, heard what was going on, they started questioning where all of this was going. They were totally unsure about what was gonna happen next."
Acts,5,25,"Yo, listen up, someone just came and spilled the tea, saying like, check it out, those dudes you locked up are straight up standing in the temple, and dropping some knowledge on the crowd."
Acts,5,26,"So the captain and the officers went and brought them peacefully, because they were afraid of the people and didn't want them to get stoned."
Acts,5,27,"And like, when they had like, completely brought them over, they legit made them stand in front of the council, and the high priest straight up asked them, ya know?"
Acts,5,28,"They were like, 'Didn't we tell you to stop spreading this message? Look, you've gone and filled Jerusalem with your teachings, and now you're trying to blame us for this man's death.'"
Acts,5,29,"So, like Peter and the other apostles were all, 'Yo, we gotta do what God wants, not what people want.'"
Acts,5,30,"The Almighty OG of our ancestors brought Jesus into the mix, but y'all straight up killed him and left him hanging on a tree."
Acts,5,31,"God has totally raised Him up, like, with His right hand and made Him into this super cool Prince and Savior dude. His mission is to grant repentance to Israel and forgive everyone's sins. Pretty epic, right?"
Acts,5,32,"And we're totally witnesses to all of this; plus, the Holy Ghost is in on it too, 'cause God hooked up those who obey Him with it."
Acts,5,33,"When they heard that, they were shook to the core and decided to straight up kill them."
Acts,5,34,"So this one guy, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who was like a total expert in the law and everyone respected him, spoke up in the meeting. He was like, 'Okay, hold up, let's all chill for a sec and make the apostles step aside for a bit.'"
Acts,5,35,"Yo, listen up, people of Israel! Make sure you think twice about what you're planning to do with these dudes."
Acts,5,36,"Yo, way back in the day, there was this dude named Theudas, acting all high and mighty, claiming he's the real deal. He managed to gather around 400 followers, but in the end, he got killed and all his believers got scattered and came to nothing. (Believers: or, followers)"
Acts,5,37,"Then, this guy named Judas from Galilee came around during tax season and managed to persuade a lot of people to join his cause. But guess what? He ended up biting the dust, and all his followers, I mean every single one of them who believed in him, got scattered in the wind."
Acts,5,38,"Yo, listen up! I'm telling you, just stay away from these dudes. Let them do their thing, 'cause if their plans or what they're doing is just human stuff, it's gonna flop eventually."
Acts,5,39,"But if it's from God, you won't be able to stop it; unless you end up messing with God himself."
Acts,5,40,"So like, they were all like, 'yeah, sounds good' and then, they brought in the apostles, and, dude, they totally beat them up and then they were all like, 'Don't even mention this Jesus guy, okay? Cool? Alright, now scram!'"
Acts,5,41,"And they bounced outta that council meeting, stoked AF 'cause they were honored to take some serious heat for reppin' His name."
Acts,5,42,"And every single day, whether in the temple or in someone's crib, they never stopped dropping knowledge and spreading the word about Jesus Christ."
Acts,6,1,"So, like, back in the day when there were tons of disciples, there was some drama between the Grecians and the Hebrews. The Grecians started complaining because the Hebrews were totally neglecting their widows when it came to taking care of them every day."
Acts,6,2,"So the squad of twelve gathered all the homies who roll with them and said, 'Look, it don't make sense for us to ditch spreading the word of God and just handle mundane tasks.'"
Acts,6,3,"Yo fam, listen up! We need to find seven dudes among us who are legit trustworthy, like they got that Holy Ghost energy and wisdom, ya know? We gonna put them in charge of handling this business."
Acts,6,4,But we'll be totally committed to praying and spreading the good word.
Acts,6,5,"And everyone thought that was lit AF, so they picked Stephen, a solid dude with mad faith and the Holy Ghost vibes, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, who was a total Antioch fan."
Acts,6,6,"They brought them to the apostles and after praying, they placed their hands on them."
Acts,6,7,And God's message got more popular and the number of followers in Jerusalem grew a lot. Even a big group of priests started believing in the faith.
Acts,6,8,"And Stephen, like, totally had mad faith and power, and he straight up rocked it with all these mind-blowing wonders and miracles for the people."
Acts,6,9,"Yo, there were these guys from the synagogue, you know, the one called the synagogue of the Libertines, the Cyrenians, and the Alexandrians, and also folks from Cilicia and Asia, they were straight-up arguing with Stephen."
Acts,6,10,And they couldn't even handle the mad wisdom and the vibes he was throwing down.
Acts,6,11,"So, like, they paid some dudes to say, 'Yo, we heard this guy speak words disrespecting Moses and, like, God.'"
Acts,6,12,"And they got everyone all riled up - the older peeps, the smart ones - and swooped in on this dude, grabbed him, and hauled him off to the council."
Acts,6,13,"And they brought in fake witnesses who said, 'Yo, this dude won't stop spittin' straight fire, dissin' this sacred spot and the law:'"
Acts,6,14,"Yo, we've heard this dude say that Jesus from Nazareth is gonna wreck this whole place and shake up all the traditions Moses handed down to us. #savage"
Acts,6,15,"And everyone in the council was staring at him, totally mesmerized by his angelic-like face."
Acts,7,1,"The high priest was all like, 'Yo, is this stuff true or what?'"
Acts,7,2,"Yo, listen up guys, fam, and elders. The super amazing God showed up to our OG, Abraham, when he was chilling in Mesopotamia, before he settled down in Charran."
Acts,7,3,"He told him, 'Leave your hometown and your family and go to the place I'll show you.'"
Acts,7,4,"Then he left the Chaldean town and settled in Charran. After his dad passed away, he moved him to this place where you all live now."
Acts,7,5,"And he didn't even give him a single piece of the land, not even a spot to step on. But he made a promise that he would give it to him and his descendants in the future, even though he didn't have any kids at that time."
Acts,7,6,"And God was like, 'Listen up, His peeps will have to live in a totally weird place for a while and they’re gonna go through some tough times, like being slaves and being treated badly for, like, 400 years."
Acts,7,7,"God's gonna straight up judge the nation that's keeping them in bondage, and then they'll come outta there and do their thing for me in this spot."
Acts,7,8,"And he made a covenant with him to be circumcised, and that's how Abraham had Isaac, and he circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac had Jacob, and Jacob had the twelve patriarchs."
Acts,7,9,"So, like, the older peeps got super jelly and sold Joseph to Egypt, but don't worry, God was totally on his side,"
Acts,7,10,"And he totally rescued him from all the tough times he was in, and gave him sick respect and mad smarts in the eyes of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And then he made him the boss of all Egypt and his whole fam squad."
Acts,7,11,"So, like, there was this major famine that hit Egypt and Chanaan, and it was, like, super tough. Our ancestors couldn't find any food to survive, man."
Acts,7,12,"Yo, when Jacob found out there was some fire food in Egypt, he straight up sent our OG ancestors to check it out."
Acts,7,13,"And then, like, at the second time, Joseph finally revealed himself to his brothers, and Pharaoh was totally clued in on Joseph's family and stuff."
Acts,7,14,"So Joseph hit up his dad Jacob and all his fam, totaling 75 peeps."
Acts,7,15,"So like, Jacob went down to Egypt and he, along with our dads, died there."
Acts,7,16,"And they got moved to Sychem and placed in the tomb that Abraham bought from Emmor's sons in exchange for some cash, ya know, the father of Sychem."
Acts,7,17,"But, as the promise time approached, the one God swore to Abraham, the peeps in Egypt started growing like crazy and multiplied."
Acts,7,18,Then a new king came into power who didn't even know who Joseph was.
Acts,7,19,"They sneakily messed with our fam and mistreated our ancestors, to the point where they had to abandon their own kids just so they wouldn't survive."
Acts,7,20,"Back in the day, when Moses was born, he was, like, a total stunner, and his folks took care of him at home for three months. Can't deny, he was, like, blessed by the heavens or something."

Acts,7,23,"And when he turned 40 years old, he suddenly felt the urge to hang out with his homies, the Israelite squad."
Acts,7,24,"So this guy saw someone being treated unfairly, and he totally had their back. He made things right for the person who was being mistreated and straight up took down the Egyptian."
Acts,7,25,"He thought his squad would totally get that God was about to come through and rescue them by his power, but they just didn't get it. {For: or, Now}"
Acts,7,26,"And the next day, he made an appearance to them while they were arguing, and he tried to bring them back together, saying, 'Yo, guys! You're fam, so why you trippin' and treating each other wrong?'"
Acts,7,27,"But yo, the dude who did his homie dirty straight up dissed him, like, 'Who made you the boss and the judge of us?'"
Acts,7,28,Are you gonna take me out like you did with that Egyptian dude yesterday?
Acts,7,29,"Moses totally dipped after hearing this, and ended up being a total outsider in Madian. That's where he became a dad to two kids, you know."
Acts,7,30,"After like, a crazy 40 years, this dude saw this angel from God in the middle of this deserted mountain area, and the angel was literally on fire but in this cool bush."

Acts,7,32,"Like, yo, I'm the God of your fam, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And when Moses heard that, he was totally shook and couldn't even look."
Acts,7,33,"So, like, the Lord was all like, 'Hey dude, take off your shoes, man, 'cause the spot you're standing on is, like, sacred ground, you know?"
Acts,7,34,"Yo, I've totally peeped the struggle of my homies over in Egypt. Their groans have reached my ears, so I'm rolling up to save them. And now, you're up next - I'm sending you to Egypt."
Acts,7,35,"So, like, the people totally dissed Moses, saying, 'Who made you the boss and the judge?' But, bro, God straight up sent Moses to be the leader and the savior, using an angel that appeared to him in a burning bush. Can you believe it?"
Acts,7,36,"He flexed on them by doing crazy miracles and epic tricks in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and during their time in the desert for, like, forty whole years."
Acts,7,37,"So this is the OG Moses, who straight up told the Israelite crew that the Lord your God will raise up a prophet for y'all from among your own peeps, someone as cool as me. And y'all better listen up and pay attention to this dude. #NoCap"
Acts,7,38,"Yo, this dude was in the wilderness church chillin' with an angel who totally dropped some knowledge on him at Mount Sina, and, like, our ancestors were there too. They got these super lit messages to pass down to us."
Acts,7,39,"Our ancestors didn't want to listen, so they rejected {him} and deep down, they wanted to go back to Egypt."
Acts,7,40,"Aaron, can you, like, hook us up with some gods to lead the way? Cuz Moses, who took us outta Egypt, just dipped and we have no clue where he went."
Acts,7,41,"So, like, back in the day, they totally made this calf and started worshiping it. They were all into sacrificing and stuff, and they were like super proud of themselves and their handmade idol."
Acts,7,42,"So, like, God was kinda disappointed and all, and let them start worshipping like, celestial beings and stuff. You know, like it says in those ancient prophet writings, 'Hey, you guys from Israel, seriously? You've been sacrificing animals and making offerings for, like, a whole forty years while wandering in the desert?'"
Acts,7,43,"Yo, you straight up embraced the tabernacle of Moloch and your god Remphan's star, these symbols you made to worship them. Because of that, I'm gonna exile you even further than Babylon."
Acts,7,44,"Our ancestors had this special place called the tabernacle out in the wild. God told Moses exactly how to make it, down to every last detail."
Acts,7,45,"And after Jesus, our ancestors passed down this possession to the non-believers. God drove out the non-believers before our ancestors until David's time."
Acts,7,46,"Who totally vibed with God and was like, 'Bro, I gotta find the perfect crib for the God of Jacob.'"
Acts,7,47,"So Solomon, like, totally constructed this sick house for God."
Acts,7,48,"Yo, listen up. The Most High doesn't chill in buildings made by humans, ya feel? Just like the prophet said,"
Acts,7,49,"Heaven is like my throne, and earth's just my footstool. So, like, why bother building a house for me? The Lord's like, seriously, where do you even think I'd rest at?"
Acts,7,50,"Yo, didn't my hand create all of this?"
Acts,7,51,"You guys are like, so stubborn and closed-minded, refusing to listen to the Holy Ghost, just like your ancestors did and still do."
Acts,7,52,"Yo, think about this, fam. Our ancestors straight up persecuted all the prophets, no cap. They even killed those who tried to spread the word about the coming of the righteous dude. And now, it's on us, bros and babes. We be betraying and straight up murdering the real ones."
Acts,7,53,Those who got the rules straight from the angels but totally failed at keeping them.
Acts,7,54,"When they heard this, it hit them hard and they were totally furious."
Acts,7,55,"But yo, my guy was like, totally filled with the Holy Ghost, and he straight up looked up into heaven, with mad determination, and peeped the absolute glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, fam."

Acts,7,57,"And they were like, 'OMG!' and covered their ears, then all of them came at him together super fast!"
Acts,7,58,"So they totally kicked him out of the city and started throwing rocks at him, and the witnesses were like, 'You guys hold my stuff!' and they left it with this cool dude named Saul."
Acts,7,59,"And they brutally attacked Stephen, desperately reaching out to {God}, and saying, Yo Jesus, accept my spirit."
Acts,7,60,"Then, he got down on his knees and shouted loudly, like, 'Yo, God, please don't hold them accountable for this sin.' And after he said that, he peacefully passed away."
Acts,8,1,"So like, Saul was totally cool with this guy getting killed. And then, there was this major backlash against the church in Jerusalem. They were all forced to scatter throughout Judaea and Samaria, except for the apostles."
Acts,8,2,And some really religious dudes took Stephen {to his funeral} and were super sad about it.
Acts,8,3,"So, like, Saul was going all out against the church, straight up barging into people's houses and dragging both guys and girls off to jail."
Acts,8,4,"So, like, the peeps who got split up went around everywhere, spreading the message."
Acts,8,5,"So Philip like, headed to Samaria and started spreading the word about Jesus, you know."
Acts,8,6,"And like, everyone was totally into what Philip was saying, you know? They were all like, really listening and being like, 'Whoa!' because they saw the crazy miracles he was doing and stuff."
Acts,8,7,"Yo, there were like these evil spirits, going all crazy and shouting, but then they got totally kicked out of a bunch of people who were possessed by them. And check it out, loads of folks who had conditions like paralysis and being unable to walk, got straight up healed."
Acts,8,8,And the whole city was totally stoked!
Acts,8,9,"Yo, there was this dude named Simon in the city, who was into all this sorcery stuff. He had the people of Samaria straight-up mesmerized, claiming to be some kinda big shot."
Acts,8,10,"Everyone was totally obsessed with this guy, from the smallest to the biggest, declaring, 'Yo, this dude is straight up God's ultimate flex.'"
Acts,8,11,"And they were really into him, because he had been totally enchanting them with his wicked magic for, like, a really long time."
Acts,8,12,"But when they were vibing with Philip spreading the word about the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they decided to get baptized, men and women alike."
Acts,8,13,"So, like, Simon actually started believing too, and once he got baptized, he stuck around with Philip. He was totally amazed, checking out all the sick miracles and signs happening. Like, incredible stuff going on, ya know? (BTW, miracles means, like, signs and crazy awesome miracles, just fyi)"
Acts,8,14,"So, like, when the apostles in Jerusalem found out that Samaria was all about God's message, they were like, 'Yo, let's send Peter and John over there, fam:'"
Acts,8,15,"And when they came down, they started praying for them, so they could be blessed with the Holy Ghost:"
Acts,8,16,"(Because none of them had been baptized yet, they only received baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.)"
Acts,8,17,So they high-fived them and they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts,8,18,"And when Simon peeped that the apostles were handing out the Holy Ghost like hotcakes, he had the audacity to try and pay them for it,"
Acts,8,19,"Like, he was all like, 'Yo, I want that same superpower! Imagine if I could lay hands on someone and they'd instantly get the Holy Ghost! That'd be lit!'"
Acts,8,20,"But Peter was like, dude, your money's gonna go down the drain with you 'cause you thought you could buy God's gift with cash."
Acts,8,21,"You don't have a say in this, because God can see that your heart isn't genuine."
Acts,8,22,"So, like, seriously, you gotta change your ways and ask God for forgiveness, hoping that He will forgive the messed up thoughts in your heart."
Acts,8,23,I can totally tell that you're stuck in a bitter mindset and all wrapped up in doing shady stuff.
Acts,8,24,"So Simon replied, like guys, can you please ask the Lord to make sure none of the stuff you just talked about happens to me, you know?"
Acts,8,25,"After speaking up and spreading the message of the Lord, they made their way back to Jerusalem and continued spreading the good news in lots of villages inhabited by the Samaritans."
Acts,8,26,"So, like, this angel from God, right, starts chatting with Philip, and he's all like, 'Dude, get up and head south on this road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, you know? It's a total desert, FYI.'"
Acts,8,27,"So he got up and went: and suddenly, he saw this high-ranking dude from Ethiopia, who worked for Queen Candace in charge of all her riches. This guy had come to Jerusalem to worship."
Acts,8,28,"So this dude was like, heading back home, chillin' in his fancy ride, and he starts reading this old dude called Esaias, who's a prophet and stuff."
Acts,8,29,"And then the Spirit was like, 'Yo Philip, go up to that chariot and vibe with them'."
Acts,8,30,"So Philip quickly went over to him, and he heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah. Philip asked, 'Do you understand what you're reading?'}"
Acts,8,31,"And he was like, yo, how am I supposed to understand unless someone helps me out? So, he straight up asked Philip to come sit with him and give him some guidance."
Acts,8,32,"So the verse he was reading went like this: he was, like, led to the slaughter just like a helpless sheep, and he didn't even make a sound when they were shaving off his fleece, just like a quiet little lamb."
Acts,8,33,"When he was humiliated, he lost his chance to prove himself, and no one can truly understand who he really is. His life was tragically taken from this world."
Acts,8,34,"Yo, Philip, can you explain who the prophet is talkin' 'bout here? Is he talkin' 'bout himself or someone else?"
Acts,8,35,So Philip started explaining from that scripture and talked to him about Jesus.
Acts,8,36,"And as they were like, going on their way, they like came across some water, and the eunuch was like, 'Yo, check it, there's water here! What's stopping me from getting baptized?'"
Acts,8,37,"Philip was like, 'Yo, if you truly believe with your whole heart, then it's all good, you can do it.' And then the dude was like, 'For real, I totally believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'"
Acts,8,38,"Then he told the ride to chill: and both Philip and the eunuch hopped into the water, and he baptized him."
Acts,8,39,"And once they got out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord totally snatched Philip away, so the eunuch couldn't see him anymore. And then Philip went on his way totally hyped and stoked!"
Acts,8,40,"So Philip was hanging out in Azotus, just casually passing through and spreading the good word in all the cities. He didn't stop until he finally reached Caesarea."
Acts,9,1,"So this guy Saul, he was like totally seething with anger and wanted to annihilate all the followers of the Lord. He went straight to the high priest, yo!"
Acts,9,2,"So he asked for permission to send letters to the synagogues in Damascus. He wanted to find anyone who followed this way of life, whether they were guys or girls, and bring them back to Jerusalem as prisoners. {of this way: Gr. of the way}"
Acts,9,3,"And while he was traveling, he got close to Damascus, when all of a sudden, a super bright light from the sky surrounded him."
Acts,9,4,"And he totally like, fell to the ground and was like, whoa, and then heard this voice being all like, Saull, dude, Saul! Why you gotta be like, persecuting me?'"
Acts,9,5,"And he was like, 'Yo, who are you, bro?' And the Lord was like, 'Yo, I'm Jesus, the one you're giving all that hate to. It's gonna be tough for you to fight against the obstacles.'"
Acts,9,6,"He was shook and blown away, and he was like, 'Yo, Lord, what's the move? What do you want me to do?' And the Lord was all like, 'Get up and head into the city, and you'll find out what you need to do there, man.'"
Acts,9,7,"And his homies who rolled with him were straight up shook, 'cause they heard a voice but couldn't see anyone around."
Acts,9,8,"So Saul got up from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anyone. But they guided him by the hand and took him to Damascus."
Acts,9,9,"So basically, he couldn't see for, like, three days straight and was totally fasting from food and drinks too."
Acts,9,10,"So there was this follower named Ananias in Damascus, and the Lord appeared to him in a vision. The Lord called out to Ananias and he was like, 'Hey, what's up Lord?'"
Acts,9,11,"Then the Lord was like, yo dude, get up and go to the place called Straight Street. Go to Judas' crib and ask for this guy named Saul from Tarsus. 'Cause guess what? He's straight up praying!"
Acts,9,12,"So basically, Paul had this crazy vision where he saw this dude named Ananias walk in and lay hands on him to restore his sight."
Acts,9,13,"Yo, God, I've been hearing all over the place about this dude and how much trouble he's been causing for your followers in Jerusalem:"
Acts,9,14,"And like, he totally got permission from the top priests to capture all those who believe in you and stuff."
Acts,9,15,"But the Lord was like, 'Dude, go on your path because he's like, a totally chosen vessel for me. He's gonna represent my name to the non-believers, the VIPs, and even the people from Israel, man.'"
Acts,9,16,"I'm gonna make him go through some epic trials because of me, no cap."
Acts,9,17,"So Ananias went to the house and placed his hands on him, saying 'Yo, Saul, my dude, the Lord, Jesus himself, who showed up to you on your journey, sent me to help you regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost.'"
Acts,9,18,"And like, this dude's eyes suddenly, like, got rid of like these scales or whatever, and he like, totally got his sight back right away, and he got up and got baptized, man."
Acts,9,19,"And after he had grubbed, he felt so much better. Then Saul chilled with the crew in Damascus for a while."
Acts,9,20,"Without hesitation, he started spreading the word about Jesus in the synagogues, making it clear that Jesus is the Son of God."
Acts,9,21,"Everyone who heard {him} was totally shook and they were like, 'Wait, isn't this the dude who used to wreck those people in Jerusalem that were all about this name? And now he's here to capture them and take them to the big bosses?!"

Acts,9,23,"And after a long time, the Jews decided to plot his demise:"
Acts,9,24,"But Saul knew about their plan to ambush him. So, they kept a close eye on the gates, ready to take him out day and night."
Acts,9,25,"So, like, the disciples totally snuck him out at night and lowered him down the wall using, like, a basket."
Acts,9,26,"So, like, when Saul rolled up in Jerusalem, he tried to become, you know, part of the gang with the disciples. But they were all shook and didn't really trust that he was legit one of them."
Acts,9,27,"So, Barnabas grabs him and takes him to the apostles. He tells them all about how he actually saw the Lord on his journey and had a legit conversation with him. Plus, he spilled the tea about how fearlessly he preached in Jesus' name in Damascus."
Acts,9,28,"And he was, like, totally chillin' with them, going in and out of Jerusalem."
Acts,9,29,"So, he was like totally fearless and talked with so much confidence in the name of our main man, Jesus. He straight-up had arguments with those Greek peeps, but they were so salty, they wanted to straight-up end him."
Acts,9,30,"And when the squad found out about it, they took him to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus."
Acts,9,31,"So, like, all the churches in Judaea, Galilee, and Samaria were finally chillin' and had a break. They were gettin' all built up, you know, and walkin' in deep respect for the Lord and the rad comfort from the Holy Ghost. And, no doubt, they started multiplying like crazy!"
Acts,9,32,"So like, Peter was going around, traveling all over the place, and then he ended up reaching Lydda, where he met up with the awesome saints living there."

Acts,9,36,"So, there was this girl named Tabitha in Joppa - she was a total legend! People also called her Dorcas, which means 'doe' or 'roe'. This girl was all about doing good things and helping others out, like a real boss. She was always doing acts of kindness and charity."
Acts,9,37,"So like, back in the day, this girl got super sick and sadly died. But then they cleaned her up and put her in a room upstairs."
Acts,9,38,"So, since Lydda was like really close to Joppa, and the squad heard that Peter was chilling over there, they hit him up with two homies, asking him to slide through ASAP. They were lowkey begging him not to take too long, ya feel?"
Acts,9,39,"So Peter was like, 'Alright, bet' and joined them. When he got there, they took him to the fancy room upstairs. And all the widows were standing there, bawling their eyes out and flexing the dope clothes and outfits that Dorcas had made for them while she was still around."
Acts,9,40,"So like, Peter told everyone to leave the room and then he got down on his knees and prayed. Then he turned toward the body and was all like, 'Tabitha, wake up!' And guess what? She opened her eyes and sat up when she saw Peter, bro!"
Acts,9,41,"And he reached out to her, helping her stand up. Then, he gathered all the righteous ones and the widows, showing them that she was brought back to life."
Acts,9,42,"Everyone in Joppa found out about it, and a ton of people started believing in the Lord."

Acts,10,1,"Yo, there was this dude in Caesarea named Cornelius, who was like a boss in the group called the Italian gang."
Acts,10,2,"There was this super religious dude who was totally God-fearing, and his whole fam was too. He was all about helping people out, giving mad donations, and he stayed praying to God 24/7."
Acts,10,3,"So, like, Peter was totally having this vision, you know? It was around 3 PM, and then BAM! An angel from God straight up rolls in and is like, 'Yo, Peter, listen up! It's Cornelius time!'"
Acts,10,4,"But when he saw him, he got all scared and was like, 'Yo, what's up, bro?' And then the guy was like, 'Dude, your prayers and all the good stuff you've been doing are totally on God's radar.'"
Acts,10,5,"Yo, like, go find some dudes in Joppa and hit up this guy Simon, but he goes by Peter too, ya know?"
Acts,10,6,"He's crashing at Simon the tanner's place, right by the chill seaside vibes. Simon's got all the deets on what you need to do, so hit him up, fam."
Acts,10,7,"And after the angel finished talking to Cornelius, he called two of his homies who worked for him, and a super faithful soldier who was always on his grind;"
Acts,10,8,"And after explaining everything to them, he told them to go to Joppa."
Acts,10,9,"The next day, while they were traveling and getting closer to the city, Peter went up on the rooftop to pray at around noon:"
Acts,10,10,"And he was like so hungry, like he needed to eat ASAP: but while they were getting the food ready, he totally zoned out, man,"
Acts,10,11,"And like, the sky opened up, and this totally rad thing started coming down towards him. It looked like a massive sheet with corners all tied up, and it was slowly lowered to the ground, you know?"
Acts,10,12,"And there were all sorts of cool animals on land, like four-footed creatures, wild beasts, sneaky crawlies, and awesome birds flying in the sky."
Acts,10,13,"And then a voice came to him saying, 'Yo, Peter! Get up and slay some grub.'"
Acts,10,14,"But Peter was like, uh-uh, no way, Lord; 'cause I've never had anything that's basic or nasty."
Acts,10,15,"Then the voice spoke to him again, this time saying, don't consider anything that God has made clean as ordinary or insignificant."
Acts,10,16,"This happened three times, and the object was taken back up to heaven."
Acts,10,17,"So, like, while Peter was, like, super confused about what this vision meant, you know, he saw, check it out, these dudes from Cornelius, they came and were looking for Simon's house, and, like, they were standing outside the gate, just waiting there, you know?"
Acts,10,18,"So they hit up, like, the spot and asked if Simon, also known as Peter, was crashing there."
Acts,10,19,"As Peter was pondering on that mind-blowing vision, the Spirit was like, 'Yo bro, check it out – three dudes are looking for you.'"
Acts,10,20,"So like, get up and go along with them without second-guessing, 'cause I totally sent them, no doubt."
Acts,10,21,"So, Peter went over to the guys that Cornelius had sent and was like, 'Yo, I'm the one you're looking for. What's up? Why'd you come here?"
Acts,10,22,"So, like, Cornelius the centurion, he's totally this righteous dude who's all about fearing God, you know? And he's got this awesome reputation among all the Jewish peeps. Turns out, God hit him up through a legit holy angel, telling him to invite you to his crib and listen to what you gotta say, man."
Acts,10,23,"So he invited them in and let them stay for the night. Then on the next day, Peter hit the road with them, and some homies from Joppa tagged along."
Acts,10,24,The next day they rolled into Caesarea. And Cornelius was stoked and gathered his squad and closest peeps.
Acts,10,25,"So, like, when Peter walked in, Cornelius, like, totally met him and, get this, fell down at his feet and worshiped him."
Acts,10,26,"But Peter was like, 'Yo, get up! I'm just a regular dude too.'"
Acts,10,27,"And as they were chatting, he entered the place and saw that a lot of people had gathered."
Acts,10,28,"And he was like, you guys, you know it's like super not cool for a Jewish dude to hang out with or even talk to someone from a different nation, right? But then God totally showed me that I shouldn't judge anyone as unworthy or uncool."
Acts,10,29,"So, I came to you without any hesitation when I received your message. Now, I'm curious about why you called me here. What's the reason behind it?"
Acts,10,30,"So, like, four days ago, I was, like, fasting until now, you know? And at around three in the afternoon, I prayed at my crib, and, yo, out of nowhere, this dude shows up in some lit outfit."
Acts,10,31,"Yo, Cornelius! God's been listening to your prayers and He's totally got your acts of kindness on His radar."
Acts,10,32,"So like, yo, send a message to Joppa and tell Simon, aka Peter, to come here. He's crashing at Simon the tanner's beachfront crib. When he rolls through, he'll chat with you, fam."
Acts,10,33,"So like, I totally hit you up ASAP, and you did a solid job by showing up. Right now, we're all gathered here in front of God, ready to listen to everything He's commanded you to say."
Acts,10,34,"So, Peter starts talking and he's like, 'Dude, I totally get it! God doesn't play favorites with people!'"
Acts,10,35,"But like, no matter where you're from, if you respect God and try to be a good person, He's totally cool with you."
Acts,10,36,"Yo, listen up! God sent this message to the Israel homies, spreading the word about peace through Jesus Christ (aka the Ultimate Boss)."
Acts,10,37,"Yo, you all know about that thing, you know, that was all over Judaea, and it all started in Galilee after John did his baptism thing."

Acts,10,40,God brought him back to life on the third day and made a big show of it for everyone to see;
Acts,10,41,"Not for everyone, but for a select crew handpicked by God, even for us, who had a lit feast with Him after He came back from the dead."

Acts,10,45,"Those who believed and were part of the circumcision were totally shook when they saw that even the non-Jewish peeps, who were with Peter, received the Holy Spirit like a massive gift drop."
Acts,10,46,"Because they heard them speaking in different languages, praising and glorifying God. Then Peter replied,"
Acts,10,47,"Like, seriously, who can actually stop these peeps from getting baptized, especially when they've already received the Holy Ghost just like we did?"
Acts,10,48,"And he was like, yo, get baptized in the name of the Lord. And then they were like, bro, can you please stick around for a few days?"
Acts,11,1,"And like, the apostles and all the homies in Judaea found out that the Gentiles were getting down with the word of God too."
Acts,11,2,"So, Peter went up to Jerusalem, and those who followed the old customs had a big disagreement with him,"
Acts,11,3,"They were like, 'Dude, you totally hung out with those uncircumcised guys and even ate with them.'"
Acts,11,4,"So Peter basically went through the whole story from the very beginning, breaking it down step by step for everyone's understanding, and he was like,"
Acts,11,5,"So, like, I was in Joppa, just chilling and saying my prayers, you know? And all of a sudden, I get into this crazy trance and see this wild vision. It's like this massive sheet coming down from the sky, held up by four corners, and it straight up comes right to me! Can you believe it?"
Acts,11,6,"So, like, I was totally staring at it, right? And I started thinking, and I saw all these four-legged creatures, you know, like animals and stuff, and even some sneaky crawlers, and birds flying above me, dude."
Acts,11,7,"Then I heard a voice telling me, Yo, Peter! Get up and munch on this!"
Acts,11,8,"But I was like, hold up, Lord: like, seriously, nothing ordinary or gross has ever touched my mouth."
Acts,11,9,"Yo, man, the voice from heaven spoke again and said, 'Don't go around calling something common that God has already made clean.'"
Acts,11,10,"And they did this three times, and then they were all lifted back up into heaven."
Acts,11,11,"So, like, out of nowhere, three dudes showed up at the house where I was chilling. Turns out, they got sent to me all the way from Caesarea."
Acts,11,12,"And the Spirit was like, 'Yo, just go with them. Don't even trip.' And yo, six homies came along with me, and we rolled up to the dude's crib:"
Acts,11,13,"So, like, he tells us this awesome story about how he saw this angel in his crib and the angel straight up tells him to send some dudes to Joppa to find this guy named Simon, but he goes by Peter."
Acts,11,14,Who's gonna drop some real knowledge that'll save you and your whole fam?

Acts,11,17,"Yo, just peep this: God hooked them up with the same gift as us, who straight up believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So, like, who am I to even try to resist God, you feel me?"

Acts,12,2,"And he totally took out James, bro of John, with a freakin' sword."
Acts,12,3,"And since he saw that the Jews were into it, he went ahead and nabbed Peter too. (Just so you know, it was during the days when everyone was avoiding leavened bread.)"

They managed to befriend Blastus, who was like the king's personal assistant, and they wanted peace because their land relied on the king's support. (Being annoyed: or, having a bad attitude, thinking about starting a war) (the king's personal assistant: Gr. the one in charge of the king's bedroom)"
