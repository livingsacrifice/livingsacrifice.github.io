1 Chronicles,29,28,"Then he died at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer,"
1 Chronicles,29,30,with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
2 Chronicles,1,1,"Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great."
2 Chronicles,1,2,"Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers' houses."
2 Chronicles,1,3,"And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there."
2 Chronicles,1,4,"(But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)"
2 Chronicles,1,5,"Moreover, the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly resorted to it."
2 Chronicles,1,6,"And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it."
2 Chronicles,1,7,"In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, ""Ask what I shall give you."""
2 Chronicles,1,8,"And Solomon said to God, ""You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"O LORD God, let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth."
2 Chronicles,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?"""
2 Chronicles,1,11,"God answered Solomon, ""Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king,"
2 Chronicles,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like."""
2 Chronicles,1,13,"So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel."
2 Chronicles,1,14,"Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."

2 Chronicles,2,5,"The house that I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,"But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?"
2 Chronicles,2,7,"So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants,"
2 Chronicles,2,9,"to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful."
2 Chronicles,2,10,"I will give for your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, 20,000 cors of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil."""
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, ""Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them."""
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Hiram also said, ""Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, who has discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,"""Now I have sent a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi,"
2 Chronicles,2,14,"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem."""

2 Chronicles,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
2 Chronicles,3,2,He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,3,3,"These are Solomon's measurements for building the house of God: the length, in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
2 Chronicles,3,4,"The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,3,5,The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold and made palms and chains on it.
2 Chronicles,3,6,He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles,3,7,"So he lined the house with gold--its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors--and he carved cherubim on the walls."

2 Chronicles,3,14,"And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it."
2 Chronicles,3,15,"In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each."
2 Chronicles,3,16,"He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains."
2 Chronicles,3,17,"He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz."
2 Chronicles,4,1,"He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high."
2 Chronicles,4,2,"Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"Under it were figures of gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"Its thickness was a handbreadth. And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held 3,000 baths."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold."
2 Chronicles,4,9,He made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with bronze.
2 Chronicles,4,10,And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
2 Chronicles,4,11,"Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:"
2 Chronicles,4,12,"the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;"
2 Chronicles,4,13,"and the 400 pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars."

2 Chronicles,4,15,"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it."
2 Chronicles,4,16,"The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,4,17,"In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah."
2 Chronicles,4,18,"Solomon made all these things in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze was not sought."
2 Chronicles,4,19,"So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,"
2 Chronicles,4,20,"the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;"
2 Chronicles,4,21,"the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;"

2 Chronicles,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, and stored the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God."
2 Chronicles,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion."
2 Chronicles,5,3,And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,5,4,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark."
2 Chronicles,5,5,"And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up."
2 Chronicles,5,6,"And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered."
2 Chronicles,5,7,"Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim."
2 Chronicles,5,8,"The cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles."
2 Chronicles,5,9,"And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day."
2 Chronicles,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,5,11,"And when the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without regard to their divisions,"
2 Chronicles,5,12,"and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with 120 priests who were trumpeters;"
2 Chronicles,5,13,"and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD), and when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the LORD, ""For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever,""the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,"
2 Chronicles,5,14,"so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then Solomon said, ""The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness."
2 Chronicles,6,2,"But I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever."""
2 Chronicles,6,3,"Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood."
2 Chronicles,6,4,"And he said, ""Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"'Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;"
2 Chronicles,6,6,"but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'"
2 Chronicles,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,8,"But the LORD said to David my father, 'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart."
2 Chronicles,6,9,"Nevertheless, it is not you who shall build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'"
2 Chronicles,6,10,"Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,11,"And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel."""
2 Chronicles,6,12,Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
2 Chronicles,6,13,"Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court, and he stood on it. Then he knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven,"
2 Chronicles,6,14,"and said, ""O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart,"
2 Chronicles,6,15,"who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day."
2 Chronicles,6,16,"Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.'"
2 Chronicles,6,17,"Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"""But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built!"
2 Chronicles,6,19,"Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you,"
2 Chronicles,6,20,"that your eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where you have promised to set your name, that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place."
2 Chronicles,6,21,"And listen to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen from heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive."
2 Chronicles,6,22,"""If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"then hear from heaven and act and judge your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"""If your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,25,then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to them and to their fathers.
2 Chronicles,6,26,"""When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance."
2 Chronicles,6,28,"""If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemies besiege them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,"
2 Chronicles,6,29,"whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own sorrow and stretching out his hands toward this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways, for you, you only, know the hearts of the children of mankind,"
2 Chronicles,6,31,that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.
2 Chronicles,6,32,"""Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for the sake of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when he comes and prays toward this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"hear from heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name."
2 Chronicles,6,34,"""If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,35,"then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause."
2 Chronicles,6,36,"""If they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near,"
2 Chronicles,6,37,"yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,'"
2 Chronicles,6,38,"if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their captivity to which they were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,39,"then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, and maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you."
2 Chronicles,6,40,"Now, O my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"""And now arise, O LORD God, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. Let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in your goodness."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"O LORD God, do not turn away the face of your anointed one! Remember your steadfast love for David your servant."""
2 Chronicles,7,1,"As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
2 Chronicles,7,2,"And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD's house."
2 Chronicles,7,3,"When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, ""For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever."""
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.
2 Chronicles,7,5,"King Solomon offered as a sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God."
2 Chronicles,7,6,"The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD--for his steadfast love endures forever--whenever David offered praises by their ministry; opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat."
2 Chronicles,7,8,"At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,7,9,"And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days."
2 Chronicles,7,10,"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity that the LORD had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people."
2 Chronicles,7,11,Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house. All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house he successfully accomplished.
2 Chronicles,7,12,"Then the LORD appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: ""I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice."
2 Chronicles,7,13,"When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land."
2 Chronicles,7,15,Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
2 Chronicles,7,17,"And as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules,"
2 Chronicles,7,18,"then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to rule Israel.'"
2 Chronicles,7,19,"""But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,"
2 Chronicles,7,20,"then I will pluck you up from my land that I have given you, and this house that I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.'"""
2 Chronicles,8,1,"At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,"
2 Chronicles,8,2,"Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them."
2 Chronicles,8,3,And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.
2 Chronicles,8,5,"He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,"
2 Chronicles,8,6,"and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
2 Chronicles,8,7,"All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,8,8,"from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed--these Solomon drafted as forced labor, and so they are to this day."
2 Chronicles,8,9,"But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen."
2 Chronicles,8,10,"And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people."
2 Chronicles,8,11,"Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, ""My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy."""
2 Chronicles,8,12,"Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD that he had built before the vestibule,"
2 Chronicles,8,13,"as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts--the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David the man of God had commanded."
2 Chronicles,8,15,And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.
2 Chronicles,8,16,Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from the day the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
2 Chronicles,8,17,"Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom."
2 Chronicles,8,18,"And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind."
2 Chronicles,9,2,And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,"
2 Chronicles,9,4,"the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her."
2 Chronicles,9,5,"And she said to the king, ""The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,"
2 Chronicles,9,6,"but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report that I heard."
2 Chronicles,9,7,"Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!"
2 Chronicles,9,8,"Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness."""
2 Chronicles,9,9,"Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,10,"Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones."
2 Chronicles,9,11,"And the king made from the algum wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers. There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah."
2 Chronicles,9,12,"And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants."
2 Chronicles,9,13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,"
2 Chronicles,9,14,besides that which the explorers and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,15,King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of beaten gold went into each shield.
2 Chronicles,9,16,And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; 300 shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles,9,17,The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,9,18,"The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,"
2 Chronicles,9,19,"while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,21,"For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks."
2 Chronicles,9,22,Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
2 Chronicles,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind."
2 Chronicles,9,24,"Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year."
2 Chronicles,9,25,"And Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,9,26,And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,9,27,"And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah."
2 Chronicles,9,28,And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
2 Chronicles,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,"And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,10,1,"Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king."
2 Chronicles,10,2,"And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"""Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you."""
2 Chronicles,10,5,"He said to them, ""Come to me again in three days."" So the people went away."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, ""How do you advise me to answer this people?"""
2 Chronicles,10,7,"And they said to him, ""If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."""
2 Chronicles,10,8,"But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him."
2 Chronicles,10,9,"And he said to them, ""What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"""
2 Chronicles,10,10,"And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, ""Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us'; thus shall you say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs."
2 Chronicles,10,11,"And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"""
2 Chronicles,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, ""Come to me again the third day."""
2 Chronicles,10,13,"And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,"
2 Chronicles,10,14,"King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, ""My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."""
2 Chronicles,10,15,"So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the LORD might fulfill his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, ""What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David."" So all Israel went to their tents."
2 Chronicles,10,17,But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles,10,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam."
2 Chronicles,11,2,But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
2 Chronicles,11,3,"""Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"'Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.'"" So they listened to the word of the LORD and returned and did not go against Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,"Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah."
2 Chronicles,11,6,"He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine."
2 Chronicles,11,12,And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,13,And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the LORD,"
2 Chronicles,11,15,and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the calves that he had made.
2 Chronicles,11,16,"And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse,"
2 Chronicles,11,19,"and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters)."
2 Chronicles,11,22,"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,"And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them."
2 Chronicles,12,1,"When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem"
2 Chronicles,12,3,"with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt--Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians."
2 Chronicles,12,4,And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, ""Thus says the LORD, 'You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.'"""
2 Chronicles,12,6,"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, ""The LORD is righteous."""
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: ""They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak."
2 Chronicles,12,8,"Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."""
2 Chronicles,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. He took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made,"
2 Chronicles,12,10,"and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, conditions were good in Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite."
2 Chronicles,12,14,"And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer? There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,12,16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah went out to battle, having an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. And Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with 800,000 chosen mighty warriors."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, ""Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!"
2 Chronicles,13,5,Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord,"
2 Chronicles,13,7,"and certain worthless scoundrels gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,"""And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes for ordination with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are no gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out the showbread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed."""
2 Chronicles,13,13,"Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come upon them from behind. Thus his troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was in front of and behind them. And they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,13,15,"Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"The men of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand."
2 Chronicles,13,17,"Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men."
2 Chronicles,13,18,"Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down, and he died."
2 Chronicles,13,21,But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles,13,22,"The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years."
2 Chronicles,14,2,And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,14,3,He took away the foreign altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and cut down the Asherim
2 Chronicles,14,4,"and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to keep the law and the commandment."
2 Chronicles,14,5,He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him.
2 Chronicles,14,6,"He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for the LORD gave him peace."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"And he said to Judah, ""Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side."" So they built and prospered."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"And Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, armed with large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin that carried shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor."
2 Chronicles,14,9,"Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and came as far as Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"And Asa cried to the LORD his God, ""O LORD, there is none like you to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you."""
2 Chronicles,14,12,"So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive, for they were broken before the LORD and his army. The men of Judah carried away very much spoil."
2 Chronicles,14,14,"And they attacked all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD was upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them."
2 Chronicles,14,15,And they struck down the tents of those who had livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,15,1,"The Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded,"
2 Chronicles,15,2,"and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, ""Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law,"
2 Chronicles,15,4,"but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"They were broken in pieces. Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded."""
2 Chronicles,15,8,"As soon as Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded, he took courage and put away the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles,15,11,"They sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the spoil that they had brought 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep."
2 Chronicles,15,12,"And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul,"
2 Chronicles,15,13,"but that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman."
2 Chronicles,15,14,They swore an oath to the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.
2 Chronicles,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"Even Maacah, his mother, King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made a detestable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true all his days."
2 Chronicles,15,18,"And he brought into the house of God the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels."
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king's house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"""There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me."""
2 Chronicles,16,4,"And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, ""Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars."""
2 Chronicles,16,10,"Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time."
2 Chronicles,16,11,"The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians."
2 Chronicles,16,13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign."
2 Chronicles,16,14,"They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer's art, and they made a very great fire in his honor."
2 Chronicles,17,1,Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,"He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured."
2 Chronicles,17,3,"The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,"
2 Chronicles,17,4,"but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel."
2 Chronicles,17,5,"Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor."
2 Chronicles,17,6,"His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. And furthermore, he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,7,"In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;"
2 Chronicles,17,8,"and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"And they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,"And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats."
2 Chronicles,17,12,"And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities,"
2 Chronicles,17,13,"and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,17,14,"This was the muster of them by fathers' houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor;"
2 Chronicles,17,15,"and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;"

2 Chronicles,17,19,"These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor, and he made a marriage alliance with Ahab."
2 Chronicles,18,2,"After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead."
2 Chronicles,18,3,"Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, ""Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?"" He answered him, ""I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war."""
2 Chronicles,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, ""Inquire first for the word of the LORD."""
2 Chronicles,18,5,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, ""Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?"" And they said, ""Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king."""
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, ""Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?"""
2 Chronicles,18,7,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ""There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil."" And Jehoshaphat said, ""Let not the king say so."""
2 Chronicles,18,8,"Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, ""Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah."""
2 Chronicles,18,9,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them."

2 Chronicles,22,7,"But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there, he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab."

2 Chronicles,23,14,"Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, ""Bring her out between the ranks, and anyone who follows her is to be put to death with the sword."" For the priest said, ""Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD."""

2 Chronicles,24,5,"And he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, ""Go out to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you act quickly."" But the Levites did not act quickly."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and said to him, ""Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the congregation of Israel for the tent of testimony?"""
2 Chronicles,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also used all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD for the Baals."
2 Chronicles,24,8,"So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,9,And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles,24,10,And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished.
2 Chronicles,24,11,"And whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was much money in it, the king's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place.

2 Chronicles,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the LORD, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD."

2 Chronicles,24,16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house."
2 Chronicles,24,17,Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them.
2 Chronicles,24,18,"And they abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs."

2 Chronicles,24,23,At the end of the year the army of the Syrians came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.

2 Chronicles,25,4,"But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, ""Fathers shall not die because of their children, nor children die because of their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin."""
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers' houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were 300,000 choice men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield."
2 Chronicles,25,6,"He hired also 100,000 mighty men of valor from Israel for 100 talents of silver."
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But a man of God came to him and said, ""O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these Ephraimites."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But go, act, be strong for the battle. Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy? For God has power to help or to cast down."""
2 Chronicles,25,9,"And Amaziah said to the man of God, ""But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?"" The man of God answered, ""The LORD is able to give you much more than this."""
2 Chronicles,25,10,Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger.
2 Chronicles,25,11,"But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 men of Seir."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"The men of Judah captured another 10,000 alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock, and they were all dashed to pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 people in them and took much spoil."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them, making offerings to them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, ""Why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand?"""
2 Chronicles,25,16,"But as he was speaking, the king said to him, ""Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?"" So the prophet stopped, but said, ""I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."""
2 Chronicles,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, ""Come, let us look one another in the face."""
2 Chronicles,25,18,"And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, ""A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife,' and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"You say, 'See, I have struck down Edom,' and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"""
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,22,"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home."
2 Chronicles,25,23,"And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for 400 cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, in the care of Obed-edom. He seized also the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,"Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,25,26,"Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?"
2 Chronicles,25,27,"From the time when he turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,"And they brought him upon horses, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David."
2 Chronicles,26,1,"And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah."
2 Chronicles,26,2,"He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers."

2 Chronicles,26,5,"He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines."
2 Chronicles,26,7,God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites.
2 Chronicles,26,8,"The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong."
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"And he built towers in the wilderness and cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders."
2 Chronicles,26,12,"The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600."
2 Chronicles,26,13,"Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy."

2 Chronicles,26,15,"In Jerusalem he made engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,17,"But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor,"
2 Chronicles,26,18,"and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, ""It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God."""
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him."
2 Chronicles,26,21,"And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king's household, governing the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, ""He is a leper."" And Jotham his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah had done, except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still followed corrupt practices."
2 Chronicles,27,3,He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD and did much building on the wall of Ophel.
2 Chronicles,27,4,"Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills."
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents of silver, and 10,000 cors of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years."
2 Chronicles,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done,"
2 Chronicles,28,2,"but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made metal images for the Baals,"
2 Chronicles,28,3,"and he made offerings in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,4,And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
2 Chronicles,28,5,"Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force."
2 Chronicles,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 from Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"The men of Israel took captive 200,000 of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters. They also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded, and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, ""Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have killed them in a rage that has reached up to heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,"And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God?"
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Now hear me, and send back the captives from your relatives whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."""
2 Chronicles,28,12,"Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war"
2 Chronicles,28,13,"and said to them, ""You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."""
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them. They clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them, and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
2 Chronicles,28,17,For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried away captives.
2 Chronicles,28,18,"And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah act sinfully and had been very unfaithful to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,20,So Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
2 Chronicles,28,21,"For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him."
2 Chronicles,28,22,In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD--this same King Ahaz.
2 Chronicles,28,23,"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, ""Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me."" But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,24,"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"In every city of Judah he made high places to make offerings to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east
2 Chronicles,29,5,"and said to them, ""Hear me, Levites! Now consecrate yourselves, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth from the Holy Place."
2 Chronicles,29,6,For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD and turned their backs.
2 Chronicles,29,7,They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of the LORD came on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes."
2 Chronicles,29,9,"For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this."
2 Chronicles,29,10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, do not now be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him."""
2 Chronicles,29,12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;"
2 Chronicles,29,13,"and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;"
2 Chronicles,29,14,"and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel."
2 Chronicles,29,15,"They gathered their brothers and consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,16,"The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it and carried it out to the brook Kidron."
2 Chronicles,29,17,"They began to consecrate on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD. Then for eight days they consecrated the house of the LORD, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, ""We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the showbread and all its utensils."
2 Chronicles,29,19,"All the utensils that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and consecrated, and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD."""
2 Chronicles,29,20,Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,29,21,"And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and threw it against the altar. And they slaughtered the rams and their blood was thrown against the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs and their blood was thrown against the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,"Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them,"
2 Chronicles,29,24,"and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king's seer and of Nathan the prophet, for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD began also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,30,"And Hezekiah the king and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah said, ""You have now consecrated yourselves to the LORD. Come near; bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD."" And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,33,"And the consecrated offerings were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep."
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so until other priests had consecrated themselves, their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was finished--for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"Besides the great number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had prepared for the people, for the thing came about suddenly."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,2,For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month--
2 Chronicles,30,3,"for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem--"
2 Chronicles,30,4,and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it as often as prescribed."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, ""O people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were faithless to the LORD God of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as you see."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD and come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your children will find compassion with their captors and return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him."""
2 Chronicles,30,10,"So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"However, some men of Asher, of Manasseh, and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,12,The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,30,13,"And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very great assembly."
2 Chronicles,30,14,"They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the Kidron valley."
2 Chronicles,30,15,"And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, so that they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,16,They took their accustomed posts according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests threw the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.
2 Chronicles,30,17,"For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate it to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"For a majority of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, ""May the good LORD pardon everyone"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanness."""
2 Chronicles,30,20,And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,"And the people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with all their might to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the LORD. So they ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,30,23,Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days. So they kept it for another seven days with gladness.
2 Chronicles,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. And the priests consecrated themselves in great numbers."
2 Chronicles,30,25,"The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who lived in Judah, rejoiced."
2 Chronicles,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,27,"Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the Asherim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of the LORD and to give thanks and praise."

2 Chronicles,31,4,"And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the Law of the LORD."

2 Chronicles,31,6,"And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things that had been dedicated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps."
2 Chronicles,31,7,"In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,31,9,And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"Azariah the chief priest, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, ""Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed his people, so that we have this large amount left."""

2 Chronicles,31,12,"And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shimei his brother as second,"
2 Chronicles,31,13,"while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God."

Ezra,2,69,"According to their ability they gave to the treasury of the work 61,000 darics of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priests' garments."
Ezra,2,70,"Now the priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all the rest of Israel in their towns."
Ezra,3,1,"When the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"Then arose Jeshua the son of Jozadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel with his kinsmen, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God."
Ezra,3,3,"They set the altar in its place, for fear was on them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening."
Ezra,3,4,"And they kept the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the rule, as each day required,"
Ezra,3,5,"and after that the regular burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the appointed feasts of the LORD, and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
Ezra,3,7,"So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus king of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their kinsmen, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to supervise the work of the house of the LORD."
Ezra,3,9,"And Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together supervised the workmen in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad and the Levites, their sons and brothers."
Ezra,3,10,"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments came forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the directions of David king of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, ""For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel.""And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy,"
Ezra,3,13,"so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard far away."
Ezra,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel,"
Ezra,4,2,"they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' houses and said to them, ""Let us build with you, for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria who brought us here."""
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses in Israel said to them, ""You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us."""
Ezra,4,4,Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build
Ezra,4,5,"and bribed counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,4,6,"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam and Mithredath and Tabeel and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated."
Ezra,4,8,Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
Ezra,4,9,"Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,"
Ezra,4,10,and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River.
Ezra,4,11,"(This is a copy of the letter that they sent.) ""To Artaxerxes the king: Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, send greeting. And now"
Ezra,4,12,be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
Ezra,4,13,"Now be it known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be impaired."
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to witness the king's dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king,"
Ezra,4,15,"in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste."
Ezra,4,16,"We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River."""
Ezra,4,17,"The king sent an answer: ""To Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting. And now"
Ezra,4,18,the letter that you sent to us has been plainly read before me.
Ezra,4,19,"And I made a decree, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city from of old has risen against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it."
Ezra,4,20,"And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, custom, and toll were paid."
Ezra,4,21,"Therefore make a decree that these men be made to cease, and that this city be not rebuilt, until a decree is made by me."
Ezra,4,22,"And take care not to be slack in this matter. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the king?"""
Ezra,4,23,"Then, when the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their associates, they went in haste to the Jews at Jerusalem and by force and power made them cease."
Ezra,4,24,"Then the work on the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,5,1,"Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them."
Ezra,5,2,"Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, supporting them."
Ezra,5,3,"At the same time Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus, ""Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?"""
Ezra,5,4,"They also asked them this: ""What are the names of the men who are building this building?"""
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report should reach Darius and then an answer be returned by letter concerning it."
Ezra,5,6,This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the governors who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king.
Ezra,5,7,"They sent him a report, in which was written as follows: ""To Darius the king, all peace."
Ezra,5,8,"Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands."
Ezra,5,9,"Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus, 'Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?'"
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of their leaders."
Ezra,5,11,"And this was their reply to us: 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished."
Ezra,5,12,"But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia."
Ezra,5,13,"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt."
Ezra,5,14,"And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;"
Ezra,5,15,"and he said to him, ""Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site."""
Ezra,5,16,"Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is not yet finished.'"
Ezra,5,17,"Therefore, if it seems good to the king, let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter."""
Ezra,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in Babylonia, in the house of the archives where the documents were stored."
Ezra,6,2,"And in Ecbatana, the capital that is in the province of Media, a scroll was found on which this was written: ""A record."
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king issued a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where sacrifices were offered, and let its foundations be retained. Its height shall be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits,"
Ezra,6,4,with three layers of great stones and one layer of timber. Let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
Ezra,6,5,"And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple that is in Jerusalem, each to its place. You shall put them in the house of God."
Ezra,6,6,"""Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates the governors who are in the province Beyond the River, keep away."
Ezra,6,7,Let the work on this house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover, I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God. The cost is to be paid to these men in full and without delay from the royal revenue, the tribute of the province from Beyond the River."
Ezra,6,9,"And whatever is needed--bulls, rams, or sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, as the priests at Jerusalem require--let that be given to them day by day without fail,"
Ezra,6,10,that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra,6,11,"Also I make a decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of his house, and he shall be impaled on it, and his house shall be made a dunghill."
Ezra,6,12,"May the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who shall put out a hand to alter this, or to destroy this house of God that is in Jerusalem. I Darius make a decree; let it be done with all diligence."""
Ezra,6,13,"Then, according to the word sent by Darius the king, Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what Darius the king had ordered."
Ezra,6,14,And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They finished their building by decree of the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia;
Ezra,6,15,"and this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
Ezra,6,16,"And the people of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"They offered at the dedication of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God at Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,"On the fourteenth day of the first month, the returned exiles kept the Passover."
Ezra,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"It was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile, and also by everyone who had joined them and separated himself from the uncleanness of the peoples of the land to worship the LORD, the God of Israel."
Ezra,6,22,"And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, so that he aided them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"Now after this, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,"
Ezra,7,2,"son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,"
Ezra,7,3,"son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,"
Ezra,7,4,"son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,"
Ezra,7,5,"son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest--"
Ezra,7,6,"this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses that the LORD the God of Israel had given, and the king granted him all that he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him."
Ezra,7,7,"And there went up also to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king, some of the people of Israel, and some of the priests and Levites, the singers and gatekeepers, and the temple servants."
Ezra,7,8,"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a man learned in matters of the commandments of the LORD and his statutes for Israel:"
Ezra,7,12,"""Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven. Peace. And now"
Ezra,7,13,"I make a decree that anyone of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom, who freely offers to go to Jerusalem, may go with you."
Ezra,7,14,"For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to make inquiries about Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your hand,"
Ezra,7,15,"and also to carry the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,16,"with all the silver and gold that you shall find in the whole province of Babylonia, and with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, vowed willingly for the house of their God that is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,17,"With this money, then, you shall with all diligence buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God that is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"Whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do, according to the will of your God."
Ezra,7,19,"The vessels that have been given you for the service of the house of your God, you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,20,"And whatever else is required for the house of your God, which it falls to you to provide, you may provide it out of the king's treasury."
Ezra,7,21,"""And I, Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers in the province Beyond the River: Whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, requires of you, let it be done with all diligence,"
Ezra,7,22,"up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatever is decreed by the God of heaven, let it be done in full for the house of the God of heaven, lest his wrath be against the realm of the king and his sons."
Ezra,7,24,"We also notify you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll on anyone of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, or other servants of this house of God."
Ezra,7,25,"""And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people in the province Beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God. And those who do not know them, you shall teach."
Ezra,7,26,"Whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be strictly executed on him, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of his goods or for imprisonment."""
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who put such a thing as this into the heart of the king, to beautify the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,28,"and who extended to me his steadfast love before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty officers. I took courage, for the hand of the LORD my God was on me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,"These are the heads of their fathers' houses, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:"
Ezra,8,2,"Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush."
Ezra,8,3,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, who was of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, with whom were registered 150 men."
Ezra,8,4,"Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men."

Ezra,8,6,"Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men."
Ezra,8,7,"Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men."
Ezra,8,8,"Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him 80 men."
Ezra,8,9,"Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men."
Ezra,8,10,"Of the sons of Bani, Shelomith the son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men."
Ezra,8,11,"Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah, the son of Bebai, and with him 28 men."
Ezra,8,12,"Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men."
Ezra,8,13,"Of the sons of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men."
Ezra,8,14,"Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men."
Ezra,8,15,"I gathered them to the river that runs to Ahava, and there we camped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the sons of Levi."
Ezra,8,16,"Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of insight,"
Ezra,8,17,"and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers and the temple servants at the place Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,18,"And by the good hand of our God on us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, 18;"
Ezra,8,19,"also Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his kinsmen and their sons, 20;"
Ezra,8,20,"besides 220 of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our goods."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king, ""The hand of our God is for good on all who seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him."""
Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and implored our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty."
Ezra,8,24,"Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them."
Ezra,8,25,"And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered."
Ezra,8,26,"I weighed out into their hand 650 talents of silver, and silver vessels worth 200 talents, and 100 talents of gold,"
Ezra,8,27,"20 bowls of gold worth 1,000 darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"And I said to them, ""You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers."
Ezra,8,29,"Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD."""
Ezra,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way."
Ezra,8,32,"We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days."
Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui."
Ezra,8,34,"The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded."
Ezra,8,35,"At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezra,8,36,"They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and they aided the people and the house of God."
Ezra,9,1,"After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, ""The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost."""
Ezra,9,3,"As soon as I heard this, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled."
Ezra,9,4,"Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice."
Ezra,9,5,"And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garment and my cloak torn, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,"
Ezra,9,6,"saying:""O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as it is today."
Ezra,9,8,"But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a secure hold within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery."
Ezra,9,9,"For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection in Judea and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"""And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,"
Ezra,9,11,"which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land that you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness."
Ezra,9,12,"Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.'"
Ezra,9,13,"And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant as this,"
Ezra,9,14,"shall we break your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would you not be angry with us until you consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?"
Ezra,9,15,"O LORD the God of Israel, you are just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this."""
Ezra,10,1,"While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel, for the people wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: ""We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this."
Ezra,10,3,"Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it."""
Ezra,10,5,Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib, where he spent the night, neither eating bread nor drinking water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles."
Ezra,10,7,"And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,"
Ezra,10,8,"and that if anyone did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles."
Ezra,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain."
Ezra,10,10,"And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, ""You have broken faith and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel."
Ezra,10,11,"Now then make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."""
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, ""It is so; we must do as you have said."
Ezra,10,13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Let our officials stand for the whole assembly. Let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us."""
Ezra,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them."
Ezra,10,16,"Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, heads of fathers' houses, according to their fathers' houses, each of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter;"
Ezra,10,17,and by the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezra,10,18,"Now there were found some of the sons of the priests who had married foreign women: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah, some of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers."
Ezra,10,19,"They pledged themselves to put away their wives, and their guilt offering was a ram of the flock for their guilt."

Ezra,10,44,"All these had married foreign women, and some of the women had even borne children."
Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,3,"And they said to me, ""The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire."""
Nehemiah,1,4,"As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"And I said, ""O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father's house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples,"
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.'"
Nehemiah,1,10,"They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand."
Nehemiah,1,11,"O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.""Now I was cupbearer to the king."
Nehemiah,2,1,"In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence."
Nehemiah,2,2,"And the king said to me, ""Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart."" Then I was very much afraid."
Nehemiah,2,3,"I said to the king, ""Let the king live forever! Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' graves, lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"""
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king said to me, ""What are you requesting?"" So I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"And I said to the king, ""If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' graves, that I may rebuild it."""
Nehemiah,2,6,"And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), ""How long will you be gone, and when will you return?"" So it pleased the king to send me when I had given him a time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"And I said to the king, ""If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah,"
Nehemiah,2,8,"and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy."" And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me."
Nehemiah,2,9,Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah,2,10,"But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah, the Ammonite servant, heard this, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,"Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode."
Nehemiah,2,13,"I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass."
Nehemiah,2,15,"Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned."
Nehemiah,2,16,"And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest who were to do the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then I said to them, ""You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer derision."""
Nehemiah,2,18,"And I told them of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good, and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, ""Let us rise up and build."" So they strengthened their hands for the good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they jeered at us and despised us and said, ""What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"""
Nehemiah,2,20,"Then I replied to them, ""The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or claim in Jerusalem."""
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set its doors. They consecrated it as far as the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Tower of Hananel."
Nehemiah,3,2,And next to him the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.

Nehemiah,3,26,and the temple servants living on Ophel repaired to a point opposite the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower.

Nehemiah,3,29,"After them Zadok the son of Immer repaired opposite his own house. After him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, repaired."

Nehemiah,3,31,"After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, opposite the Muster Gate, and to the upper chamber of the corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,And between the upper chamber of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants repaired.
Nehemiah,4,1,"Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he jeered at the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"And he said in the presence of his brothers and of the army of Samaria, ""What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?"""
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, ""Yes, what they are building--if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!"""
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight, for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we built the wall. And all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
Nehemiah,4,9,And we prayed to our God and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.
Nehemiah,4,10,"In Judah it was said, ""The strength of those who bear the burdens is failing. There is too much rubble. By ourselves we will not be able to rebuild the wall."""
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our enemies said, ""They will not know or see till we come among them and kill them and stop the work."""
Nehemiah,4,12,"At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and said to us ten times, ""You must return to us."""
Nehemiah,4,13,"So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people by their clans, with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"And I looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, ""Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes."""
Nehemiah,4,15,"When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah,"
Nehemiah,4,17,who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other.
Nehemiah,4,18,And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, ""The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us."""
Nehemiah,4,21,"So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out."
Nehemiah,4,22,"I also said to the people at that time, ""Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day."""
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon at his right hand."
Nehemiah,5,1,Now there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were those who said, ""With our sons and our daughters, we are many. So let us get grain, that we may eat and keep alive."""
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were also those who said, ""We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine."""
Nehemiah,5,4,"And there were those who said, ""We have borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children are as their children. Yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but it is not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards."""
Nehemiah,5,6,I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"I took counsel with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials. I said to them, ""You are exacting interest, each from his brother."" And I held a great assembly against them"
Nehemiah,5,8,"and said to them, ""We, as far as we are able, have bought back our Jewish brothers who have been sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us!"" They were silent and could not find a word to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"So I said, ""The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"Moreover, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us abandon this exacting of interest."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the percentage of money, grain, wine, and oil that you have been exacting from them."""
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then they said, ""We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say."" And I called the priests and made them swear to do as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook out the fold of my garment and said, ""So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not keep this promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied."" And all the assembly said ""Amen"" and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor."
Nehemiah,5,15,"The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them for their daily ration forty shekels of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God."
Nehemiah,5,16,"I also persevered in the work on this wall, and we acquired no land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover, there were at my table 150 men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now what was prepared at my expense for each day was one ox and six choice sheep and birds, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the service was too heavy on this people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),"
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, ""Come and let us meet together at Hakkephirim in the plain of Ono."" But they intended to do me harm."
Nehemiah,6,3,"And I sent messengers to them, saying, ""I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"""
Nehemiah,6,4,"And they sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same manner."
Nehemiah,6,5,In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
Nehemiah,6,6,"In it was written, ""It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall. And according to these reports you wish to become their king."
Nehemiah,6,7,"And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, 'There is a king in Judah.' And now the king will hear of these reports. So now come and let us take counsel together."""
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent to him, saying, ""No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind."""

Nehemiah,6,10,"Now when I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home, he said, ""Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple. Let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you by night."""

Nehemiah,6,17,"Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them."

Nehemiah,6,19,Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid.

Nehemiah,7,2,"I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the governor of the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many."

Nehemiah,7,4,"The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few, and no houses had been rebuilt."

Nehemiah,9,17,"They refused to obey and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed among them, but they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Even when they had made for themselves a golden calf and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and had committed great blasphemies,"
Nehemiah,9,19,"you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them in the way did not depart from them by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to light for them the way by which they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,You gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst.
Nehemiah,9,21,"Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell."

Nehemiah,9,25,"And they captured fortified cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all good things, cisterns already hewn, vineyards, olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"""Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. And in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies."
Nehemiah,9,29,"And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, which if a person does them, he shall live by them, and turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey."
Nehemiah,9,30,Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"""Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"Even in their own kingdom, enjoying your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves."
Nehemiah,9,37,"And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress."

Nehemiah,11,22,"The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the work of the house of God."
Nehemiah,11,23,"For there was a command from the king concerning them, and a fixed provision for the singers, as every day required."
Nehemiah,11,24,"And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's side in all matters concerning the people."
Nehemiah,11,25,"And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its villages, and in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,"
Nehemiah,11,26,"and in Jeshua and in Moladah and Beth-pelet,"
Nehemiah,11,27,"in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its villages,"
Nehemiah,11,28,"in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages,"
Nehemiah,11,29,"in En-rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,"
Nehemiah,11,30,"Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its villages. So they encamped from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom."
Nehemiah,11,31,"The people of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its villages,"
Nehemiah,11,32,"Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,"
Nehemiah,11,33,"Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,"
Nehemiah,11,34,"Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,"
Nehemiah,11,35,"Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen."
Nehemiah,11,36,And certain divisions of the Levites in Judah were assigned to Benjamin.
Nehemiah,12,1,"These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,"
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,"
Nehemiah,12,3,"Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,"
Nehemiah,12,4,"Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,"

Nehemiah,12,6,"Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua."
Nehemiah,12,8,"And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his brothers was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving."
Nehemiah,12,9,And Bakbukiah and Unni and their brothers stood opposite them in the service.
Nehemiah,12,10,"And Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib the father of Joiada,"
Nehemiah,12,11,"Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddua."
Nehemiah,12,12,"And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers' houses: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;"
Nehemiah,12,13,"of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;"
Nehemiah,12,14,"of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;"
Nehemiah,12,15,"of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;"

Nehemiah,12,20,"of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;"
Nehemiah,12,21,"of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel."
Nehemiah,12,22,"In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the Levites were recorded as heads of fathers' houses; so too were the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian."
Nehemiah,12,23,"As for the sons of Levi, their heads of fathers' houses were written in the Book of the Chronicles until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib."
Nehemiah,12,24,"And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers who stood opposite them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch by watch."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storehouses of the gates."
Nehemiah,12,26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra, the priest and scribe."
Nehemiah,12,27,"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres."
Nehemiah,12,28,And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;
Nehemiah,12,29,"also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,12,30,"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people and the gates and the wall."
Nehemiah,12,31,Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two great choirs that gave thanks. One went to the south on the wall to the Dung Gate.
Nehemiah,12,32,"And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,"
Nehemiah,12,33,"and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,"
Nehemiah,12,34,"Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah,12,35,"and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph;"
Nehemiah,12,36,"and his relatives, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them."
Nehemiah,12,37,"At the Fountain Gate they went up straight before them by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east."
Nehemiah,12,38,"The other choir of those who gave thanks went to the north, and I followed them with half of the people, on the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the Broad Wall,"
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Gate of Yeshanah, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard."
Nehemiah,12,40,"So both choirs of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I and half of the officials with me;"
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader."
Nehemiah,12,43,"And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away."
Nehemiah,12,44,"On that day men were appointed over the storerooms, the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the Law for the priests and for the Levites according to the fields of the towns, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered."
Nehemiah,12,45,"And they performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For long ago in the days of David and Asaph there were directors of the singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people. And in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"for they did not meet the people of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them--yet our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"As soon as the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those of foreign descent."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was related to Tobiah,"
Nehemiah,13,5,"prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"While this was taking place, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. And after some time I asked leave of the king"
Nehemiah,13,7,"and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God."
Nehemiah,13,8,"And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber."
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I gave orders, and they cleansed the chambers, and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each to his field."
Nehemiah,13,11,"So I confronted the officials and said, ""Why is the house of God forsaken?"" And I gathered them together and set them in their stations."
Nehemiah,13,12,"Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses."
Nehemiah,13,13,"And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered reliable, and their duty was to distribute to their brothers."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them on the day when they sold food."
Nehemiah,13,16,"Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, in Jerusalem itself!"
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, ""What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath."""
Nehemiah,13,19,"As soon as it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah,13,21,"But I warned them and said to them, ""Why do you lodge outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you."" From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"Then I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,"And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but the language of each people."
Nehemiah,13,25,"And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair. And I made them take oath in the name of God, saying, ""You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,"Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"""
Nehemiah,13,28,"And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have desecrated the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;"
Nehemiah,13,31,"and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times, and for the firstfruits.Remember me, O my God, for good."
Esther,1,1,"Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces,"
Esther,1,2,"in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa, the capital,"
Esther,1,3,"in the third year of his reign he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,"
Esther,1,4,"while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness for many days, 180 days."
Esther,1,5,"And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa, the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace."
Esther,1,6,"There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones."
Esther,1,7,"Drinks were served in golden vessels, vessels of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king."
Esther,1,8,"And drinking was according to this edict: ""There is no compulsion."" For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired."
Esther,1,9,Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,"
Esther,1,11,"to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty, for she was lovely to look at."
Esther,1,12,"But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs. At this the king became enraged, and his anger burned within him."
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment,"
Esther,1,14,"the men next to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom):"
Esther,1,15,"""According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?"""
Esther,1,16,"Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, ""Not only against the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also against all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus."
Esther,1,17,"For the queen's behavior will be made known to all women, causing them to look at their husbands with contempt, since they will say, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.'"
Esther,1,18,"This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will say the same to all the king's officials, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty."
Esther,1,19,"If it please the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be repealed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she."
Esther,1,20,"So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, for it is vast, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike."""
Esther,1,21,"This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed."
Esther,1,22,"He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be master in his own household and speak according to the language of his people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her."
Esther,2,2,"Then the king's young men who attended him said, ""Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king."
Esther,2,3,"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the capital, under custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women. Let their cosmetics be given them."
Esther,2,4,"And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti."" This pleased the king, and he did so."
Esther,2,5,"Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,"
Esther,2,6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away."
Esther,2,7,"He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women."
Esther,2,9,"And the young woman pleased him and won his favor. And he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king's palace, and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem."
Esther,2,10,"Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known."
Esther,2,11,And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.
Esther,2,12,"Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women--"
Esther,2,13,"when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace."
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name."
Esther,2,15,"When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her."
Esther,2,16,"And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,"
Esther,2,17,"the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther,2,18,Then the king gave a great feast for all his officials and servants; it was Esther's feast. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.
Esther,2,19,"Now when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him."
Esther,2,21,"In those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai."
Esther,2,23,"When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him."
Esther,3,2,"And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage."
Esther,3,3,"Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, ""Why do you transgress the king's command?"""
Esther,3,4,"And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury."
Esther,3,6,"But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, ""There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not to the king's profit to tolerate them."
Esther,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries."""
Esther,3,10,"So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews."
Esther,3,11,"And the king said to Haman, ""The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."""
Esther,3,12,"Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring."
Esther,3,13,"Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods."
Esther,3,14,A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.
Esther,3,15,"The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry."
Esther,4,2,"He went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth."
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"When Esther's young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them."
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was."
Esther,4,6,"Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,"
Esther,4,7,"and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews."
Esther,4,8,"Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people."
Esther,4,9,And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say,"
Esther,4,11,"""All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law--to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."""
Esther,4,12,And they told Mordecai what Esther had said.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, ""Do not think to yourself that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews."
Esther,4,14,"For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"""
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,"
Esther,4,16,"""Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish."""
Esther,4,17,Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
Esther,5,1,"On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, in front of the king's quarters, while the king was sitting on his royal throne inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace."
Esther,5,2,"And when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"And the king said to her, ""What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom."""
Esther,5,4,"And Esther said, ""If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king."""
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, ""Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked."" So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, ""What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."""
Esther,5,7,"Then Esther answered, ""My wish and my request is:"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said."""
Esther,5,9,"And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh."
Esther,5,11,"And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king."
Esther,5,12,"Then Haman said, ""Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king."
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."""
Esther,5,14,"Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, ""Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast."" This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made."
Esther,6,1,"On that night the king could not sleep. And he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king."
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus."
Esther,6,3,"And the king said, ""What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?"" The king's young men who attended him said, ""Nothing has been done for him."""
Esther,6,4,"And the king said, ""Who is in the court?"" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,5,"And the king's young men told him, ""Haman is there, standing in the court."" And the king said, ""Let him come in."""
Esther,6,6,"So Haman came in, and the king said to him, ""What should be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?"" And Haman said to himself, ""Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?"""
Esther,6,7,"And Haman said to the king, ""For the man whom the king delights to honor,"
Esther,6,8,"let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set."
Esther,6,9,"And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city, proclaiming before him: 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.'"""
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, ""Hurry; take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned."""
Esther,6,11,"So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, ""Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor."""
Esther,6,12,"Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered."
Esther,6,13,"And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, ""If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him."""
Esther,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the feast that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.
Esther,7,2,"And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, ""What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."""
Esther,7,3,"Then Queen Esther answered, ""If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request."
Esther,7,4,"For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king."""
Esther,7,5,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, ""Who is he, and where is he, who has dared to do this?"""
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said, ""A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!"" Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen."
Esther,7,7,"And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king."
Esther,7,8,"And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, ""Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?"" As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face."
Esther,7,9,"Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, ""Moreover, the gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman's house, fifty cubits high."""
Esther,7,10,"And the king said, ""Hang him on that."" So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king abated."
Esther,8,1,"On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her."
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews.
Esther,8,4,"When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther,"
Esther,8,5,"Esther rose and stood before the king. And she said, ""If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king."
Esther,8,6,"For how can I bear to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?"""
Esther,8,7,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, ""Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he intended to lay hands on the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king's ring, for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked."""
Esther,8,9,"The king's scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. And an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language."
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud,"
Esther,8,11,"saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, children and women included, and to plunder their goods,"
Esther,8,12,"on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar."
Esther,8,13,"A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, being publicly displayed to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies."
Esther,8,14,"So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out hurriedly, urged by the king's command. And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel."
Esther,8,15,"Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a robe of fine linen and purple, and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced."
Esther,8,16,The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor.
Esther,8,17,"And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and edict were about to be carried out, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, the reverse occurred: the Jews gained mastery over those who hated them."
Esther,9,2,"The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen on all peoples."
Esther,9,3,"All the officials of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal agents also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them."
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful."
Esther,9,5,"The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them."
Esther,9,6,"In Susa the citadel itself the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men,"
Esther,9,7,and also killed Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha
Esther,9,8,and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha
Esther,9,9,"and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vaizatha,"
Esther,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they laid no hand on the plunder."
Esther,9,11,That very day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said to Queen Esther, ""In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled."""
Esther,9,13,"And Esther said, ""If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows."""
Esther,9,14,"So the king commanded this to be done. A decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged."
Esther,9,15,"The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed 300 men in Susa, but they laid no hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,16,"Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they laid no hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,17,"This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the rural towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,"
Esther,9,21,"obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,"
Esther,9,22,"as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"So the Jews accepted what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them."
Esther,9,24,"For Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is, cast lots), to crush and to destroy them."
Esther,9,25,"But when it came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his evil plan that he had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,"Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. Therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had happened to them,"
Esther,9,27,"the Jews firmly obligated themselves and their offspring and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year,"
Esther,9,28,"that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every clan, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants."
Esther,9,29,"Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim."
Esther,9,30,"Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, in words of peace and truth,"
Esther,9,31,"that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther obligated them, and as they had obligated themselves and their offspring, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting."
Esther,9,32,"The command of Queen Esther confirmed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing."
Esther,10,1,King Ahasuerus imposed tax on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Ahasuerus, and he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brothers, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people."
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil."
Job,1,2,There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,"He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east."
Job,1,4,"His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them."
Job,1,5,"And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, ""It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts."" Thus Job did continually."
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them."
Job,1,7,"The LORD said to Satan, ""From where have you come?"" Satan answered the LORD and said, ""From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."""
Job,1,8,"And the LORD said to Satan, ""Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"""
Job,1,9,"Then Satan answered the LORD and said, ""Does Job fear God for no reason?"
Job,1,10,"Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land."
Job,1,11,"But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."""
Job,1,12,"And the LORD said to Satan, ""Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand."" So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD."
Job,1,13,"Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,"
Job,1,14,"and there came a messenger to Job and said, ""The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,"
Job,1,15,"and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."""
Job,1,16,"While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, ""The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."""
Job,1,17,"While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, ""The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."""
Job,1,18,"While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, ""Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,"
Job,1,19,"and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you."""
Job,1,20,Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.
Job,1,21,"And he said, ""Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."""
Job,1,22,In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD."
Job,2,2,"And the LORD said to Satan, ""From where have you come?"" Satan answered the LORD and said, ""From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."""
Job,2,3,"And the LORD said to Satan, ""Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason."""
Job,2,4,"Then Satan answered the LORD and said, ""Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life."
Job,2,5,"But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."""
Job,2,6,"And the LORD said to Satan, ""Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life."""
Job,2,7,So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
Job,2,8,And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then his wife said to him, ""Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."""
Job,2,10,"But he said to her, ""You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?"" In all this Job did not sin with his lips."
Job,2,11,"Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven."
Job,2,13,"And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great."
Job,3,1,After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job,3,2,And Job said:
Job,3,3,"""Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'"
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,That night--let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
Job,3,7,"Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it."
Job,3,8,"Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,"
Job,3,10,"because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes."
Job,3,11,"""Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?"
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?"
Job,3,13,"For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,"
Job,3,14,"with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,"
Job,3,15,"or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver."
Job,3,16,"Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?"
Job,3,17,"There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest."
Job,3,18,There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
Job,3,19,"The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master."
Job,3,20,"""Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,"
Job,3,21,"who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,"
Job,3,22,who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?
Job,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water."
Job,3,25,"For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me."
Job,3,26,"I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."""
Job,4,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job,4,2,"""If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed."
Job,4,6,"Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?"
Job,4,7,"""Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?"
Job,4,8,"As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken."
Job,4,11,"The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered."
Job,4,12,"""Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it."
Job,4,13,"Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,"
Job,4,14,"dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake."
Job,4,15,A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:"
Job,4,17,'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
Job,4,18,"Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;"
Job,4,19,"how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth."
Job,4,20,Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.
Job,4,21,"Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'"
Job,5,1,"""Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?"
Job,5,2,"Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple."
Job,5,3,"I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling."
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them."
Job,5,5,"The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth."
Job,5,6,"For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,"
Job,5,7,but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
Job,5,8,"""As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause,"
Job,5,9,"who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:"
Job,5,10,he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;
Job,5,11,"he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety."
Job,5,12,"He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success."
Job,5,13,"He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end."
Job,5,14,They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night.
Job,5,15,But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty.
Job,5,16,"So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth."
Job,5,17,"""Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal."
Job,5,19,He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you.
Job,5,20,"In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword."
Job,5,21,"You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes."
Job,5,22,"At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth."
Job,5,23,"For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you."
Job,5,24,"You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing."
Job,5,25,"You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season."
Job,5,27,"Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."""
Job,6,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,6,2,"""Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!"
Job,6,3,For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
Job,6,4,For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
Job,6,5,"Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?"
Job,6,6,"Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?"
Job,6,7,My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.
Job,6,8,"""Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,"
Job,6,9,"that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?"
Job,6,12,"Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?"
Job,6,13,"Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?"
Job,6,14,"""He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty."
Job,6,15,"My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away,"
Job,6,16,"which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself."
Job,6,17,"When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place."
Job,6,18,The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish.
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope."
Job,6,20,They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed.
Job,6,21,For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid.
Job,6,22,"Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?"
Job,6,23,"Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?"
Job,6,24,"""Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray."
Job,6,25,How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove?
Job,6,26,"Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?"
Job,6,27,"You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend."
Job,6,28,"""But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face."
Job,6,29,Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake.
Job,6,30,Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?
Job,7,1,"""Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand?"
Job,7,2,"Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages,"
Job,7,3,"so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh."
Job,7,6,My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope.
Job,7,7,"""Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good."
Job,7,8,"The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone."
Job,7,9,"As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;"
Job,7,10,"he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore."
Job,7,11,"""Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
Job,7,12,"Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'"
Job,7,14,"then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,"
Job,7,15,so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones.
Job,7,16,"I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath."
Job,7,17,"What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him,"
Job,7,18,visit him every morning and test him every moment?
Job,7,19,"How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit?"
Job,7,20,"If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you?"
Job,7,21,"Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."""
Job,8,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job,8,2,"""How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?"
Job,8,3,Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
Job,8,4,"If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression."
Job,8,5,"If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,"
Job,8,6,"if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation."
Job,8,7,"And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great."
Job,8,8,"""For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out."
Job,8,9,"For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow."
Job,8,10,Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?
Job,8,11,"""Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?"
Job,8,12,"While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant."
Job,8,13,Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.
Job,8,14,"His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web."
Job,8,15,"He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure."
Job,8,16,"He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden."
Job,8,17,His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones.
Job,8,18,"If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.'"
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring."
Job,8,20,"""Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers."
Job,8,21,"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting."
Job,8,22,"Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."""
Job,9,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,9,2,"""Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God?"
Job,9,3,"If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times."
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart and mighty in strength--who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?--"
Job,9,5,"he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger,"
Job,9,6,"who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;"
Job,9,7,"who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;"
Job,9,8,who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea;
Job,9,9,"who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;"
Job,9,10,"who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number."
Job,9,11,"Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'"
Job,9,13,"""God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab."
Job,9,14,"How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him?"
Job,9,15,"Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser."
Job,9,16,"If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice."
Job,9,17,For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause;
Job,9,18,"he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?"
Job,9,20,"Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life.
Job,9,22,"It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges--if it is not he, who then is it?"
Job,9,25,"""My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good."
Job,9,26,"They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey."
Job,9,27,"If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,'"
Job,9,28,"I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29,I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain?
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,"
Job,9,31,"yet you will plunge me into a pit, and my own clothes will abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together."
Job,9,33,"There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not dread of him terrify me."
Job,9,35,"Then I would speak without fear of him, for I am not so in myself."
Job,10,1,"""I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
Job,10,2,"I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me."
Job,10,3,"Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees?
Job,10,5,"Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years,"
Job,10,6,"that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin,"
Job,10,7,"although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand?"
Job,10,8,"Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether."
Job,10,9,Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust?
Job,10,10,Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
Job,10,11,"You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,"You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose.
Job,10,14,"If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction."
Job,10,16,"And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me."
Job,10,17,You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me.
Job,10,18,"""Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me"
Job,10,19,"and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave."
Job,10,20,"Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer"
Job,10,21,"before I go--and I shall not return--to the land of darkness and deep shadow,"
Job,10,22,"the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness."""
Job,11,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Job,11,2,"""Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right?"
Job,11,3,"Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?"
Job,11,4,"For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.'"
Job,11,5,"But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you,"
Job,11,6,and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
Job,11,7,"""Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?"
Job,11,8,It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know?
Job,11,9,Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.
Job,11,10,"If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back?"
Job,11,11,"For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?"
Job,11,12,But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man!
Job,11,13,"""If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him."
Job,11,14,"If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents."
Job,11,15,Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear.
Job,11,16,You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
Job,11,17,And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
Job,11,18,"And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security."
Job,11,19,"You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."""
Job,12,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,12,2,"""No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you."
Job,12,3,But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?
Job,12,4,"I am a laughingstock to my friends; I, who called to God and he answered me, a just and blameless man, am a laughingstock."
Job,12,5,In the thought of one who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for those whose feet slip.
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their hand."
Job,12,7,"""But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you;"
Job,12,8,"or the bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you."
Job,12,9,Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
Job,12,10,In his hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind.
Job,12,11,Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food?
Job,12,12,"Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding in length of days."
Job,12,13,"""With God are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding."
Job,12,14,"If he tears down, none can rebuild; if he shuts a man in, none can open."
Job,12,15,"If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land."
Job,12,16,With him are strength and sound wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job,12,17,"He leads counselors away stripped, and judges he makes fools."
Job,12,18,He looses the bonds of kings and binds a waistcloth on their hips.
Job,12,19,He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the mighty.
Job,12,20,He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment of the elders.
Job,12,21,He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong.
Job,12,22,He uncovers the deeps out of darkness and brings deep darkness to light.
Job,12,23,"He makes nations great, and he destroys them; he enlarges nations, and leads them away."
Job,12,24,He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and makes them wander in a pathless waste.
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them stagger like a drunken man."
Job,13,1,"""Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you."
Job,13,3,"But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God."
Job,13,4,"As for you, you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all."
Job,13,5,"Oh that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom!"
Job,13,6,Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Job,13,7,Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him?
Job,13,8,Will you show partiality toward him? Will you plead the case for God?
Job,13,9,"Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man?"
Job,13,10,He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality.
Job,13,11,"Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you?"
Job,13,12,Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
Job,13,13,"""Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may."
Job,13,14,Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand?
Job,13,15,"Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face."
Job,13,16,"This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him."
Job,13,17,"Keep listening to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears."
Job,13,18,"Behold, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be in the right."
Job,13,19,Who is there who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
Job,13,20,"Only grant me two things, then I will not hide myself from your face:"
Job,13,21,"withdraw your hand far from me, and let not dread of you terrify me."
Job,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me."
Job,13,23,How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy?
Job,13,25,Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff?
Job,13,26,For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
Job,13,27,You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths; you set a limit for the soles of my feet.
Job,13,28,"Man wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,"""Man who is born of a woman is few of days and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,He comes out like a flower and withers; he flees like a shadow and continues not.
Job,14,3,And do you open your eyes on such a one and bring me into judgment with you?
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? There is not one.
Job,14,5,"Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass,"
Job,14,6,"look away from him and leave him alone, that he may enjoy, like a hired hand, his day."
Job,14,7,"""For there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the soil,"
Job,14,9,yet at the scent of water it will bud and put out branches like a young plant.
Job,14,10,"But a man dies and is laid low; man breathes his last, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As waters fail from a lake and a river wastes away and dries up,"
Job,14,12,so a man lies down and rises not again; till the heavens are no more he will not awake or be roused out of his sleep.
Job,14,13,"Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath be past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my renewal should come."
Job,14,15,"You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands."
Job,14,16,For then you would number my steps; you would not keep watch over my sin;
Job,14,17,"my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity."
Job,14,18,"""But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place;"
Job,14,19,the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"You prevail forever against him, and he passes; you change his countenance, and send him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he perceives it not."
Job,14,22,"He feels only the pain of his own body, and he mourns only for himself."""
Job,15,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job,15,2,"""Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,"Should he argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which he can do no good?"
Job,15,4,But you are doing away with the fear of God and hindering meditation before God.
Job,15,5,"For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,7,"""Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?"
Job,15,8,Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
Job,15,10,"Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older than your father."
Job,15,11,"Are the comforts of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you?"
Job,15,12,"Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,"
Job,15,13,that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth?
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight;"
Job,15,16,"how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water!"
Job,15,17,"""I will show you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare"
Job,15,18,"(what wise men have told, without hiding it from their fathers,"
Job,15,19,"to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them)."
Job,15,20,"The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless."
Job,15,21,Dreadful sounds are in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon him.
Job,15,22,"He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, and he is marked for the sword."
Job,15,23,"He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand;"
Job,15,24,"distress and anguish terrify him; they prevail against him, like a king ready for battle."
Job,15,25,"Because he has stretched out his hand against God and defies the Almighty,"
Job,15,26,running stubbornly against him with a thickly bossed shield;
Job,15,27,because he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his waist
Job,15,28,"and has lived in desolate cities, in houses that none should inhabit, which were ready to become heaps of ruins;"
Job,15,29,"he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the earth;"
Job,15,30,"he will not depart from darkness; the flame will dry up his shoots, and by the breath of his mouth he will depart."
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his payment."
Job,15,32,"It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not be green."
Job,15,33,"He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive tree."
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive trouble and give birth to evil, and their womb prepares deceit."""
Job,16,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,16,2,"""I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all."
Job,16,3,Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you."
Job,16,5,"I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain."
Job,16,6,"""If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?"
Job,16,7,Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face."
Job,16,9,He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
Job,16,10,Men have gaped at me with their mouth; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target;"
Job,16,13,his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.
Job,16,14,He breaks me with breach upon breach; he runs upon me like a warrior.
Job,16,15,I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust.
Job,16,16,"My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is deep darkness,"
Job,16,17,"although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure."
Job,16,18,"""O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry find no resting place."
Job,16,19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who testifies for me is on high."
Job,16,20,"My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God,"
Job,16,21,"that he would argue the case of a man with God, as a son of man does with his neighbor."
Job,16,22,For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
Job,17,1,My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me.
Job,17,2,"Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation."
Job,17,3,"""Lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is there who will put up security for me?"
Job,17,4,"Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph."
Job,17,5,He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property--the eyes of his children will fail.
Job,17,6,"""He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit."
Job,17,7,"My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow."
Job,17,8,"The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless."
Job,17,9,"Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger."
Job,17,10,"But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart."
Job,17,12,"They make night into day; 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.'"
Job,17,13,"If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness,"
Job,17,14,"if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,'"
Job,17,15,where then is my hope? Who will see my hope?
Job,17,16,"Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?"""
Job,18,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job,18,2,"""How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak."
Job,18,3,Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight?
Job,18,4,"You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place?"
Job,18,5,"""Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out."
Job,18,7,"His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh."
Job,18,9,A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him.
Job,18,10,"A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path."
Job,18,11,"Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels."
Job,18,12,"His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling."
Job,18,13,It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.
Job,18,14,He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors.
Job,18,15,In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation.
Job,18,16,"His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above."
Job,18,17,"His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street."
Job,18,18,"He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world."
Job,18,19,"He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live."
Job,18,20,"They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east."
Job,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God."""
Job,19,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,19,2,"""How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words?"
Job,19,3,These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me?
Job,19,4,"And even if it be true that I have erred, my error remains with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and make my disgrace an argument against me,"
Job,19,6,know then that God has put me in the wrong and closed his net about me.
Job,19,7,"Behold, I cry out, 'Violence!' but I am not answered; I call for help, but there is no justice."
Job,19,8,"He has walled up my way, so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths."
Job,19,9,He has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head.
Job,19,10,"He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, and my hope has he pulled up like a tree."
Job,19,11,He has kindled his wrath against me and counts me as his adversary.
Job,19,12,His troops come on together; they have cast up their siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
Job,19,13,"""He has put my brothers far from me, and those who knew me are wholly estranged from me."
Job,19,14,"My relatives have failed me, my close friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,The guests in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes.
Job,19,16,"I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy."
Job,19,17,"My breath is strange to my wife, and I am a stench to the children of my own mother."
Job,19,18,Even young children despise me; when I rise they talk against me.
Job,19,19,"All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me."
Job,19,20,"My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth."
Job,19,21,"Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me!"
Job,19,22,"Why do you, like God, pursue me? Why are you not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,"""Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!"
Job,19,24,Oh that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!
Job,19,25,"For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth."
Job,19,26,"And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God,"
Job,19,27,"whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me!"
Job,19,28,"If you say, 'How we will pursue him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him,'"
Job,19,29,"be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment."""
Job,20,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Job,20,2,"""Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me."
Job,20,3,"I hear censure that insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me."
Job,20,4,"Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth,"
Job,20,5,"that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,"
Job,20,7,"he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'"
Job,20,8,He will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
Job,20,9,"The eye that saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him."
Job,20,10,"His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"""Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue,"
Job,20,13,"though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth,"
Job,20,14,yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the venom of cobras within him.
Job,20,15,He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly.
Job,20,16,He will suck the poison of cobras; the tongue of a viper will kill him.
Job,20,17,"He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds."
Job,20,18,He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment.
Job,20,19,For he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he did not build.
Job,20,20,"""Because he knew no contentment in his belly, he will not let anything in which he delights escape him."
Job,20,21,There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure.
Job,20,22,In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him.
Job,20,23,To fill his belly to the full God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body.
Job,20,24,He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through.
Job,20,25,It is drawn forth and comes out of his body; the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder; terrors come upon him.
Job,20,26,Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not fanned will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed.
Job,20,27,"The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him."
Job,20,28,"The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath."
Job,20,29,"This is the wicked man's portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God."""
Job,21,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,21,2,"""Keep listening to my words, and let this be your comfort."
Job,21,3,"Bear with me, and I will speak, and after I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint against man? Why should I not be impatient?"
Job,21,5,"Look at me and be appalled, and lay your hand over your mouth."
Job,21,6,"When I remember I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their offspring are established in their presence, and their descendants before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them."
Job,21,10,Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and does not miscarry.
Job,21,11,"They send out their little boys like a flock, and their children dance."
Job,21,12,They sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol."
Job,21,14,"They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not desire the knowledge of your ways."
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?'"
Job,21,16,"Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand? The counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,"""How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains in his anger?"
Job,21,18,"That they are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away?"
Job,21,19,"You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let him pay it out to them, that they may know it."
Job,21,20,"Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"For what do they care for their houses after them, when the number of their months is cut off?"
Job,21,22,"Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those who are on high?"
Job,21,23,"One dies in his full vigor, being wholly at ease and secure,"
Job,21,24,his pails full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist.
Job,21,25,"Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of prosperity."
Job,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them."
Job,21,27,"""Behold, I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me."
Job,21,28,"For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'"
Job,21,29,"Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony"
Job,21,30,"that the evil man is spared in the day of calamity, that he is rescued in the day of wrath?"
Job,21,31,"Who declares his way to his face, and who repays him for what he has done?"
Job,21,32,"When he is carried to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley are sweet to him; all mankind follows after him, and those who go before him are innumerable."
Job,21,34,"How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood."""
Job,22,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job,22,2,"""Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself."
Job,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?"
Job,22,4,Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you?
Job,22,5,Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities.
Job,22,6,For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job,22,7,"You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it."
Job,22,9,"You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,"
Job,22,11,"or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you."
Job,22,12,"""Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!"
Job,22,13,"But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.'"
Job,22,15,Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod?
Job,22,16,They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away.
Job,22,17,"They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'"
Job,22,18,Yet he filled their houses with good things--but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them,"
Job,22,20,"saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.'"
Job,22,21,"""Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you."
Job,22,22,"Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart."
Job,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents,"
Job,22,24,"if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent bed,"
Job,22,25,then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver.
Job,22,26,For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
Job,22,27,"You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows."
Job,22,28,"You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways."
Job,22,29,"For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly."
Job,22,30,"He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."""
Job,23,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,23,2,"""Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning."
Job,23,3,"Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!"
Job,23,4,I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job,23,5,I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me.
Job,23,6,Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me.
Job,23,7,"There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge."
Job,23,8,"""Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him;"
Job,23,9,"on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him."
Job,23,10,"But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold."
Job,23,11,My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
Job,23,12,I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.
Job,23,13,"But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does."
Job,23,14,"For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind."
Job,23,15,"Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him."
Job,23,16,God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;
Job,23,17,"yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face."
Job,24,1,"""Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days?"
Job,24,2,Some move landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them.
Job,24,3,They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
Job,24,4,They thrust the poor off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves.
Job,24,5,"Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go out to their toil, seeking game; the wasteland yields food for their children."
Job,24,6,"They gather their fodder in the field, and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man."
Job,24,7,"They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,They are wet with the rain of the mountains and cling to the rock for lack of shelter.
Job,24,9,"(There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast, and they take a pledge against the poor.)"
Job,24,10,"They go about naked, without clothing; hungry, they carry the sheaves;"
Job,24,11,"among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil; they tread the winepresses, but suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"From out of the city the dying groan, and the soul of the wounded cries for help; yet God charges no one with wrong."
Job,24,13,"""There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths."
Job,24,14,"The murderer rises before it is light, that he may kill the poor and needy, and in the night he is like a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he veils his face."
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light.
Job,24,17,For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.
Job,24,18,"""You say, 'Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the land; no treader turns toward their vineyards."
Job,24,19,Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned.
Job,24,20,"The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered, so wickedness is broken like a tree.'"
Job,24,21,"""They wrong the barren childless woman, and do no good to the widow."
Job,24,22,Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life.
Job,24,23,"He gives them security, and they are supported, and his eyes are upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like the heads of grain."
Job,24,25,"If it is not so, who will prove me a liar and show that there is nothing in what I say?"""
Job,25,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job,25,2,"""Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven."
Job,25,3,Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure?
Job,25,5,"Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes;"
Job,25,6,"how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!"""
Job,26,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,26,2,"""How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!"
Job,26,3,"How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!"
Job,26,4,"With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you?"
Job,26,5,The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants.
Job,26,6,"Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering."
Job,26,7,He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.
Job,26,8,"He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them."
Job,26,9,He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud.
Job,26,10,He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke.
Job,26,12,By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.
Job,26,13,By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
Job,26,14,"Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"""
Job,27,1,"And Job again took up his discourse, and said:"
Job,27,2,"""As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,"
Job,27,3,"as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit."
Job,27,5,Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job,27,6,I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
Job,27,7,"""Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
Job,27,10,Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
Job,27,11,I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?"
Job,27,13,"""This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty:"
Job,27,14,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread."
Job,27,15,"Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep."
Job,27,16,"Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay,"
Job,27,17,"he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes."
Job,27,19,"He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off.
Job,27,21,The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
Job,27,22,It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight.
Job,27,23,It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place.
Job,28,1,"""Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore."
Job,28,3,Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness.
Job,28,4,"He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro."
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire."
Job,28,6,"Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold."
Job,28,7,"""That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it."
Job,28,8,The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.
Job,28,9,"""Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots."
Job,28,10,"He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing."
Job,28,11,"He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light."
Job,28,12,"""But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?"
Job,28,13,"Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living."
Job,28,14,"The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.'"
Job,28,15,"It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire."
Job,28,17,"Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold."
Job,28,18,No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls.
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold."
Job,28,20,"""From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?"
Job,28,21,It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air.
Job,28,22,"Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'"
Job,28,23,"""God understands the way to it, and he knows its place."
Job,28,24,For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
Job,28,25,"When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure,"
Job,28,26,"when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,"
Job,28,27,"then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out."
Job,28,28,"And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"""
Job,29,1,"And Job again took up his discourse, and said:"
Job,29,2,"""Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,"
Job,29,3,"when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,"
Job,29,4,"as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent,"
Job,29,5,"when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me,"
Job,29,6,"when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!"
Job,29,7,"When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,"
Job,29,8,"the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;"
Job,29,9,the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth;
Job,29,10,"the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved,"
Job,29,12,"because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him."
Job,29,13,"The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy."
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban."
Job,29,15,I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
Job,29,16,"I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know."
Job,29,17,I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth.
Job,29,18,"Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand,"
Job,29,19,"my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches,"
Job,29,20,"my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'"
Job,29,21,"""Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel."
Job,29,22,"After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them."
Job,29,23,"They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain."
Job,29,24,"I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down."
Job,29,25,"I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners."
Job,30,1,"""But now they laugh at me, men who are younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"What could I gain from the strength of their hands, men whose vigor is gone?"
Job,30,3,Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation;
Job,30,4,"they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes, and the roots of the broom tree for their food."
Job,30,5,They are driven out from human company; they shout after them as after a thief.
Job,30,6,"In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks."
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they huddle together.
Job,30,8,"A senseless, a nameless brood, they have been whipped out of the land."
Job,30,9,"""And now I have become their song; I am a byword to them."
Job,30,10,They abhor me; they keep aloof from me; they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me.
Job,30,11,"Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me, they have cast off restraint in my presence."
Job,30,12,On my right hand the rabble rise; they push away my feet; they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
Job,30,13,They break up my path; they promote my calamity; they need no one to help them.
Job,30,14,As through a wide breach they come; amid the crash they roll on.
Job,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud."
Job,30,16,"""And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold of me."
Job,30,17,"The night racks my bones, and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest."
Job,30,18,With great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my tunic.
Job,30,19,"God has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry to you for help and you do not answer me; I stand, and you only look at me."
Job,30,21,You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me.
Job,30,22,"You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm."
Job,30,23,For I know that you will bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living.
Job,30,24,"""Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, and in his disaster cry for help?"
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
Job,30,26,"But when I hoped for good, evil came, and when I waited for light, darkness came."
Job,30,27,My inward parts are in turmoil and never still; days of affliction come to meet me.
Job,30,28,"I go about darkened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help."
Job,30,29,I am a brother of jackals and a companion of ostriches.
Job,30,30,"My skin turns black and falls from me, and my bones burn with heat."
Job,30,31,"My lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe to the voice of those who weep."
Job,31,1,"""I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?"
Job,31,2,What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high?
Job,31,3,"Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity?"
Job,31,4,Does not he see my ways and number all my steps?
Job,31,5,"""If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit;"
Job,31,6,"(Let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!)"
Job,31,7,"if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, and if any spot has stuck to my hands,"
Job,31,8,"then let me sow, and another eat, and let what grows for me be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"""If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door,"
Job,31,10,"then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down on her."
Job,31,11,For that would be a heinous crime; that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
Job,31,12,"for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my increase."
Job,31,13,"""If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me,"
Job,31,14,"what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"""If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,"
Job,31,17,"or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it"
Job,31,18,"(for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow ),"
Job,31,19,"if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or the needy without covering,"
Job,31,20,"if his body has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,"
Job,31,21,"if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate,"
Job,31,22,"then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket."
Job,31,23,"For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty."
Job,31,24,"""If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence,"
Job,31,25,"if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much,"
Job,31,26,"if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,"
Job,31,27,"and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand,"
Job,31,28,"this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have been false to God above."
Job,31,29,"""If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook him"
Job,31,30,"(I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse),"
Job,31,31,"if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?'"
Job,31,32,"(the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler),"
Job,31,33,"if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,"
Job,31,34,"because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors--"
Job,31,35,"Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!"
Job,31,36,Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown;
Job,31,37,I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him.
Job,31,38,"""If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together,"
Job,31,39,"if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last,"
Job,31,40,"let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley.""The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God."
Job,32,3,"He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong."
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
Job,32,5,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: ""I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you."
Job,32,7,"I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'"
Job,32,8,"But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand."
Job,32,9,"It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right."
Job,32,10,"Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'"
Job,32,11,"""Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words."
Job,32,13,"Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.'"
Job,32,14,"He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches."
Job,32,15,"""They are dismayed; they answer no more; they have not a word to say."
Job,32,16,"And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?"
Job,32,17,I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion.
Job,32,18,For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst."
Job,32,20,"I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person.
Job,32,22,"For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away."
Job,33,1,"""But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks."
Job,33,3,"My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely."
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
Job,33,5,"Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you."
Job,33,8,"""Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words."
Job,33,9,"You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy,"
Job,33,11,he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.'
Job,33,12,"""Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,"Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'?"
Job,33,14,"For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds,"
Job,33,16,"then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings,"
Job,33,17,that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man;
Job,33,18,"he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"""Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones,"
Job,33,20,"so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death."
Job,33,23,"If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him,"
Job,33,24,"and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom;"
Job,33,25,let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor';
Job,33,26,"then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me."
Job,33,28,"He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.'"
Job,33,29,"""Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man,"
Job,33,30,"to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life."
Job,33,31,"Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you."
Job,33,33,"If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."""
Job,34,1,Then Elihu answered and said:
Job,34,2,"""Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know;"
Job,34,3,for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food.
Job,34,4,Let us choose what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"For Job has said, 'I am in the right, and God has taken away my right;"
Job,34,6,"in spite of my right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'"
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water,"
Job,34,8,who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men?
Job,34,9,"For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God.'"
Job,34,10,"""Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong."
Job,34,11,"For according to the work of a man he will repay him, and according to his ways he will make it befall him."
Job,34,12,"Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice."
Job,34,13,"Who gave him charge over the earth, and who laid on him the whole world?"
Job,34,14,"If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath,"
Job,34,15,"all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust."
Job,34,16,"""If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say."
Job,34,17,"Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,"
Job,34,18,"who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' and to nobles, 'Wicked man,'"
Job,34,19,"who shows no partiality to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?"
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand."
Job,34,21,"""For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps."
Job,34,22,There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves.
Job,34,23,"For God has no need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place.
Job,34,25,"Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed."
Job,34,26,"He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see,"
Job,34,27,"because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways,"
Job,34,28,"so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted--"
Job,34,29,"When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or a man?--"
Job,34,30,"that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the people."
Job,34,31,"""For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more;"
Job,34,32,"teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?"
Job,34,33,"Will he then make repayment to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know."
Job,34,34,"Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will say:"
Job,34,35,'Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.'
Job,34,36,"Would that Job were tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."""
Job,35,1,And Elihu answered and said:
Job,35,2,"""Do you think this to be just? Do you say, 'It is my right before God,'"
Job,35,3,"that you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?'"
Job,35,4,I will answer you and your friends with you.
Job,35,5,"Look at the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which are higher than you."
Job,35,6,"If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?"
Job,35,7,"If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand?"
Job,35,8,"Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man."
Job,35,9,"""Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty."
Job,35,10,"But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'
Job,35,12,"There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!"
Job,35,15,"And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression,"
Job,35,16,"Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge."""
Job,36,1,"And Elihu continued, and said:"
Job,36,2,"""Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf."
Job,36,3,I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job,36,4,For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Job,36,5,"""Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding."
Job,36,6,"He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right."
Job,36,7,"He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,"then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly."
Job,36,10,He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity.
Job,36,11,"If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness."
Job,36,12,"But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,"""The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them."
Job,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes."
Job,36,15,He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity.
Job,36,16,"He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness."
Job,36,17,"""But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you."
Job,36,18,"Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside."
Job,36,19,"Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength?"
Job,36,20,"Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?"
Job,36,24,"""Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung."
Job,36,25,All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable."
Job,36,27,"For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain,"
Job,36,28,which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly.
Job,36,29,"Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance.
Job,36,32,He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.
Job,36,33,Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises.
Job,37,1,"""At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place."
Job,37,2,Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
Job,37,3,"Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his lightning to the corners of the earth."
Job,37,4,"After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard."
Job,37,5,God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend.
Job,37,6,"For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the downpour, his mighty downpour."
Job,37,7,"He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he made may know it."
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into their lairs, and remain in their dens."
Job,37,9,"From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds."
Job,37,10,"By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast."
Job,37,11,He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning.
Job,37,12,"They turn around and around by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world."
Job,37,13,"Whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen."
Job,37,14,"""Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
Job,37,16,"Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge,"
Job,37,17,you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind?
Job,37,18,"Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror?"
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness.
Job,37,20,Shall it be told him that I would speak? Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up?
Job,37,21,"""And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them."
Job,37,22,Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty.
Job,37,23,The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power; justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate.
Job,37,24,"Therefore men fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit."""
Job,38,1,Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
Job,38,2,"""Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?"
Job,38,3,"Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me."
Job,38,4,"""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding."
Job,38,5,Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
Job,38,6,"On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone,"
Job,38,7,when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job,38,8,"""Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb,"
Job,38,9,"when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band,"
Job,38,10,"and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors,"
Job,38,11,"and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'?"
Job,38,12,"""Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,"
Job,38,13,"that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,"It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment."
Job,38,15,"From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken."
Job,38,16,"""Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?"
Job,38,17,"Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?"
Job,38,18,"Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this."
Job,38,19,"""Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,"
Job,38,20,that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?
Job,38,21,"You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!"
Job,38,22,"""Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,"
Job,38,23,"which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?"
Job,38,25,"""Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt,"
Job,38,26,"to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man,"
Job,38,27,"to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass?"
Job,38,28,"""Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?"
Job,38,29,"From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven?"
Job,38,30,"The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen."
Job,38,31,"""Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?"
Job,38,32,"Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?"
Job,38,33,Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?
Job,38,34,"""Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that a flood of waters may cover you?"
Job,38,35,"Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'?"
Job,38,36,Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind?
Job,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,"
Job,38,38,when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together?
Job,38,39,"""Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
Job,38,40,when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their thicket?
Job,38,41,"Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God for help, and wander about for lack of food?"
Job,39,1,"""Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the does?"
Job,39,2,"Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth,"
Job,39,3,"when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young?"
Job,39,4,Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open; they go out and do not return to them.
Job,39,5,"""Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,"
Job,39,6,to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place?
Job,39,7,He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver.
Job,39,8,"He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing."
Job,39,9,"""Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your manger?"
Job,39,10,"Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you?"
Job,39,11,"Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor?"
Job,39,12,Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
Job,39,13,"""The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the pinions and plumage of love?"
Job,39,14,"For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground,"
Job,39,15,forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them.
Job,39,16,"She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear,"
Job,39,17,because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding.
Job,39,18,"When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider."
Job,39,19,"""Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane?"
Job,39,20,Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying.
Job,39,21,He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons.
Job,39,22,He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not turn back from the sword.
Job,39,23,"Upon him rattle the quiver, the flashing spear and the javelin."
Job,39,24,With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground; he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
Job,39,25,"When the trumpet sounds, he says 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
Job,39,26,"""Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south?"
Job,39,27,Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high?
Job,39,28,"On the rock he dwells and makes his home, on the rocky crag and stronghold."

Job,40,1,And the LORD said to Job:
Job,40,2,"""Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it."""
Job,40,3,Then Job answered the LORD and said:
Job,40,4,"""Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth."
Job,40,5,"I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further."""
Job,40,6,Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
Job,40,7,"""Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me."
Job,40,8,Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be in the right?
Job,40,9,"Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his?"
Job,40,10,"""Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor."
Job,40,11,"Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him."
Job,40,12,Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand.
Job,40,13,Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below.
Job,40,14,Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you.
Job,40,15,"""Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox."
Job,40,16,"Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly."
Job,40,17,He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job,40,18,"His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron."
Job,40,19,"""He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword!"

Job,40,22,For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him.
Job,40,23,"Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth."

Job,41,1,"""Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord?"
Job,41,2,Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?

Job,41,4,Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever?
Job,41,5,"Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you put him on a leash for your girls?"

Job,41,8,Lay your hands on him; remember the battle--you will not do it again!
Job,41,9,"Behold, the hope of a man is false; he is laid low even at the sight of him."
Job,41,10,No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?
Job,41,11,"Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine."
Job,41,12,"""I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame."
Job,41,13,Who can strip off his outer garment? Who would come near him with a bridle?
Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.
Job,41,15,"His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal."
Job,41,16,One is so near to another that no air can come between them.
Job,41,17,They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
Job,41,18,"His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn."
Job,41,19,Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap forth.
Job,41,20,"Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes."

Job,41,24,"His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the lower millstone."
Job,41,25,When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.
Job,41,26,"Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin."
Job,41,27,"He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood."
Job,41,28,The arrow cannot make him flee; for him sling stones are turned to stubble.
Job,41,29,Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins.
Job,41,30,His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire.
Job,41,31,He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job,41,32,Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be white-haired.
Job,41,33,"On earth there is not his like, a creature without fear."
Job,41,34,"He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride."""
Job,42,1,Then Job answered the LORD and said:
Job,42,2,"""I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
Job,42,3,"'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."
Job,42,4,"'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you make it known to me.'"
Job,42,5,"I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;"
Job,42,6,"therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."""
Job,42,7,"After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: ""My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."
Job,42,8,"Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."""
Job,42,9,"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer."
Job,42,10,"And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before."
Job,42,11,"Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold."
Job,42,12,"And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys."
Job,42,13,He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,14,"And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch."
Job,42,15,And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
Job,42,16,"And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations."
Job,42,17,"And Job died, an old man, and full of days."
Psalm,1,1,"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;"
