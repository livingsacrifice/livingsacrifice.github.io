Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters."
Genesis,1,3,"And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light."
Genesis,1,4,"God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness."
Genesis,1,5,"God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day."
Genesis,1,6,"And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”"
Genesis,1,7,So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.
Genesis,1,8,"God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day."
Genesis,1,9,"And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,10,"God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,12,The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
Genesis,1,13,"And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day."
Genesis,1,14,"And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,"
Genesis,1,15,and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.
Genesis,1,16,God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
Genesis,1,17,"God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,19,"And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day."
Genesis,1,20,"And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.”"
Genesis,1,21,"So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,22,"God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,23,"And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day."
Genesis,1,24,"And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”"
Genesis,1,27,"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them."
Genesis,1,28,"God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”"
Genesis,1,29,"Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food."
Genesis,1,30,And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.
Genesis,1,31,"God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
Genesis,2,2,By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
Genesis,2,3,"Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done."
Genesis,2,4,"This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens."
Genesis,2,5,"Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,"
Genesis,2,6,but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
Genesis,2,7,"Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being."
Genesis,2,8,"Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed."
Genesis,2,9,The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis,2,10,A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold."
Genesis,2,12,(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)
Genesis,2,13,The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
Genesis,2,14,The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis,2,15,The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
Genesis,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;"
Genesis,2,17,"but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”"
Genesis,2,18,"The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”"
Genesis,2,19,"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name."
Genesis,2,20,"So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found."
Genesis,2,21,"So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh."
Genesis,2,22,"Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man."
Genesis,2,23,"The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.”"
Genesis,2,24,"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,"Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame."
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,"
Genesis,3,3,"but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”"
Genesis,3,4,"“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman."
Genesis,3,5,"“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”"
Genesis,3,6,"When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it."
Genesis,3,7,"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves."
Genesis,3,8,"Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,9,"But the LORD God called to the man, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”"
Genesis,3,11,"And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”"
Genesis,3,12,"The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”"
Genesis,3,13,"Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,14,"So the LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, “Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,15,"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”"
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”"
Genesis,3,17,"To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’ “Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,18,"It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field."
Genesis,3,19,"By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.”"
Genesis,3,20,"Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living."
Genesis,3,21,The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
Genesis,3,22,"And the LORD God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”"
Genesis,3,23,So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
Genesis,3,24,"After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life."
Genesis,4,1,"Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man.”"
Genesis,4,2,"Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil."
Genesis,4,3,In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.
Genesis,4,4,"And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,"but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast."
Genesis,4,6,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?"
Genesis,4,7,"If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”"
Genesis,4,8,"Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”"
Genesis,4,10,"The LORD said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,"Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand."
Genesis,4,12,"When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”"
Genesis,4,13,"Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is more than I can bear."
Genesis,4,14,"Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,"But the LORD said to him, “Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him."
Genesis,4,16,"So Cain went out from the LORD’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch."
Genesis,4,18,"To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
Genesis,4,21,His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.
Genesis,4,22,"Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah."
Genesis,4,23,"Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me."
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.”"
Genesis,4,25,"Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”"
Genesis,4,26,"Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the LORD."
Genesis,5,1,"This is the written account of Adam’s family line. When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God."
Genesis,5,2,He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them “Mankind” when they were created.
Genesis,5,3,"When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth."
Genesis,5,4,"After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,5,"Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,6,"When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh."
Genesis,5,7,"After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,8,"Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,9,"When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan."
Genesis,5,10,"After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,11,"Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,12,"When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel."
Genesis,5,13,"After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,14,"Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,15,"When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared."
Genesis,5,16,"After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,17,"Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,18,"When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch."
Genesis,5,19,"After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,20,"Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,21,"When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah."
Genesis,5,22,"After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,23,"Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years."
Genesis,5,24,"Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away."
Genesis,5,25,"When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech."
Genesis,5,26,"After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,27,"Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,28,"When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son."
Genesis,5,29,"He named him Noah and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed.”"
Genesis,5,30,"After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,31,"Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died."
Genesis,5,32,"After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth."
Genesis,6,1,"When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,"
Genesis,6,2,"the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose."
Genesis,6,3,"Then the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.”"
Genesis,6,4,"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown."
Genesis,6,5,"The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time."
Genesis,6,6,"The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled."
Genesis,6,7,"So the LORD said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”"
Genesis,6,8,But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis,6,9,"This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God."
Genesis,6,10,"Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth."
Genesis,6,11,Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.
Genesis,6,12,"God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways."
Genesis,6,13,"So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth."
Genesis,6,14,So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
Genesis,6,15,"This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high."
Genesis,6,16,"Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks."
Genesis,6,17,"I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish."
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,6,19,"You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you."
Genesis,6,20,"Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive."
Genesis,6,21,You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.”
Genesis,6,22,Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
Genesis,7,1,"The LORD then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation."
Genesis,7,2,"Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,"
Genesis,7,3,"and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth."
Genesis,7,4,"Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.”"
Genesis,7,5,And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
Genesis,7,7,And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
Genesis,7,8,"Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,"
Genesis,7,9,"male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah."
Genesis,7,10,And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened."
Genesis,7,12,And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,"On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark."
Genesis,7,14,"They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings."
Genesis,7,15,Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
Genesis,7,16,"The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in."
Genesis,7,17,"For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth."
Genesis,7,18,"The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water."
Genesis,7,19,"They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered."
Genesis,7,20,The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.
Genesis,7,21,"Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind."
Genesis,7,22,Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
Genesis,7,23,"Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark."
Genesis,7,24,The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
Genesis,8,1,"But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded."
Genesis,8,2,"Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky."
Genesis,8,3,"The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,"
Genesis,8,4,and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
Genesis,8,5,"The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible."
Genesis,8,6,After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark
Genesis,8,7,"and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth."
Genesis,8,8,Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.
Genesis,8,9,But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
Genesis,8,10,He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
Genesis,8,11,"When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth."
Genesis,8,12,"He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him."
Genesis,8,13,"By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry."
Genesis,8,14,By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
Genesis,8,15,"Then God said to Noah,"
Genesis,8,16,"“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.”"
Genesis,8,18,"So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives."
Genesis,8,19,"All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another."
Genesis,8,20,"Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it."
Genesis,8,21,"The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"“As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.”"
Genesis,9,1,"Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands."
Genesis,9,3,"Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything."
Genesis,9,4,“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
Genesis,9,5,"And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being."
Genesis,9,6,"“Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind."
Genesis,9,7,"As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”"
Genesis,9,8,Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
Genesis,9,9,“I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth."
Genesis,9,11,I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
Genesis,9,12,"And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:"
Genesis,9,13,"I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,"
Genesis,9,15,I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
Genesis,9,16,"Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,17,"So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,18,"The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)"
Genesis,9,19,"These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth."
Genesis,9,20,"Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard."
Genesis,9,21,"When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent."
Genesis,9,22,"Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside."
Genesis,9,23,But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked.
Genesis,9,24,"When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,"
Genesis,9,25,"he said, “Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.”"
Genesis,9,26,"He also said, “Praise be to the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem."
Genesis,9,27,"May God extend Japheth’s territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.”"
Genesis,9,28,After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
Genesis,9,29,"Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died."
Genesis,10,1,"This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood."
Genesis,10,2,"The Japhethites The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras."
Genesis,10,3,"The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah."
Genesis,10,4,"The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites."
Genesis,10,5,"(From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.)"
Genesis,10,6,"The Hamites The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan."
Genesis,10,7,"The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan."
Genesis,10,8,"Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth."
Genesis,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”"
Genesis,10,10,"The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar."
Genesis,10,11,"From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah"
Genesis,10,12,"and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city."
Genesis,10,13,"Egypt was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,"
Genesis,10,14,"Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites."
Genesis,10,15,"Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,"
Genesis,10,16,"Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,"
Genesis,10,17,"Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,"
Genesis,10,18,"Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered"
Genesis,10,19,"and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha."
Genesis,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations."
Genesis,10,21,"The Semites Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber."
Genesis,10,22,"The sons of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram."
Genesis,10,23,"The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek."
Genesis,10,24,"Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber."
Genesis,10,25,"Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan."
Genesis,10,26,"Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,"
Genesis,10,27,"Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,"
Genesis,10,28,"Obal, Abimael, Sheba,"
Genesis,10,29,"Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan."
Genesis,10,30,"The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country."
Genesis,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations."
Genesis,10,32,"These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood."
Genesis,11,1,Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
Genesis,11,2,"As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there."
Genesis,11,3,"They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar."
Genesis,11,4,"Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”"
Genesis,11,5,But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.
Genesis,11,6,"The LORD said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them."
Genesis,11,7,"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”"
Genesis,11,8,"So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city."
Genesis,11,9,That is why it was called Babel—because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
Genesis,11,10,"This is the account of Shem’s family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad."
Genesis,11,11,"And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,12,"When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah."
Genesis,11,13,"And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,14,"When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber."
Genesis,11,15,"And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,16,"When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg."
Genesis,11,17,"And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,18,"When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu."
Genesis,11,19,"And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,20,"When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug."
Genesis,11,21,"And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,22,"When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor."
Genesis,11,23,"And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,24,"When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah."
Genesis,11,25,"And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,26,"After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran."
Genesis,11,27,"This is the account of Terah’s family line. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth."
Genesis,11,29,"Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah."
Genesis,11,30,Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive.
Genesis,11,31,"Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there."
Genesis,11,32,"Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Harran."
Genesis,12,1,"The LORD had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you."
Genesis,12,2,"“I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing."
Genesis,12,3,"I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”"
Genesis,12,4,"So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran."
Genesis,12,5,"He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there."
Genesis,12,6,Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
Genesis,12,7,"The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him."
Genesis,12,8,"From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD."
Genesis,12,9,Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
Genesis,12,10,"Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe."
Genesis,12,11,"As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are."
Genesis,12,12,"When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live."
Genesis,12,13,"Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”"
Genesis,12,14,"When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman."
Genesis,12,15,"And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace."
Genesis,12,16,"He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels."
Genesis,12,17,But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
Genesis,12,18,So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?
Genesis,12,19,"Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!”"
Genesis,12,20,"Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had."
Genesis,13,1,"So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him."
Genesis,13,2,Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
Genesis,13,3,"From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier"
Genesis,13,4,and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents."
Genesis,13,6,"But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together."
Genesis,13,7,And quarreling arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
Genesis,13,8,"So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives."
Genesis,13,9,"Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”"
Genesis,13,10,"Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)"
Genesis,13,11,So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:
Genesis,13,12,"Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.
Genesis,13,14,"The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west."
Genesis,13,15,All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.
Genesis,13,16,"I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted."
Genesis,13,17,"Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”"
Genesis,13,18,"So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the LORD."
Genesis,14,1,"At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim,"
Genesis,14,2,"these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)."
Genesis,14,3,"All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley)."
Genesis,14,4,"For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
Genesis,14,5,"In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim"
Genesis,14,6,"and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert."
Genesis,14,7,"Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar."
Genesis,14,8,"Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim"
Genesis,14,9,"against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five."
Genesis,14,10,"Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills."
Genesis,14,11,The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.
Genesis,14,12,"They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom."
Genesis,14,13,"A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram."
Genesis,14,14,"When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan."
Genesis,14,15,"During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people."
Genesis,14,17,"After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley)."
Genesis,14,18,"Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,"
Genesis,14,19,"and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth."
Genesis,14,20,"And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything."
Genesis,14,21,"The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”"
Genesis,14,22,"But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,23,"that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’"
Genesis,14,24,"I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”"
Genesis,15,1,"After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.”"
Genesis,15,2,"But Abram said, “Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”"
Genesis,15,3,"And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”"
Genesis,15,4,"Then the word of the LORD came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.”"
Genesis,15,5,"He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”"
Genesis,15,6,"Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness."
Genesis,15,7,"He also said to him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”"
Genesis,15,8,"But Abram said, “Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”"
Genesis,15,9,"So the LORD said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,"Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half."
Genesis,15,11,"Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away."
Genesis,15,12,"As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him."
Genesis,15,13,"Then the LORD said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there."
Genesis,15,14,"But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions."
Genesis,15,15,"You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age."
Genesis,15,16,"In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”"
Genesis,15,17,"When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces."
Genesis,15,18,"On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—"
Genesis,15,19,"the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,"
Genesis,15,20,"Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,"
Genesis,15,21,"Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”"
Genesis,16,1,"Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar;"
Genesis,16,2,"so she said to Abram, “The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said."
Genesis,16,3,"So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife."
Genesis,16,4,"He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress."
Genesis,16,5,"Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me.”"
Genesis,16,6,"“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her."
Genesis,16,7,The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
Genesis,16,8,"And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered."
Genesis,16,9,"Then the angel of the LORD told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”"
Genesis,16,10,"The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.”"
Genesis,16,11,"The angel of the LORD also said to her: “You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard of your misery."
Genesis,16,12,"He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”"
Genesis,16,13,"She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”"
Genesis,16,14,"That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered."
Genesis,16,15,"So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne."
Genesis,16,16,Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
Genesis,17,1,"When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty; walk before me faithfully and be blameless."
Genesis,17,2,Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.”
Genesis,17,3,"Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,"
Genesis,17,4,"“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations."
Genesis,17,5,"No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations."
Genesis,17,6,"I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you."
Genesis,17,7,"I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you."
Genesis,17,8,"The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.”"
Genesis,17,9,"Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come."
Genesis,17,10,"This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised."
Genesis,17,11,"You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you."
Genesis,17,12,"For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring."
Genesis,17,13,"Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant."
Genesis,17,14,"Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”"
Genesis,17,15,"God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah."
Genesis,17,16,I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”
Genesis,17,17,"Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?”"
Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!”"
Genesis,17,19,"Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him."
Genesis,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation."
Genesis,17,21,"But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”"
Genesis,17,22,"When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him."
Genesis,17,23,"On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him."
Genesis,17,24,"Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,"
Genesis,17,25,and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
Genesis,17,26,Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day.
Genesis,17,27,"And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him."
Genesis,18,1,The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.
Genesis,18,2,"Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground."
Genesis,18,3,"He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by."
Genesis,18,4,"Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree."
Genesis,18,5,"Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.” “Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”"
Genesis,18,6,"So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.”"
Genesis,18,7,"Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it."
Genesis,18,8,"He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree."
Genesis,18,9,"“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There, in the tent,” he said."
Genesis,18,10,"Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him."
Genesis,18,11,"Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing."
Genesis,18,12,"So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?”"
Genesis,18,13,"Then the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’"
Genesis,18,14,"Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”"
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”"
Genesis,18,16,"When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way."
Genesis,18,17,"Then the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?"
Genesis,18,18,"Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him."
Genesis,18,19,"For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.”"
Genesis,18,20,"Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous"
Genesis,18,21,"that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”"
Genesis,18,22,"The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD."
Genesis,18,23,Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis,18,24,What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
Genesis,18,25,"Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?”"
Genesis,18,26,"The LORD said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”"
Genesis,18,27,"Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,"
Genesis,18,28,"what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?” “If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”"
Genesis,18,29,"Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”"
Genesis,18,30,"Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”"
Genesis,18,31,"Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”"
Genesis,18,32,"Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”"
Genesis,18,33,"When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home."
Genesis,19,1,"The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground."
Genesis,19,2,"“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”"
Genesis,19,3,"But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house."
Genesis,19,5,"They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”"
Genesis,19,6,Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
Genesis,19,7,"and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing."
Genesis,19,8,"Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”"
Genesis,19,9,"“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door."
Genesis,19,10,But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
Genesis,19,11,"Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door."
Genesis,19,12,"The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,"
Genesis,19,13,because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”
Genesis,19,14,"So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking."
Genesis,19,15,"With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”"
Genesis,19,16,"When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them."
Genesis,19,17,"As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”"
Genesis,19,18,"But Lot said to them, “No, my lords, please!"
Genesis,19,19,"Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die."
Genesis,19,20,"Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”"
Genesis,19,21,"He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of."
Genesis,19,22,"But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.)"
Genesis,19,23,"By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land."
Genesis,19,24,Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens.
Genesis,19,25,"Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land."
Genesis,19,26,"But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis,19,27,Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
Genesis,19,28,"He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived."
Genesis,19,30,"Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave."
Genesis,19,31,"One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth."
Genesis,19,32,Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.”
Genesis,19,33,"That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up."
Genesis,19,34,"The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”"
Genesis,19,35,"So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up."
Genesis,19,36,So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
Genesis,19,37,"The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today."
Genesis,19,38,"The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today."
Genesis,20,1,"Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,"
Genesis,20,2,"and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her."
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”"
Genesis,20,4,"Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?"
Genesis,20,5,"Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”"
Genesis,20,6,"Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”"
Genesis,20,8,"Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid."
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.”"
Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”"
Genesis,20,11,"Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’"
Genesis,20,12,"Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”"
Genesis,20,14,"Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him."
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”"
Genesis,20,16,"To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”"
Genesis,20,17,"Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again,"
Genesis,20,18,for the LORD had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah.
Genesis,21,1,"Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised."
Genesis,21,2,"Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him."
Genesis,21,3,Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.
Genesis,21,4,"When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis,21,6,"Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”"
Genesis,21,7,"And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”"
Genesis,21,8,"The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast."
Genesis,21,9,"But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,"
Genesis,21,10,"and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”"
Genesis,21,11,The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
Genesis,21,12,"But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned."
Genesis,21,13,"I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.”"
Genesis,21,14,Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.
Genesis,21,15,"When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes."
Genesis,21,16,"Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she began to sob."
Genesis,21,17,"God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there."
Genesis,21,18,"Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”"
Genesis,21,19,Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
Genesis,21,20,God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.
Genesis,21,21,"While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt."
Genesis,21,22,"At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do."
Genesis,21,23,Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.”
Genesis,21,24,"Abraham said, “I swear it.”"
Genesis,21,25,Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized.
Genesis,21,26,"But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”"
Genesis,21,27,"So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty."
Genesis,21,28,"Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,"
Genesis,21,29,"and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”"
Genesis,21,30,"He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”"
Genesis,21,31,"So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there."
Genesis,21,32,"After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Eternal God."
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
Genesis,22,1,"Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied."
Genesis,22,2,"Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”"
Genesis,22,3,"Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about."
Genesis,22,4,On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
Genesis,22,5,"He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.”"
Genesis,22,6,"Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,"
Genesis,22,7,"Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?” “Yes, my son?” Abraham replied. “The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”"
Genesis,22,8,"Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together."
Genesis,22,9,"When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood."
Genesis,22,10,Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis,22,11,"But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied."
Genesis,22,12,"“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.”"
Genesis,22,13,Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
Genesis,22,14,"So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”"
Genesis,22,15,The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time
Genesis,22,16,"and said, “I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,"
Genesis,22,17,"I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,"
Genesis,22,18,"and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.”"
Genesis,22,19,"Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba."
Genesis,22,20,"Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:"
Genesis,22,21,"Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),"
Genesis,22,22,"Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”"
Genesis,22,23,Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
Genesis,22,24,"His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah."
Genesis,23,1,Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.
Genesis,23,2,"She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her."
Genesis,23,3,"Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said,"
Genesis,23,4,“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.”
Genesis,23,5,"The Hittites replied to Abraham,"
Genesis,23,6,"“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”"
Genesis,23,7,"Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites."
Genesis,23,8,"He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf"
Genesis,23,9,"so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.”"
Genesis,23,10,Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
Genesis,23,11,"“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,12,Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
Genesis,23,13,"and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”"
Genesis,23,14,"Ephron answered Abraham,"
Genesis,23,15,"“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,16,"Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants."
Genesis,23,17,"So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded"
Genesis,23,18,to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.
Genesis,23,19,Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,23,20,So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
Genesis,24,1,"Abraham was now very old, and the LORD had blessed him in every way."
Genesis,24,2,"He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh."
Genesis,24,3,"I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,"
Genesis,24,4,but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
Genesis,24,5,"The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?”"
Genesis,24,6,"“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said."
Genesis,24,7,"“The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land’—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there."
Genesis,24,8,"If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”"
Genesis,24,9,So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
Genesis,24,10,"Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor."
Genesis,24,11,"He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water."
Genesis,24,12,"Then he prayed, “LORD, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,"See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water."
Genesis,24,14,"May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”"
Genesis,24,15,"Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor."
Genesis,24,16,"The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again."
Genesis,24,17,"The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”"
Genesis,24,18,"“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink."
Genesis,24,19,"After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.”"
Genesis,24,20,"So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels."
Genesis,24,21,"Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful."
Genesis,24,22,"When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels."
Genesis,24,23,"Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”"
Genesis,24,24,"She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.”"
Genesis,24,25,"And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.”"
Genesis,24,26,"Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,"
Genesis,24,27,"saying, “Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”"
Genesis,24,28,The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
Genesis,24,29,"Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring."
Genesis,24,30,"As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring."
Genesis,24,31,"“Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”"
Genesis,24,32,"So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet."
Genesis,24,33,"Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” “Then tell us,” Laban said."
Genesis,24,34,"So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant."
Genesis,24,35,"The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,24,36,"My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns."
Genesis,24,37,"And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,"
Genesis,24,38,"but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’"
Genesis,24,39,"“Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’"
Genesis,24,40,"“He replied, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family."
Genesis,24,41,"You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’"
Genesis,24,42,"“When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come."
Genesis,24,43,"See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”"
Genesis,24,44,"and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master’s son.’"
Genesis,24,45,"“Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’"
Genesis,24,46,"“She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also."
Genesis,24,47,"“I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ “She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.’ “Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,"
Genesis,24,48,"and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son."
Genesis,24,49,"Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.”"
Genesis,24,50,"Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other."
Genesis,24,51,"Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has directed.”"
Genesis,24,52,"When Abraham’s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD."
Genesis,24,53,Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
Genesis,24,54,"Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”"
Genesis,24,55,"But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you may go.”"
Genesis,24,56,"But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.”"
Genesis,24,57,"Then they said, “Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it.”"
Genesis,24,58,"So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she said."
Genesis,24,59,"So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men."
Genesis,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies.”"
Genesis,24,61,Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
Genesis,24,62,"Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev."
Genesis,24,63,"He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching."
Genesis,24,64,Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
Genesis,24,65,"and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” “He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
Genesis,24,67,"Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."
Genesis,25,1,"Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah."
Genesis,25,2,"She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites."
Genesis,25,4,"The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah."
Genesis,25,5,Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,"But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east."
Genesis,25,7,Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.
Genesis,25,8,"Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,9,"His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,"
Genesis,25,10,the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
Genesis,25,11,"After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi."
Genesis,25,12,"This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham."
Genesis,25,13,"These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
Genesis,25,14,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah."
Genesis,25,16,"These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps."
Genesis,25,17,"Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,18,"His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward all the tribes related to them."
Genesis,25,19,"This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,"
Genesis,25,20,and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
Genesis,25,21,"Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant."
Genesis,25,22,"The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the LORD."
Genesis,25,23,"The LORD said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”"
Genesis,25,24,"When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,"The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau."
Genesis,25,26,"After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them."
Genesis,25,27,"The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents."
Genesis,25,28,"Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
Genesis,25,29,"Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished."
Genesis,25,30,"He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom.)"
Genesis,25,31,"Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”"
Genesis,25,32,"“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”"
Genesis,25,33,"But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob."
Genesis,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright."
Genesis,26,1,Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar.
Genesis,26,2,"The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live."
Genesis,26,3,"Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham."
Genesis,26,4,"I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed,"
Genesis,26,5,"because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.”"
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,"When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”"
Genesis,26,8,"When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah."
Genesis,26,9,"So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”"
Genesis,26,10,"Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”"
Genesis,26,11,So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
Genesis,26,12,"Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him."
Genesis,26,13,"The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy."
Genesis,26,14,He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
Genesis,26,15,"So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth."
Genesis,26,16,"Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”"
Genesis,26,17,"So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled."
Genesis,26,18,"Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them."
Genesis,26,19,Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.
Genesis,26,20,"But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him."
Genesis,26,21,"Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah."
Genesis,26,22,"He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, “Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land.”"
Genesis,26,23,From there he went up to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,"That night the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”"
Genesis,26,25,"Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well."
Genesis,26,26,"Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces."
Genesis,26,27,"Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”"
Genesis,26,28,"They answered, “We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you"
Genesis,26,29,"that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the LORD.”"
Genesis,26,30,"Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully."
Genesis,26,32,"That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!”"
Genesis,26,33,"He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba."
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite."
Genesis,26,35,They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” he answered."
Genesis,27,2,"Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death."
Genesis,27,3,"Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me."
Genesis,27,4,"Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.”"
Genesis,27,5,"Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,"
Genesis,27,6,"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,"
Genesis,27,7,"‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.’"
Genesis,27,8,"Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:"
Genesis,27,9,"Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it."
Genesis,27,10,"Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.”"
Genesis,27,11,"Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin."
Genesis,27,12,What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.”
Genesis,27,13,"His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.”"
Genesis,27,14,"So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it."
Genesis,27,15,"Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob."
Genesis,27,16,She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.
Genesis,27,17,Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
Genesis,27,18,"He went to his father and said, “My father.” “Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?”"
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,20,"Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” “The LORD your God gave me success,” he replied."
Genesis,27,21,"Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”"
Genesis,27,22,"Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”"
Genesis,27,23,"He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him."
Genesis,27,24,"“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked. “I am,” he replied."
Genesis,27,25,"Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.” Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.”"
Genesis,27,27,"So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed."
Genesis,27,28,May God give you heaven’s dew and earth’s richness— an abundance of grain and new wine.
Genesis,27,29,"May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.”"
Genesis,27,30,"After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,32,"His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” “I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.”"
Genesis,27,33,"Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!”"
Genesis,27,34,"When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!”"
Genesis,27,35,"But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,36,"Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?”"
Genesis,27,37,"Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?”"
Genesis,27,38,"Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud."
Genesis,27,39,"His father Isaac answered him, “Your dwelling will be away from the earth’s richness, away from the dew of heaven above."
Genesis,27,40,"You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.”"
Genesis,27,41,"Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”"
Genesis,27,42,"When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you."
Genesis,27,43,"Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran."
Genesis,27,44,Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides.
Genesis,27,45,"When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”"
Genesis,27,46,"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”"
Genesis,28,1,So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.
Genesis,28,2,"Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother."
Genesis,28,3,May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.
Genesis,28,4,"May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”"
Genesis,28,5,"Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau."
Genesis,28,6,"Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”"
Genesis,28,7,and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.
Genesis,28,8,Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;
Genesis,28,9,"so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had."
Genesis,28,10,Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran.
Genesis,28,11,"When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep."
Genesis,28,12,"He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it."
Genesis,28,13,"There above it stood the LORD, and he said: “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying."
Genesis,28,14,"Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring."
Genesis,28,15,"I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”"
Genesis,28,16,"When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it.”"
Genesis,28,17,"He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”"
Genesis,28,18,Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.
Genesis,28,19,"He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz."
Genesis,28,20,"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear"
Genesis,28,21,"so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the LORD will be my God"
Genesis,28,22,"and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.”"
Genesis,29,1,Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.
Genesis,29,2,"There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large."
Genesis,29,3,"When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Harran,” they replied."
Genesis,29,5,"He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” “Yes, we know him,” they answered."
Genesis,29,6,"Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?” “Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,7,"“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”"
Genesis,29,8,"“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,9,"While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd."
Genesis,29,10,"When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep."
Genesis,29,11,Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.
Genesis,29,12,He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
Genesis,29,13,"As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things."
Genesis,29,14,"After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,"
Genesis,29,15,"Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”"
Genesis,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,"Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful."
Genesis,29,18,"Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”"
Genesis,29,19,"Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”"
Genesis,29,20,"So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her."
Genesis,29,21,"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.”"
Genesis,29,22,So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.
Genesis,29,23,"But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her."
Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant.
Genesis,29,25,"When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?”"
Genesis,29,26,"Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one."
Genesis,29,27,"Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.”"
Genesis,29,28,"And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife."
Genesis,29,29,Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant.
Genesis,29,30,"Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years."
Genesis,29,31,"When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless."
Genesis,29,32,"Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.”"
Genesis,29,33,"She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon."
Genesis,29,34,"Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi."
Genesis,29,35,"She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children."
Genesis,30,1,"When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”"
Genesis,30,2,"Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”"
Genesis,30,3,"Then she said, “Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.”"
Genesis,30,4,"So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,"
Genesis,30,5,and she became pregnant and bore him a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she named him Dan."
Genesis,30,7,Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,8,"Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So she named him Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife."
Genesis,30,10,Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,"Then Leah said, “What good fortune!” So she named him Gad."
Genesis,30,12,Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,13,"Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,15,"But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son’s mandrakes too?” “Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,16,"So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night."
Genesis,30,17,"God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
Genesis,30,20,"Then Leah said, “God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
Genesis,30,22,Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive.
Genesis,30,23,"She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”"
Genesis,30,24,"She named him Joseph, and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.”"
Genesis,30,25,"After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.”"
Genesis,30,27,"But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.”"
Genesis,30,28,"He added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”"
Genesis,30,29,"Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care."
Genesis,30,30,"The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?”"
Genesis,30,31,"“What shall I give you?” he asked. “Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:"
Genesis,30,32,"Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages."
Genesis,30,33,"And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.”"
Genesis,30,34,"“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”"
Genesis,30,35,"That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons."
Genesis,30,36,"Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks."
Genesis,30,37,"Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches."
Genesis,30,38,"Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,"
Genesis,30,39,they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
Genesis,30,40,"Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals."
Genesis,30,41,"Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,"
Genesis,30,42,"but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob."
Genesis,30,43,"In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,31,1,"Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”"
Genesis,31,2,And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.
Genesis,31,3,"Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”"
Genesis,31,4,So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.
Genesis,31,5,"He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me."
Genesis,31,6,"You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,"
Genesis,31,7,"yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me."
Genesis,31,8,"If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young."
Genesis,31,9,So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"“In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted."
Genesis,31,11,"The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’"
Genesis,31,12,"And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’”"
Genesis,31,14,"Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate?"
Genesis,31,15,"Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us."
Genesis,31,16,Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.”
Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,"
Genesis,31,18,"and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,31,19,"When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods."
Genesis,31,20,"Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away."
Genesis,31,21,"So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
Genesis,31,23,"Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”"
Genesis,31,25,"Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too."
Genesis,31,26,"Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war."
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?"
Genesis,31,28,You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.
Genesis,31,29,"I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’"
Genesis,31,30,Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?”
Genesis,31,31,"Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force."
Genesis,31,32,"But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods."
Genesis,31,33,"So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent."
Genesis,31,34,Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
Genesis,31,35,"Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods."
Genesis,31,36,Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?
Genesis,31,37,"Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us."
Genesis,31,38,"“I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks."
Genesis,31,39,I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
Genesis,31,40,"This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes."
Genesis,31,41,"It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times."
Genesis,31,42,"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.”"
Genesis,31,43,"Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?"
Genesis,31,44,"Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.”"
Genesis,31,45,So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Genesis,31,46,"He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap."
Genesis,31,47,"Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed."
Genesis,31,48,"Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed."
Genesis,31,49,"It was also called Mizpah, because he said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other."
Genesis,31,50,"If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”"
Genesis,31,51,"Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me."
Genesis,31,52,"This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me."
Genesis,31,53,"May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,54,"He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there."
Genesis,31,55,Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
Genesis,32,1,"Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
Genesis,32,2,"When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now."
Genesis,32,5,"I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’”"
Genesis,32,6,"When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”"
Genesis,32,7,"In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well."
Genesis,32,8,"He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.”"
Genesis,32,9,"Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, LORD, you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’"
Genesis,32,10,"I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps."
Genesis,32,11,"Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children."
Genesis,32,12,"But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”"
Genesis,32,13,"He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:"
Genesis,32,14,"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
Genesis,32,15,"thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys."
Genesis,32,16,"He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”"
Genesis,32,17,"He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’"
Genesis,32,18,"then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’”"
Genesis,32,19,"He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him."
Genesis,32,20,"And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”"
Genesis,32,21,"So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp."
Genesis,32,22,"That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,"After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions."
Genesis,32,24,"So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak."
Genesis,32,25,"When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man."
Genesis,32,26,"Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”"
Genesis,32,27,"The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered."
Genesis,32,28,"Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”"
Genesis,32,29,"Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there."
Genesis,32,30,"So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”"
Genesis,32,31,"The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon."
Genesis,33,1,"Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants."
Genesis,33,2,"He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear."
Genesis,33,3,He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
Genesis,33,4,But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.
Genesis,33,5,"Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked. Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.”"
Genesis,33,6,Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.
Genesis,33,7,"Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?” “To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said."
Genesis,33,9,"But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”"
Genesis,33,10,"“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably."
Genesis,33,11,"Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it."
Genesis,33,12,"Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”"
Genesis,33,13,"But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die."
Genesis,33,14,"So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”"
Genesis,33,15,"Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.” “But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”"
Genesis,33,16,So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
Genesis,33,17,"Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth."
Genesis,33,18,"After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city."
Genesis,33,19,"For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent."
Genesis,33,20,There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
Genesis,34,1,"Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land."
Genesis,34,2,"When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her."
Genesis,34,3,His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
Genesis,34,4,"And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”"
Genesis,34,5,"When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home."
Genesis,34,6,Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
Genesis,34,7,"Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in Israel by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done."
Genesis,34,8,"But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife."
Genesis,34,9,Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.
Genesis,34,10,"You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it.”"
Genesis,34,11,"Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask."
Genesis,34,12,"Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.”"
Genesis,34,13,"Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor."
Genesis,34,14,"They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us."
Genesis,34,15,We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
Genesis,34,16,Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.
Genesis,34,17,"But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.”"
Genesis,34,18,Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
Genesis,34,19,"The young man, who was the most honored of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter."
Genesis,34,20,So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city.
Genesis,34,21,"“These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours."
Genesis,34,22,"But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are."
Genesis,34,23,"Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.”"
Genesis,34,24,"All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised."
Genesis,34,25,"Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male."
Genesis,34,26,They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left.
Genesis,34,27,The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled.
Genesis,34,28,They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.
Genesis,34,29,"They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses."
Genesis,34,30,"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”"
Genesis,34,31,"But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”"
Genesis,35,1,"Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”"
Genesis,35,2,"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes."
Genesis,35,3,"Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”"
Genesis,35,4,"So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them."
Genesis,35,6,"Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,35,7,"There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother."
Genesis,35,8,"Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth."
Genesis,35,9,"After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.” So he named him Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"And God said to him, “I am God Almighty; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants."
Genesis,35,12,"The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”"
Genesis,35,13,Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.
Genesis,35,14,"Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it."
Genesis,35,15,Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.
Genesis,35,16,"Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty."
Genesis,35,17,"And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.”"
Genesis,35,18,As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.
Genesis,35,19,"So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis,35,20,"Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb."
Genesis,35,21,Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
Genesis,35,22,"While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons:"
Genesis,35,23,"The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun."
Genesis,35,24,The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,35,25,The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.
Genesis,35,26,"The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram."
Genesis,35,27,"Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed."
Genesis,35,28,Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.
Genesis,35,29,"Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
Genesis,36,1,"This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom)."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite—"
Genesis,36,3,also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis,36,4,"Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,"
Genesis,36,5,"and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan."
Genesis,36,6,"Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob."
Genesis,36,7,Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.
Genesis,36,8,"So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir."
Genesis,36,9,This is the account of the family line of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,11,"The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,"Esau’s son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah."
Genesis,36,13,"The sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,14,"The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, whom she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam and Korah."
Genesis,36,15,"These were the chiefs among Esau’s descendants: The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,"
Genesis,36,16,"Korah, Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah."
Genesis,36,17,"The sons of Esau’s son Reuel: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,18,"The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah."
Genesis,36,19,"These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs."
Genesis,36,20,"These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
Genesis,36,21,"Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs."
Genesis,36,22,The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam. Timna was Lotan’s sister.
Genesis,36,23,"The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam."
Genesis,36,24,The sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the desert while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
Genesis,36,25,The children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
Genesis,36,26,"The sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran."
Genesis,36,27,"The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan."
Genesis,36,28,The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
Genesis,36,29,"These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
Genesis,36,30,"Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir."
Genesis,36,31,These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned:
Genesis,36,32,Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah.
Genesis,36,33,"When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king."
Genesis,36,34,"When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king."
Genesis,36,35,"When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith."
Genesis,36,36,"When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king."
Genesis,36,37,"When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king."
Genesis,36,38,"When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Akbor succeeded him as king."
Genesis,36,39,"When Baal-Hanan son of Akbor died, Hadad succeeded him as king. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab."
Genesis,36,40,"These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,"
Genesis,36,41,"Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,"
Genesis,36,42,"Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,"
Genesis,36,43,"Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied. This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites."
Genesis,37,1,"Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"This is the account of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them."
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate robe for him."
Genesis,37,4,"When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him."
Genesis,37,5,"Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more."
Genesis,37,6,"He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:"
Genesis,37,7,"We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.”"
Genesis,37,8,"His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said."
Genesis,37,9,"Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”"
Genesis,37,10,"When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”"
Genesis,37,11,"His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind."
Genesis,37,12,"Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,"
Genesis,37,13,"and Israel said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.” “Very well,” he replied."
Genesis,37,14,"So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,"
Genesis,37,15,"a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”"
Genesis,37,16,"He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?”"
Genesis,37,17,"“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him."
Genesis,37,19,“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to each other.
Genesis,37,20,"“Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.”"
Genesis,37,21,"When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said."
Genesis,37,22,"“Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father."
Genesis,37,23,"So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing—"
Genesis,37,24,and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis,37,25,"As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed."
Genesis,37,28,"So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes."
Genesis,37,30,"He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?”"
Genesis,37,31,"Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood."
Genesis,37,32,"They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.”"
Genesis,37,33,"He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.”"
Genesis,37,34,"Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days."
Genesis,37,35,"All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.” So his father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard."
Genesis,38,1,"At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her;
Genesis,38,3,"she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er."
Genesis,38,4,She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.
Genesis,38,5,She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.
Genesis,38,6,"Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the LORD’s sight; so the LORD put him to death."
Genesis,38,8,"Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.”"
Genesis,38,9,"But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother."
Genesis,38,10,What he did was wicked in the LORD’s sight; so the LORD put him to death also.
Genesis,38,11,"Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s household until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, just like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s household."
Genesis,38,12,"After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him."
Genesis,38,13,"When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,”"
Genesis,38,14,"she took off her widow’s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “And what will you give me to sleep with you?” she asked."
Genesis,38,17,"“I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” he said. “Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?” she asked."
Genesis,38,18,"He said, “What pledge should I give you?” “Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him."
Genesis,38,19,"After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes again."
Genesis,38,20,"Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her."
Genesis,38,21,"He asked the men who lived there, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here,” they said."
Genesis,38,22,"So he went back to Judah and said, “I didn’t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, ‘There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.’”"
Genesis,38,23,"Then Judah said, “Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn’t find her.”"
Genesis,38,24,"About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!”"
Genesis,38,25,"As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. “I am pregnant by the man who owns these,” she said. And she added, “See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.”"
Genesis,38,26,"Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not sleep with her again."
Genesis,38,27,"When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, “This one came out first.”"
Genesis,38,29,"But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez."
Genesis,38,30,"Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah."
Genesis,39,1,"Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there."
Genesis,39,2,"The LORD was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master."
Genesis,39,3,"When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD gave him success in everything he did,"
Genesis,39,4,"Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned."
Genesis,39,5,"From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field."
Genesis,39,6,"So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,"
Genesis,39,7,"and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!”"
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused. “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care."
Genesis,39,9,"No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”"
Genesis,39,10,"And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her."
Genesis,39,11,"One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside."
Genesis,39,12,"She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house."
Genesis,39,13,"When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,"
Genesis,39,14,"she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed."
Genesis,39,15,"When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”"
Genesis,39,16,She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
Genesis,39,17,Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
Genesis,39,18,"But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”"
Genesis,39,19,"When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger."
Genesis,39,20,"Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,"
Genesis,39,21,the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
Genesis,39,22,"So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there."
Genesis,39,23,"The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did."
Genesis,40,1,"Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,"
Genesis,40,3,"and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined."
Genesis,40,4,"The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,"
Genesis,40,5,"each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own."
Genesis,40,6,"When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected."
Genesis,40,7,"So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”"
Genesis,40,8,"“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”"
Genesis,40,9,"So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,"
Genesis,40,10,"and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes."
Genesis,40,11,"Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”"
Genesis,40,12,"“This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days."
Genesis,40,13,"Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer."
Genesis,40,14,"But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison."
Genesis,40,15,"I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”"
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread."
Genesis,40,17,"In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”"
Genesis,40,18,"“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days."
Genesis,40,19,Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.”
Genesis,40,20,"Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:"
Genesis,40,21,"He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—"
Genesis,40,22,"but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation."
Genesis,40,23,"The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him."
Genesis,41,1,"When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,"
Genesis,41,2,"when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds."
Genesis,41,3,"After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank."
Genesis,41,4,"And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up."
Genesis,41,5,"He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk."
Genesis,41,6,"After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind."
Genesis,41,7,"The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him."
Genesis,41,9,"Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings."
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard."
Genesis,41,11,"Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own."
Genesis,41,12,"Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream."
Genesis,41,13,"And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.”"
Genesis,41,14,"So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”"
Genesis,41,16,"“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”"
Genesis,41,17,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,"
Genesis,41,18,"when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds."
Genesis,41,19,"After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,20,"The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first."
Genesis,41,21,"But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up."
Genesis,41,22,"“In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk."
Genesis,41,23,"After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind."
Genesis,41,24,"The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.”"
Genesis,41,25,"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do."
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream."
Genesis,41,27,"The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine."
Genesis,41,28,“It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Genesis,41,29,"Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,"
Genesis,41,30,"but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land."
Genesis,41,31,"The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe."
Genesis,41,32,"The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon."
Genesis,41,33,“And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,34,Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
Genesis,41,35,"They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food."
Genesis,41,36,"This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.”"
Genesis,41,37,The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
Genesis,41,38,"So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?”"
Genesis,41,39,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you."
Genesis,41,40,"You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.”"
Genesis,41,41,"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,42,Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
Genesis,41,43,"He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and people shouted before him, “Make way!” Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,45,"Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.
Genesis,41,47,During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.
Genesis,41,48,Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
Genesis,41,49,"Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure."
Genesis,41,50,"Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On."
Genesis,41,51,"Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”"
Genesis,41,52,"The second son he named Ephraim and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”"
Genesis,41,53,"The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food."
Genesis,41,55,"When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”"
Genesis,41,56,"When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere."
Genesis,42,1,"When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”"
Genesis,42,2,"He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”"
Genesis,42,3,Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him."
Genesis,42,5,"So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also."
Genesis,42,6,"Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground."
Genesis,42,7,"As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.”"
Genesis,42,8,"Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”"
Genesis,42,10,"“No, my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food."
Genesis,42,11,"We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”"
Genesis,42,12,“No!” he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”
Genesis,42,13,"But they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”"
Genesis,42,14,"Joseph said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies!"
Genesis,42,15,"And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”"
Genesis,42,17,And he put them all in custody for three days.
Genesis,42,18,"On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:"
Genesis,42,19,"If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households."
Genesis,42,20,"But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to do."
Genesis,42,21,"They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has come on us.”"
Genesis,42,22,"Reuben replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.”"
Genesis,42,23,"They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter."
Genesis,42,24,"He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,"
Genesis,42,26,they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
Genesis,42,27,"At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,42,28,"“My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.” Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”"
Genesis,42,29,"When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,"
Genesis,42,30,“The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.
Genesis,42,31,"But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies."
Genesis,42,32,"We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.’"
Genesis,42,33,"“Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go."
Genesis,42,34,"But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.’”"
Genesis,42,35,"As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened."
Genesis,42,36,"Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!”"
Genesis,42,37,"Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.”"
Genesis,42,38,"But Jacob said, “My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.”"
Genesis,43,1,Now the famine was still severe in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”"
Genesis,43,3,"But Judah said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’"
Genesis,43,4,"If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you."
Genesis,43,5,"But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’”"
Genesis,43,6,"Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?”"
Genesis,43,7,"They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”"
Genesis,43,8,"Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die."
Genesis,43,9,"I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life."
Genesis,43,10,"As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.”"
Genesis,43,11,"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds."
Genesis,43,12,"Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake."
Genesis,43,13,Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.
Genesis,43,14,"And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”"
Genesis,43,15,"So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.”"
Genesis,43,17,The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house.
Genesis,43,18,"Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.”"
Genesis,43,19,So they went up to Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
Genesis,43,20,"“We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food."
Genesis,43,21,But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.
Genesis,43,22,We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.”
Genesis,43,23,"“It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them."
Genesis,43,24,"The steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys."
Genesis,43,25,"They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there."
Genesis,43,26,"When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground."
Genesis,43,27,"He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?”"
Genesis,43,28,"They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him."
Genesis,43,29,"As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”"
Genesis,43,30,"Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there."
Genesis,43,31,"After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the food.”"
Genesis,43,32,"They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians."
Genesis,43,33,"The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment."
Genesis,43,34,"When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him."
Genesis,44,1,"Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,44,2,"Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said."
Genesis,44,3,"As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4,"They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?"
Genesis,44,5,Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.’”
Genesis,44,6,"When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them."
Genesis,44,7,"But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!"
Genesis,44,8,We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
Genesis,44,9,"If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”"
Genesis,44,10,"“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.”"
Genesis,44,11,Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
Genesis,44,12,"Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack."
Genesis,44,13,"At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him."
Genesis,44,15,"Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?”"
Genesis,44,16,“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.”
Genesis,44,17,"But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.”"
Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’"
Genesis,44,20,"And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’"
Genesis,44,21,"“Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’"
Genesis,44,22,"And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’"
Genesis,44,23,"But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’"
Genesis,44,24,"When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said."
Genesis,44,25,"“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’"
Genesis,44,26,"But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’"
Genesis,44,27,"“Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons."
Genesis,44,28,"One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since."
Genesis,44,29,"If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.’"
Genesis,44,30,"“So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life,"
Genesis,44,31,"sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow."
Genesis,44,32,"Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’"
Genesis,44,33,"“Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers."
Genesis,44,34,How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.”
Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it."
Genesis,45,3,"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!"
Genesis,45,5,"And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you."
Genesis,45,6,"For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping."
Genesis,45,7,But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
Genesis,45,8,"“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Now hurry back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay."
Genesis,45,10,"You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have."
Genesis,45,11,"I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.’"
Genesis,45,12,"“You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you."
Genesis,45,13,Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.”
Genesis,45,14,"Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping."
Genesis,45,15,And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
Genesis,45,16,"When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased."
Genesis,45,17,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,"
Genesis,45,18,and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.’
Genesis,45,19,"“You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come."
Genesis,45,20,"Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.’”"
Genesis,45,21,"So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey."
Genesis,45,22,"To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes."
Genesis,45,23,"And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey."
Genesis,45,24,"Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!”"
Genesis,45,25,So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,45,26,"They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.” Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them."
Genesis,45,27,"But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived."
Genesis,45,28,"And Israel said, “I’m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”"
Genesis,46,1,"So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
Genesis,46,2,"And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” he replied."
Genesis,46,3,"“I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there."
Genesis,46,4,"I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.”"
Genesis,46,5,"Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel’s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him."
Genesis,46,6,"So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan."
Genesis,46,7,Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring.
Genesis,46,8,These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.
Genesis,46,9,"The sons of Reuben: Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi."
Genesis,46,10,"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman."
Genesis,46,11,"The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari."
Genesis,46,12,"The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul."
Genesis,46,13,"The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, Jashub and Shimron."
Genesis,46,14,"The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel."
Genesis,46,15,"These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all."
Genesis,46,16,"The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli."
Genesis,46,17,"The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel."
Genesis,46,18,"These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all."
Genesis,46,19,The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,46,20,"In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On."
Genesis,46,21,"The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard."
Genesis,46,22,These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen in all.
Genesis,46,23,The son of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis,46,24,"The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem."
Genesis,46,25,"These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel—seven in all."
Genesis,46,26,"All those who went to Egypt with Jacob—those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons’ wives—numbered sixty-six persons."
Genesis,46,27,"With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family, which went to Egypt, were seventy in all."
Genesis,46,28,"Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,"
Genesis,46,29,"Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time."
Genesis,46,30,"Israel said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.”"
Genesis,46,31,"Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
Genesis,46,32,"The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.’"
Genesis,46,33,"When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’"
Genesis,46,34,"you should answer, ‘Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.”"
Genesis,47,1,"Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,2,He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,"Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?” “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied to Pharaoh, “just as our fathers were.”"
Genesis,47,4,"They also said to him, “We have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants’ flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,5,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you,"
Genesis,47,6,"and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock.”"
Genesis,47,7,"Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh,"
Genesis,47,8,"Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?”"
Genesis,47,9,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.”"
Genesis,47,10,Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
Genesis,47,11,"So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed."
Genesis,47,12,"Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their children."
Genesis,47,13,"There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine."
Genesis,47,14,"Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh’s palace."
Genesis,47,15,"When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone.”"
Genesis,47,16,"“Then bring your livestock,” said Joseph. “I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone.”"
Genesis,47,17,"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock."
Genesis,47,18,"When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land."
Genesis,47,19,"Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.”"
Genesis,47,20,"So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s,"
Genesis,47,21,"and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, from one end of Egypt to the other."
Genesis,47,22,"However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land."
Genesis,47,23,"Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground."
Genesis,47,24,"But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.”"
Genesis,47,25,"“You have saved our lives,” they said. “May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.”"
Genesis,47,26,So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh’s.
Genesis,47,27,Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number.
Genesis,47,28,"Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven."
Genesis,47,29,"When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,"
Genesis,47,30,"but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.” “I will do as you say,” he said."
Genesis,47,31,"“Swear to me,” he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff."
Genesis,48,1,"Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him."
Genesis,48,2,"When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed."
Genesis,48,3,"Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me"
Genesis,48,4,"and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’"
Genesis,48,5,"“Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine."
Genesis,48,6,Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.
Genesis,48,7,"As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis,48,8,"When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?”"
Genesis,48,9,"“They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.”"
Genesis,48,10,"Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them."
Genesis,48,11,"Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.”"
Genesis,48,12,Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
Genesis,48,13,"And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him."
Genesis,48,14,"But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn."
Genesis,48,15,"Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,"
Genesis,48,16,"the Angel who has delivered me from all harm —may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on the earth.”"
Genesis,48,17,When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
Genesis,48,18,"Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”"
Genesis,48,19,"But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.”"
Genesis,48,20,"He blessed them that day and said, “In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh."
Genesis,48,21,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers."
Genesis,48,22,"And to you I give one more ridge of land than to your brothers, the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”"
Genesis,49,1,Then Jacob called for his sons and said: “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
Genesis,49,2,"“Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel."
Genesis,49,3,"“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power."
Genesis,49,4,"Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father’s bed, onto my couch and defiled it."
Genesis,49,5,“Simeon and Levi are brothers— their swords are weapons of violence.
Genesis,49,6,"Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased."
Genesis,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel."
Genesis,49,8,"“Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons will bow down to you."
Genesis,49,9,"You are a lion’s cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?"
Genesis,49,10,"The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his."
Genesis,49,11,"He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes."
Genesis,49,12,"His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk."

Genesis,49,23,With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility.
Genesis,49,24,"But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,"
Genesis,49,25,"because of your father’s God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below, blessings of the breast and womb."
Genesis,49,26,"Your father’s blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers."
Genesis,49,27,"“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.”"
Genesis,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him."
Genesis,49,29,"Then he gave them these instructions: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
Genesis,49,30,"the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite."
Genesis,49,31,"There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah."
Genesis,49,32,The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.”
Genesis,49,33,"When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,50,1,Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis,50,2,"Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,"
Genesis,50,3,"taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days."
Genesis,50,4,"When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,"
Genesis,50,5,"‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’”"
Genesis,50,6,"Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”"
Genesis,50,7,So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt—
Genesis,50,8,besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
Genesis,50,9,Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company.
Genesis,50,10,"When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father."
Genesis,50,11,"When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim."
Genesis,50,12,So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them:
Genesis,50,13,"They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite."
Genesis,50,14,"After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father."
Genesis,50,15,"When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”"
Genesis,50,16,"So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died:"
Genesis,50,17,"‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept."
Genesis,50,18,"His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said."
Genesis,50,19,"But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?"
Genesis,50,20,"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."
Genesis,50,21,"So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them."
Genesis,50,22,"Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years"
Genesis,50,23,and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.
Genesis,50,24,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”"
Genesis,50,25,"And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”"
Genesis,50,26,"So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt."
Exodus,1,1,"These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:"
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;"
Exodus,1,4,Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
Exodus,1,5,The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,"Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,"
Exodus,1,7,"but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt."
Exodus,1,9,"“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us."
Exodus,1,10,"Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”"
Exodus,1,11,"So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites"
Exodus,1,13,and worked them ruthlessly.
Exodus,1,14,They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.
Exodus,1,15,"The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,"
Exodus,1,16,"“When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live."
Exodus,1,18,"Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”"
Exodus,1,20,So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.
Exodus,1,21,"And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own."
Exodus,1,22,"Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”"
Exodus,2,1,"Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman,"
Exodus,2,2,"and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile."
Exodus,2,4,His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,"Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it."
Exodus,2,6,"She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said."
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people."
Exodus,2,12,"Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”"
Exodus,2,14,"The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”"
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock."
Exodus,2,17,"Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,“And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”
Exodus,2,21,"Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage."
Exodus,2,22,"Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God."
Exodus,2,24,"God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
Exodus,3,3,"So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”"
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering."
Exodus,3,8,"So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them."
Exodus,3,10,"So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”"
Exodus,3,15,"God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ “This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation."
Exodus,3,16,"“Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt."
Exodus,3,17,"And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’"
Exodus,3,18,"“The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
Exodus,3,20,"So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go."
Exodus,3,21,"“And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,4,1,"Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you’?”"
Exodus,4,2,"Then the LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied."
Exodus,4,3,"The LORD said, “Throw it on the ground.” Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it."
Exodus,4,4,"Then the LORD said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand."
Exodus,4,5,"“This,” said the LORD, “is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Then the LORD said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow."
Exodus,4,7,"“Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh."
Exodus,4,8,"Then the LORD said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second."
Exodus,4,9,"But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.”"
Exodus,4,10,"Moses said to the LORD, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.”"
Exodus,4,11,"The LORD said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the LORD?"
Exodus,4,12,Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”
Exodus,4,13,"But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.”"
Exodus,4,14,"Then the LORD’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you."
Exodus,4,15,You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
Exodus,4,16,"He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him."
Exodus,4,17,But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.”
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.” Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”"
Exodus,4,19,"Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,"So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"The LORD said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,"
Exodus,4,23,"and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’”"
Exodus,4,24,"At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it. “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said."
Exodus,4,26,"So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)"
Exodus,4,27,"The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform."
Exodus,4,29,"Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,"
Exodus,4,30,"and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,"
Exodus,4,31,"and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’”"
Exodus,5,2,"Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!”"
Exodus,5,5,"Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”"
Exodus,5,6,That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:
Exodus,5,7,“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.
Exodus,5,8,"But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”
Exodus,5,10,"Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
Exodus,5,13,"The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”"
Exodus,5,14,"And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”"
Exodus,5,15,Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?
Exodus,5,16,"Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”"
Exodus,5,17,"Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’"
Exodus,5,18,"Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”"
Exodus,5,20,"When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,"
Exodus,5,21,"and they said, “May the LORD look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.”"
Exodus,6,2,"God also said to Moses, “I am the LORD."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself fully known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners."
Exodus,6,5,"Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment."
Exodus,6,7,"I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.’”"
Exodus,6,9,"Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor."
Exodus,6,10,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.”"
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses said to the LORD, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?”"
Exodus,6,13,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These were the heads of their families: The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei."
Exodus,6,18,"The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri."
Exodus,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans."
Exodus,6,25,"Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan."
Exodus,6,26,"It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.”"
Exodus,6,27,They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,6,28,"Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"he said to him, “I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses said to the LORD, “Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country."
Exodus,7,3,"But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt,"
Exodus,7,4,"he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites."
Exodus,7,5,And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it.”
Exodus,7,6,Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them.
Exodus,7,7,Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.”"
Exodus,7,10,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake."
Exodus,7,11,"Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:"
Exodus,7,12,Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
Exodus,7,13,"Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake."
Exodus,7,16,"Then say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened."
Exodus,7,17,"This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’”"
Exodus,7,19,"The LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone.”"
Exodus,7,20,"Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood."
Exodus,7,21,"The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,23,"Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart."
Exodus,7,24,"And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river."
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
Exodus,8,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
Exodus,8,2,"If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country."
Exodus,8,3,"The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs."
Exodus,8,4,The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’”
Exodus,8,5,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land."
Exodus,8,7,But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,8,"Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,10,"“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God."
Exodus,8,11,"The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,12,"After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.”"
Exodus,8,17,"They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats."
Exodus,8,18,"But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere,"
Exodus,8,19,"the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,20,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
Exodus,8,21,"If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them."
Exodus,8,22,"“‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land."
Exodus,8,23,I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’”
Exodus,8,24,And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.
Exodus,8,25,"Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.”"
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,"We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us.”"
Exodus,8,28,"Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,30,"Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,"
Exodus,8,31,and the LORD did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.
Exodus,8,32,But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
Exodus,9,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.”"
Exodus,9,2,"If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,"
Exodus,9,3,"the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats."
Exodus,9,4,"But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’”"
Exodus,9,5,"The LORD set a time and said, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,"And the next day the LORD did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died."
Exodus,9,7,Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.
Exodus,9,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.”"
Exodus,9,10,"So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals."
Exodus,9,11,The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.
Exodus,9,12,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me,"
Exodus,9,14,"or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
Exodus,9,16,"But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
Exodus,9,18,"Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now."
Exodus,9,19,"Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’”"
Exodus,9,20,Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
Exodus,9,21,But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt;"
Exodus,9,24,hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
Exodus,9,25,Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
Exodus,9,26,"The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were."
Exodus,9,27,"Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong."
Exodus,9,28,"Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.”"
Exodus,9,29,"Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD’s."
Exodus,9,30,But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God.”
Exodus,9,31,"(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom."
Exodus,9,32,"The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)"
Exodus,9,33,"Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land."
Exodus,9,34,"When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts."
Exodus,9,35,"So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them"
Exodus,10,2,"that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
Exodus,10,4,"If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow."
Exodus,10,5,"They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields."
Exodus,10,6,They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?”"
Exodus,10,8,"Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,10,"Pharaoh said, “The LORD be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil."
Exodus,10,11,"No! Have only the men go and worship the LORD, since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence."
Exodus,10,12,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;"
Exodus,10,14,"they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again."
Exodus,10,15,They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
Exodus,10,16,"Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”
Exodus,10,18,Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,21,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days."
Exodus,10,23,No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
Exodus,10,24,"Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.”"
Exodus,10,25,"But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,27,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.”"
Exodus,10,29,"“Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"Now the LORD had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely."
Exodus,11,2,Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”
Exodus,11,3,"(The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.)"
Exodus,11,4,"So Moses said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt."
Exodus,11,5,"Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well."
Exodus,11,6,There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.
Exodus,11,7,But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
Exodus,11,8,"All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh."
Exodus,11,9,"The LORD had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country."
Exodus,12,1,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,"
Exodus,12,2,"“This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year."
Exodus,12,3,"Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household."
Exodus,12,4,"If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat."
Exodus,12,5,"The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats."
Exodus,12,6,"Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight."
Exodus,12,7,Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.
Exodus,12,8,"That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast."
Exodus,12,9,"Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs."
Exodus,12,10,"Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it."
Exodus,12,11,"This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD’s Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"“On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD."
Exodus,12,13,"The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,“This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD—a lasting ordinance.
Exodus,12,15,"For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do."
Exodus,12,17,"“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come."
Exodus,12,18,"In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day."
Exodus,12,19,"For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel."
Exodus,12,20,"Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.”"
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb."
Exodus,12,22,"Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning."
Exodus,12,23,"When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down."
Exodus,12,24,“Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
Exodus,12,25,"When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony."
Exodus,12,26,"And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’"
Exodus,12,27,"then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’” Then the people bowed down and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,29,"At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well."
Exodus,12,30,"Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead."
Exodus,12,31,"During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested."
Exodus,12,32,"Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.”"
Exodus,12,33,"The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!”"
Exodus,12,34,"So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing."
Exodus,12,35,The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.
Exodus,12,36,"The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians."
Exodus,12,37,"The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children."
Exodus,12,38,"Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds."
Exodus,12,39,"With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
Exodus,12,41,"At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD’s divisions left Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come."
Exodus,12,43,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal: “No foreigner may eat it."
Exodus,12,44,"Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him,"
Exodus,12,45,but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it.
Exodus,12,46,“It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
Exodus,12,47,The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
Exodus,12,48,“A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it.
Exodus,12,49,The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.”
Exodus,12,50,All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,51,And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
Exodus,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.”"
Exodus,13,3,"Then Moses said to the people, “Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast."
Exodus,13,4,"Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving."
Exodus,13,5,"When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month:"
Exodus,13,6,For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD.
Exodus,13,7,"Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders."
Exodus,13,8,"On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
Exodus,13,10,You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
Exodus,13,11,"“After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors,"
Exodus,13,12,you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD.
Exodus,13,13,"Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons."
Exodus,13,14,"“In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
Exodus,13,15,"When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’"
Exodus,13,16,And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.”
Exodus,13,17,"When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.
Exodus,13,19,"Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.”"
Exodus,13,20,After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
Exodus,13,21,"By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night."
Exodus,13,22,Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
Exodus,14,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,14,2,"“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,3,"Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’"
Exodus,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So the Israelites did this."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!”"
Exodus,14,6,So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.
Exodus,14,7,"He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them."
Exodus,14,8,"The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD."
Exodus,14,11,"They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”"
Exodus,14,13,"Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again."
Exodus,14,14,The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”
Exodus,14,15,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on."
Exodus,14,16,Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
Exodus,14,17,"I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,"Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,"
Exodus,14,20,coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.
Exodus,14,21,"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,"
Exodus,14,22,"and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left."
Exodus,14,23,"The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea."
Exodus,14,24,During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
Exodus,14,25,"He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt.”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,"Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea."
Exodus,14,28,The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
Exodus,14,29,"But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left."
Exodus,14,30,"That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore."
Exodus,14,31,"And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: “I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"“The LORD is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will exalt him."
Exodus,15,3,The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
Exodus,15,4,Pharaoh’s chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh’s officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"Your right hand, LORD, was majestic in power. Your right hand, LORD, shattered the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,“In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble.
Exodus,15,8,By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood up like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy boasted, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.’"
Exodus,15,10,"But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"Who among the gods is like you, LORD? Who is like you— majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?"
Exodus,15,12,"“You stretch out your right hand, and the earth swallows your enemies."
Exodus,15,13,In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling.
Exodus,15,14,The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
Exodus,15,15,"The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people of Canaan will melt away;"
Exodus,15,16,"terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone— until your people pass by, LORD, until the people you bought pass by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance— the place, LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established."
Exodus,15,18,“The LORD reigns for ever and ever.”
Exodus,15,19,"When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground."
Exodus,15,20,"Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam sang to them: “Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.”"
Exodus,15,22,Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
Exodus,15,23,"When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah.)"
Exodus,15,24,"So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. There the LORD issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test."
Exodus,15,26,"He said, “If you listen carefully to the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water."
Exodus,16,1,"The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,16,3,"The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions."
Exodus,16,5,"On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”"
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,"
Exodus,16,7,"and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?”"
Exodus,16,8,"Moses also said, “You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.’”"
Exodus,16,10,"While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’”"
Exodus,16,13,"That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp."
Exodus,16,14,"When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor."
Exodus,16,15,"When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.’”
Exodus,16,17,"The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little."
Exodus,16,18,"And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed."
Exodus,16,19,"Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away."
Exodus,16,22,"On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"He said to them, “This is what the LORD commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’”"
Exodus,16,24,"So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it."
Exodus,16,25,"“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”"
Exodus,16,27,"Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?"
Exodus,16,29,Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.”
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
Exodus,16,32,"Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,16,33,"So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved."
Exodus,16,35,"The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus,17,1,"The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”"
Exodus,17,5,"The LORD answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go."
Exodus,17,6,"I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.”"
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning."
Exodus,17,12,"When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.”"
Exodus,17,15,Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner.
Exodus,17,16,"He said, “Because hands were lifted up against the throne of the LORD, the LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her"
Exodus,18,3,"and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land”;"
Exodus,18,4,"and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.”"
Exodus,18,5,"Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God."
Exodus,18,6,"Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”"
Exodus,18,7,So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.
Exodus,18,8,Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.
Exodus,18,9,Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,"He said, “Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.”"
Exodus,18,12,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God."
Exodus,18,13,"The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening."
Exodus,18,14,"When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will."
Exodus,18,16,"Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.”"
Exodus,18,17,"Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good."
Exodus,18,18,You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
Exodus,18,19,"Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to him."
Exodus,18,20,"Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave."
Exodus,18,21,"But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens."
Exodus,18,22,"Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.”"
Exodus,18,24,Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
Exodus,18,25,"He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens."
Exodus,18,26,"They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country."
Exodus,19,1,On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai.
Exodus,19,2,"After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:"
Exodus,19,4,"‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,"
Exodus,19,6,you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”
Exodus,19,7,So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.
Exodus,19,8,"The people all responded together, “We will do everything the LORD has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD."
Exodus,19,9,"The LORD said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said."
Exodus,19,10,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes"
Exodus,19,11,"and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."
Exodus,19,12,"Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death."
Exodus,19,13,They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”
Exodus,19,14,"After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”"
Exodus,19,16,"On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,"Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently."
Exodus,19,19,"As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him."
Exodus,19,20,The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up
Exodus,19,21,"and the LORD said to him, “Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish."
Exodus,19,22,"Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’”"
Exodus,19,24,"The LORD replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus,20,1,And God spoke all these words:
Exodus,20,2,"“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
Exodus,20,3,“You shall have no other gods before me.
Exodus,20,4,“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
Exodus,20,5,"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,"
Exodus,20,6,but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
Exodus,20,7,"“You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name."
Exodus,20,8,“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
Exodus,20,9,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns."
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."
Exodus,20,12,"“Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you."
Exodus,20,13,“You shall not murder.
Exodus,20,14,“You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,“You shall not steal.
Exodus,20,16,“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,"“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”"
Exodus,20,18,"When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance"
Exodus,20,19,"and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.”"
Exodus,20,21,"The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites this: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven:"
Exodus,20,23,Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.
Exodus,20,24,"“‘Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it."
Exodus,20,26,"And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.’"
Exodus,21,1,“These are the laws you are to set before them:
Exodus,21,2,"“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything."
Exodus,21,3,"If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free."
Exodus,21,5,"“But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,’"
Exodus,21,6,then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.
Exodus,21,7,"“If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her."
Exodus,21,9,"If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter."
Exodus,21,10,"If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights."
Exodus,21,11,"If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money."
Exodus,21,12,“Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,"However, if it is not done intentionally, but God lets it happen, they are to flee to a place I will designate."
Exodus,21,14,"But if anyone schemes and kills someone deliberately, that person is to be taken from my altar and put to death."
Exodus,21,15,“Anyone who attacks their father or mother is to be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"“Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper’s possession."
Exodus,21,17,“Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,"“If people quarrel and one person hits another with a stone or with their fist and the victim does not die but is confined to bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"the one who struck the blow will not be held liable if the other can get up and walk around outside with a staff; however, the guilty party must pay the injured person for any loss of time and see that the victim is completely healed."
Exodus,21,20,"“Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result,"
Exodus,21,21,"but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property."
Exodus,21,22,"“If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows."
Exodus,21,23,"But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life,"
Exodus,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
Exodus,21,25,"burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."
Exodus,21,26,“An owner who hits a male or female slave in the eye and destroys it must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye.
Exodus,21,27,And an owner who knocks out the tooth of a male or female slave must let the slave go free to compensate for the tooth.
Exodus,21,28,"“If a bull gores a man or woman to death, the bull is to be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible."
Exodus,21,29,"If, however, the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman, the bull is to be stoned and its owner also is to be put to death."
Exodus,21,30,"However, if payment is demanded, the owner may redeem his life by the payment of whatever is demanded."
Exodus,21,31,This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter.
Exodus,21,32,"If the bull gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave, and the bull is to be stoned to death."
Exodus,21,33,"“If anyone uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it,"
Exodus,21,34,the one who opened the pit must pay the owner for the loss and take the dead animal in exchange.
Exodus,21,35,"“If anyone’s bull injures someone else’s bull and it dies, the two parties are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally."

Exodus,29,9,and fasten caps on them. Then tie sashes on Aaron and his sons. The priesthood is theirs by a lasting ordinance. “Then you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.
Exodus,29,10,"“Bring the bull to the front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head."
Exodus,29,11,Slaughter it in the LORD’s presence at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Exodus,29,12,"Take some of the bull’s blood and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar."
Exodus,29,13,"Then take all the fat on the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar."
Exodus,29,14,But burn the bull’s flesh and its hide and its intestines outside the camp. It is a sin offering.
Exodus,29,15,"“Take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head."
Exodus,29,16,Slaughter it and take the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar.
Exodus,29,17,"Cut the ram into pieces and wash the internal organs and the legs, putting them with the head and the other pieces."
Exodus,29,18,"Then burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD."
Exodus,29,19,"“Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head."
Exodus,29,20,"Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then splash blood against the sides of the altar."
Exodus,29,21,And take some blood from the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. Then he and his sons and their garments will be consecrated.
Exodus,29,22,"“Take from this ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat on the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh. (This is the ram for the ordination.)"
Exodus,29,23,"From the basket of bread made without yeast, which is before the LORD, take one round loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf."
Exodus,29,24,Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and have them wave them before the LORD as a wave offering.
Exodus,29,25,"Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar along with the burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to the LORD, a food offering presented to the LORD."
Exodus,29,26,"After you take the breast of the ram for Aaron’s ordination, wave it before the LORD as a wave offering, and it will be your share."
Exodus,29,27,“Consecrate those parts of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons: the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented.
Exodus,29,28,This is always to be the perpetual share from the Israelites for Aaron and his sons. It is the contribution the Israelites are to make to the LORD from their fellowship offerings.
Exodus,29,29,“Aaron’s sacred garments will belong to his descendants so that they can be anointed and ordained in them.
Exodus,29,30,The son who succeeds him as priest and comes to the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place is to wear them seven days.
Exodus,29,31,“Take the ram for the ordination and cook the meat in a sacred place.
Exodus,29,32,"At the entrance to the tent of meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket."
Exodus,29,33,"They are to eat these offerings by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no one else may eat them, because they are sacred."
Exodus,29,34,"And if any of the meat of the ordination ram or any bread is left over till morning, burn it up. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred."
Exodus,29,35,"“Do for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them."
Exodus,29,36,"Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it."
Exodus,29,37,"For seven days make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will be holy."
Exodus,29,38,“This is what you are to offer on the altar regularly each day: two lambs a year old.
Exodus,29,39,Offer one in the morning and the other at twilight.
Exodus,29,40,"With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering."
Exodus,29,41,"Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and its drink offering as in the morning—a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD."
Exodus,29,42,"“For the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the LORD. There I will meet you and speak to you;"
Exodus,29,43,"there also I will meet with the Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory."
Exodus,29,44,“So I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar and will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests.
Exodus,29,45,Then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
Exodus,29,46,"They will know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God."
Exodus,30,1,“Make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense.
Exodus,30,2,"It is to be square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high—its horns of one piece with it."
Exodus,30,3,"Overlay the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it."
Exodus,30,4,Make two gold rings for the altar below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it.
Exodus,30,5,Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
Exodus,30,6,Put the altar in front of the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law—before the atonement cover that is over the tablets of the covenant law—where I will meet with you.
Exodus,30,7,“Aaron must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends the lamps.
Exodus,30,8,He must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so incense will burn regularly before the LORD for the generations to come.
Exodus,30,9,"Do not offer on this altar any other incense or any burnt offering or grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering on it."
Exodus,30,10,Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the atoning sin offering for the generations to come. It is most holy to the LORD.”
Exodus,30,11,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,30,12,"“When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the LORD a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them."
Exodus,30,13,"Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the LORD."
Exodus,30,14,"All who cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering to the LORD."
Exodus,30,15,The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives.
Exodus,30,16,"Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD, making atonement for your lives.”"
Exodus,30,17,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,30,18,"“Make a bronze basin, with its bronze stand, for washing. Place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it."
Exodus,30,19,Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it.
Exodus,30,20,"Whenever they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the LORD,"
Exodus,30,21,they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.”
Exodus,30,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,30,23,"“Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant calamus,"
Exodus,30,24,500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil.
Exodus,30,25,"Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil."
Exodus,30,26,"Then use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law,"
Exodus,30,27,"the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,"
Exodus,30,28,"the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand."
Exodus,30,29,"You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy."
Exodus,30,30,“Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.
Exodus,30,31,"Say to the Israelites, ‘This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come."
Exodus,30,32,"Do not pour it on anyone else’s body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred."
Exodus,30,33,Whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.’”
Exodus,30,34,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,"
Exodus,30,35,"and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred."
Exodus,30,36,"Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you."
Exodus,30,37,Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the LORD.
Exodus,30,38,Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.”
Exodus,31,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,31,2,"“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,"
Exodus,31,3,"and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—"
Exodus,31,4,"to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,"
Exodus,31,5,"to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts."
Exodus,31,6,"Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you:"
Exodus,31,7,"the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—"
Exodus,31,8,"the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,"
Exodus,31,9,"the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand—"
Exodus,31,10,"and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,"
Exodus,31,11,and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.”
Exodus,31,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Exodus,31,13,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy."
Exodus,31,14,"“‘Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people."
Exodus,31,15,"For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death."
Exodus,31,16,"The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant."
Exodus,31,17,"It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”"
Exodus,31,18,"When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God."
Exodus,32,1,"When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”"
Exodus,32,3,So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,32,5,"When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD.”"
Exodus,32,6,So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
Exodus,32,7,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt."
Exodus,32,8,"They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,32,9,"“I have seen these people,” the LORD said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people."
Exodus,32,10,Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
Exodus,32,11,"But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. “LORD,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
Exodus,32,15,"Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back."
Exodus,32,16,"The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets."
Exodus,32,17,"When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,"Moses replied: “It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.”"
Exodus,32,19,"When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,"And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it."
Exodus,32,21,"He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”"
Exodus,32,22,"“Do not be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil."
Exodus,32,23,"They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’"
Exodus,32,24,"So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”"
Exodus,32,25,Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.
Exodus,32,26,"So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him."
Exodus,32,27,"Then he said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’”"
Exodus,32,28,"The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died."
Exodus,32,29,"Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.”"
Exodus,32,30,"The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses went back to the LORD and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold."
Exodus,32,32,"But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.”"
Exodus,32,33,"The LORD replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book."
Exodus,32,34,"Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
Exodus,33,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’"
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
Exodus,33,3,"Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments."
Exodus,33,5,"For the LORD had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.’”"
Exodus,33,6,So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
Exodus,33,7,"Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent."
Exodus,33,11,"The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the LORD, “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favor with me.’"
Exodus,33,13,"If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.”"
Exodus,33,14,"The LORD replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”"
Exodus,33,15,"Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here."
Exodus,33,16,How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
Exodus,33,17,"And the LORD said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”"
Exodus,33,18,"Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”"
Exodus,33,19,"And the LORD said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
Exodus,33,20,"But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”"
Exodus,33,21,"Then the LORD said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock."
Exodus,33,22,"When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”
Exodus,34,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke."
Exodus,34,2,"Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain."
Exodus,34,3,No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.”
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands."
Exodus,34,5,"Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD."
Exodus,34,6,"And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,"
Exodus,34,7,"maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”"
Exodus,34,8,Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.
Exodus,34,9,"“Lord,” he said, “if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.”"
Exodus,34,10,"Then the LORD said: “I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the LORD, will do for you."
Exodus,34,11,"Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites."
Exodus,34,12,"Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you."
Exodus,34,13,"Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles."
Exodus,34,14,"Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God."
Exodus,34,15,"“Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices."
Exodus,34,16,"And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same."
Exodus,34,17,“Do not make any idols.
Exodus,34,18,"“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,"“The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock."
Exodus,34,20,"Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. “No one is to appear before me empty-handed."
Exodus,34,21,"“Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest."
Exodus,34,22,"“Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year."
Exodus,34,23,"Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,"I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God."
Exodus,34,25,"“Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning."
Exodus,34,26,“Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. “Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
Exodus,34,27,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”"
Exodus,34,28,Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.
Exodus,34,29,"When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD."
Exodus,34,30,"When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him."
Exodus,34,31,"But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them."
Exodus,34,32,"Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face."
Exodus,34,34,"But whenever he entered the LORD’s presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,"
Exodus,34,35,they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.
Exodus,35,1,"Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do:"
Exodus,35,2,"For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death."
Exodus,35,3,Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
Exodus,35,4,"Moses said to the whole Israelite community, “This is what the LORD has commanded:"
Exodus,35,5,"From what you have, take an offering for the LORD. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the LORD an offering of gold, silver and bronze;"
Exodus,35,6,"blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;"
Exodus,35,7,ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather; acacia wood;
Exodus,35,8,olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
Exodus,35,9,and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,“All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the LORD has commanded:
Exodus,35,11,"the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;"
Exodus,35,12,the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it;
Exodus,35,13,the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
Exodus,35,14,"the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light;"
Exodus,35,15,"the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;"
Exodus,35,16,"the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;"
Exodus,35,17,"the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;"
Exodus,35,18,"the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;"
Exodus,35,19,the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.”
Exodus,35,20,"Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses’ presence,"
Exodus,35,21,"and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments."
Exodus,35,22,"All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD."
Exodus,35,23,"Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or the other durable leather brought them."
Exodus,35,24,"Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it."
Exodus,35,25,"Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen."
Exodus,35,26,And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.
Exodus,35,27,The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
Exodus,35,28,They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
Exodus,35,29,All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do.
Exodus,35,30,"Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,"
Exodus,35,31,"and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—"
Exodus,35,32,"to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,"
Exodus,35,33,"to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts."
Exodus,35,34,"And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others."
Exodus,35,35,"He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers."
Exodus,36,1,"So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the LORD has commanded.”"
Exodus,36,2,Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.
Exodus,36,3,They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
Exodus,36,4,So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing
Exodus,36,5,"and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD commanded to be done.”"
Exodus,36,6,"Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more,"
Exodus,36,7,because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.
Exodus,36,8,"All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands."
Exodus,36,9,All the curtains were the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.
Exodus,36,10,They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.
Exodus,36,11,"Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set."
Exodus,36,12,"They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other."
Exodus,36,13,Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.
Exodus,36,14,They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether.
Exodus,36,15,All eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
Exodus,36,16,They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.
Exodus,36,17,Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
Exodus,36,18,They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.
Exodus,36,19,"Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather."
Exodus,36,20,They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,21,"Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,"
Exodus,36,22,with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
Exodus,36,23,They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle
Exodus,36,24,"and made forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection."
Exodus,36,25,"For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames"
Exodus,36,26,and forty silver bases—two under each frame.
Exodus,36,27,"They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,"
Exodus,36,28,and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.
Exodus,36,29,At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.
Exodus,36,30,So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
Exodus,36,31,"They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,"
Exodus,36,32,"five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle."
Exodus,36,33,They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames.
Exodus,36,34,They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
Exodus,36,35,"They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker."
Exodus,36,36,They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases.
Exodus,36,37,"For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer;"
Exodus,36,38,and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.
Exodus,37,1,"Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high."
Exodus,37,2,"He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it."
Exodus,37,3,"He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other."
Exodus,37,4,Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus,37,5,And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
Exodus,37,6,He made the atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
Exodus,37,7,Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
Exodus,37,8,He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.
Exodus,37,9,"The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover."
Exodus,37,10,"They made the table of acacia wood—two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high."
Exodus,37,11,Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
Exodus,37,12,They also made around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
Exodus,37,13,"They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were."
Exodus,37,14,The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.
Exodus,37,15,The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold.
Exodus,37,16,And they made from pure gold the articles for the table—its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.
Exodus,37,17,"They made the lampstand of pure gold. They hammered out its base and shaft, and made its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them."
Exodus,37,18,Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
Exodus,37,19,"Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand."
Exodus,37,20,And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
Exodus,37,21,"One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all."
Exodus,37,22,"The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold."
Exodus,37,23,"They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold."
Exodus,37,24,They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent of pure gold.
Exodus,37,25,"They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high—its horns of one piece with it."
Exodus,37,26,"They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it."
Exodus,37,27,They made two gold rings below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it.
Exodus,37,28,They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus,37,29,"They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense—the work of a perfumer."
Exodus,38,1,"They built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide."
Exodus,38,2,"They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze."
Exodus,38,3,"They made all its utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans."
Exodus,38,4,"They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar."
Exodus,38,5,They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating.
Exodus,38,6,They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
Exodus,38,7,"They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards."
Exodus,38,8,They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Exodus,38,9,"Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits long and had curtains of finely twisted linen,"
Exodus,38,10,"with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts."
Exodus,38,11,"The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts."
Exodus,38,12,"The west end was fifty cubits wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts."
Exodus,38,13,"The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide."
Exodus,38,14,"Curtains fifteen cubits long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases,"
Exodus,38,15,"and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases."
Exodus,38,16,All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen.
Exodus,38,17,"The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands."
Exodus,38,18,"The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,"
Exodus,38,19,"with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver."
Exodus,38,20,All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
Exodus,38,21,"These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest."
Exodus,38,22,"(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the LORD commanded Moses;"
Exodus,38,23,"with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan—an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.)"
Exodus,38,24,"The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel."
Exodus,38,25,"The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel—"
Exodus,38,26,"one beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men."
Exodus,38,27,"The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base."
Exodus,38,28,"They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands."
Exodus,38,29,"The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels."
Exodus,38,30,"They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils,"
Exodus,38,31,the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard.
Exodus,39,1,"From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,2,"They made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen."
Exodus,39,3,"They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen—the work of skilled hands."
Exodus,39,4,"They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened."
Exodus,39,5,"Its skillfully woven waistband was like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,6,They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.
Exodus,39,7,"Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,8,"They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen."
Exodus,39,9,It was square—a span long and a span wide—and folded double.
Exodus,39,10,"Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl;"
Exodus,39,11,"the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald;"
Exodus,39,12,"the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst;"
Exodus,39,13,"the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree settings."
Exodus,39,14,"There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes."
Exodus,39,15,"For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope."
Exodus,39,16,"They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece."
Exodus,39,17,"They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,"
Exodus,39,18,"and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front."
Exodus,39,19,They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.
Exodus,39,20,"Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod."
Exodus,39,21,"They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,22,They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver—
Exodus,39,23,"with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear."
Exodus,39,24,"They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe."
Exodus,39,25,And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.
Exodus,39,26,"The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,27,"For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver—"
Exodus,39,28,"and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen."
Exodus,39,29,"The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,30,"They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD."
Exodus,39,31,"Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,32,"So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,33,"Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;"
Exodus,39,34,the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of another durable leather and the shielding curtain;
Exodus,39,35,the ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover;
Exodus,39,36,the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
Exodus,39,37,"the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light;"
Exodus,39,38,"the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;"
Exodus,39,39,"the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;"
Exodus,39,40,"the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;"
Exodus,39,41,"and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests."
Exodus,39,42,The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus,39,43,Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
Exodus,40,1,Then the LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,40,2,"“Set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month."
Exodus,40,3,Place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain.
Exodus,40,4,Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
Exodus,40,5,Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the covenant law and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
Exodus,40,6,"“Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;"
Exodus,40,7,place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.
Exodus,40,8,Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
Exodus,40,9,"“Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy."
Exodus,40,10,"Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy."
Exodus,40,11,Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
Exodus,40,12,“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
Exodus,40,13,"Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest."
Exodus,40,14,Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
Exodus,40,15,"Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.”"
Exodus,40,16,Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.
Exodus,40,17,So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.
Exodus,40,18,"When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts."
Exodus,40,19,"Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,40,20,"He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it."
Exodus,40,21,"Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,40,22,Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain
Exodus,40,23,"and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,40,24,He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
Exodus,40,25,"and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,40,26,Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain
Exodus,40,27,"and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,40,28,Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
Exodus,40,29,"He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,40,30,"He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,"
Exodus,40,31,and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.
Exodus,40,32,"They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,33,Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.
Exodus,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,35,"Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,36,"In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;"
Exodus,40,37,"but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted."
Exodus,40,38,"So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels."
Leviticus,1,1,"The LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said,"
Leviticus,1,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When anyone among you brings an offering to the LORD, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock."
Leviticus,1,3,"“‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you are to offer a male without defect. You must present it at the entrance to the tent of meeting so that it will be acceptable to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,4,"You are to lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on your behalf to make atonement for you."
Leviticus,1,5,"You are to slaughter the young bull before the LORD, and then Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,1,6,You are to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
Leviticus,1,7,The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
Leviticus,1,8,"Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar."
Leviticus,1,9,"You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,10,"“‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the flock, from either the sheep or the goats, you are to offer a male without defect."
Leviticus,1,11,"You are to slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,1,12,"You are to cut it into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar."
Leviticus,1,13,"You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to bring all of them and burn them on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,14,"“‘If the offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, you are to offer a dove or a young pigeon."
Leviticus,1,15,"The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar."
Leviticus,1,16,He is to remove the crop and the feathers and throw them down east of the altar where the ashes are.
Leviticus,1,17,"He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,1,"“‘When anyone brings a grain offering to the LORD, their offering is to be of the finest flour. They are to pour olive oil on it, put incense on it"
Leviticus,2,2,"and take it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,3,The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the LORD.
Leviticus,2,4,"“‘If you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to consist of the finest flour: either thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in or thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with olive oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it is to be made of the finest flour mixed with oil, and without yeast."
Leviticus,2,6,Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,7,"If your grain offering is cooked in a pan, it is to be made of the finest flour and some olive oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"Bring the grain offering made of these things to the LORD; present it to the priest, who shall take it to the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"He shall take out the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,10,The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the LORD.
Leviticus,2,11,"“‘Every grain offering you bring to the LORD must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,12,"You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of the firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma."
Leviticus,2,13,Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings.
Leviticus,2,14,"“‘If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire."
Leviticus,2,15,Put oil and incense on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,16,"The priest shall burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all the incense, as a food offering presented to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,1,"“‘If your offering is a fellowship offering, and you offer an animal from the herd, whether male or female, you are to present before the LORD an animal without defect."
Leviticus,3,2,You are to lay your hand on the head of your offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash the blood against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,3,"From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the LORD: the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them,"
Leviticus,3,4,"both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,5,"Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering that is lying on the burning wood; it is a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,6,"“‘If you offer an animal from the flock as a fellowship offering to the LORD, you are to offer a male or female without defect."
Leviticus,3,7,"If you offer a lamb, you are to present it before the LORD,"
Leviticus,3,8,lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,9,"From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the LORD: its fat, the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them,"
Leviticus,3,10,"both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,11,The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to the LORD.
Leviticus,3,12,"“‘If your offering is a goat, you are to present it before the LORD,"
Leviticus,3,13,lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,14,"From what you offer you are to present this food offering to the LORD: the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them,"
Leviticus,3,15,"both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,16,"The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering, a pleasing aroma. All the fat is the LORD’s."
Leviticus,3,17,"“‘This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live: You must not eat any fat or any blood.’”"
Leviticus,4,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,4,2,“Say to the Israelites: ‘When anyone sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands—
Leviticus,4,3,"“‘If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the LORD a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed."
Leviticus,4,4,He is to present the bull at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD. He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it there before the LORD.
Leviticus,4,5,Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,6,"He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,4,7,The priest shall then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. The rest of the bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,8,"He shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—all the fat that is connected to the internal organs,"
Leviticus,4,9,"both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys—"
Leviticus,4,10,just as the fat is removed from the ox sacrificed as a fellowship offering. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,11,"But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, as well as the head and legs, the internal organs and the intestines—"
Leviticus,4,12,"that is, all the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a place ceremonially clean, where the ashes are thrown, and burn it there in a wood fire on the ash heap."
Leviticus,4,13,"“‘If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands, even though the community is unaware of the matter, when they realize their guilt"
Leviticus,4,14,"and the sin they committed becomes known, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,4,15,"The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the LORD, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD."
Leviticus,4,16,Then the anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood into the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,17,He shall dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it before the LORD seven times in front of the curtain.
Leviticus,4,18,He is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,19,"He shall remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar,"
Leviticus,4,20,"and do with this bull just as he did with the bull for the sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the community, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,21,Then he shall take the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering for the community.
Leviticus,4,22,"“‘When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the commands of the LORD his God, when he realizes his guilt"
Leviticus,4,23,"and the sin he has committed becomes known, he must bring as his offering a male goat without defect."
Leviticus,4,24,He is to lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering.
Leviticus,4,25,Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,26,"He shall burn all the fat on the altar as he burned the fat of the fellowship offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the leader’s sin, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,27,"“‘If any member of the community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands, when they realize their guilt"
Leviticus,4,28,"and the sin they have committed becomes known, they must bring as their offering for the sin they committed a female goat without defect."
Leviticus,4,29,They are to lay their hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,30,Then the priest is to take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,31,"They shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,32,"“‘If someone brings a lamb as their sin offering, they are to bring a female without defect."
Leviticus,4,33,They are to lay their hand on its head and slaughter it for a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
Leviticus,4,34,Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,35,"They shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the lamb of the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar on top of the food offerings presented to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for them for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,1,"“‘If anyone sins because they do not speak up when they hear a public charge to testify regarding something they have seen or learned about, they will be held responsible."
Leviticus,5,2,"“‘If anyone becomes aware that they are guilty—if they unwittingly touch anything ceremonially unclean (whether the carcass of an unclean animal, wild or domestic, or of any unclean creature that moves along the ground) and they are unaware that they have become unclean, but then they come to realize their guilt;"
Leviticus,5,3,"or if they touch human uncleanness (anything that would make them unclean) even though they are unaware of it, but then they learn of it and realize their guilt;"
Leviticus,5,4,"or if anyone thoughtlessly takes an oath to do anything, whether good or evil (in any matter one might carelessly swear about) even though they are unaware of it, but then they learn of it and realize their guilt—"
Leviticus,5,5,"when anyone becomes aware that they are guilty in any of these matters, they must confess in what way they have sinned."
Leviticus,5,6,"As a penalty for the sin they have committed, they must bring to the LORD a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for them for their sin."
Leviticus,5,7,“‘Anyone who cannot afford a lamb is to bring two doves or two young pigeons to the LORD as a penalty for their sin—one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,5,8,"They are to bring them to the priest, who shall first offer the one for the sin offering. He is to wring its head from its neck, not dividing it completely,"
Leviticus,5,9,and is to splash some of the blood of the sin offering against the side of the altar; the rest of the blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
Leviticus,5,10,"The priest shall then offer the other as a burnt offering in the prescribed way and make atonement for them for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,11,"“‘If, however, they cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, they are to bring as an offering for their sin a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour for a sin offering. They must not put olive oil or incense on it, because it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"They are to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar on top of the food offerings presented to the LORD. It is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,13,"In this way the priest will make atonement for them for any of these sins they have committed, and they will be forgiven. The rest of the offering will belong to the priest, as in the case of the grain offering.’”"
Leviticus,5,14,The LORD said to Moses:
Leviticus,5,15,"“When anyone is unfaithful to the LORD by sinning unintentionally in regard to any of the LORD’s holy things, they are to bring to the LORD as a penalty a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. It is a guilt offering."
Leviticus,5,16,"They must make restitution for what they have failed to do in regard to the holy things, pay an additional penalty of a fifth of its value and give it all to the priest. The priest will make atonement for them with the ram as a guilt offering, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,17,"“If anyone sins and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands, even though they do not know it, they are guilty and will be held responsible."
Leviticus,5,18,"They are to bring to the priest as a guilt offering a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value. In this way the priest will make atonement for them for the wrong they have committed unintentionally, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a guilt offering; they have been guilty of wrongdoing against the LORD.”
Leviticus,6,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Leviticus,6,2,"“If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the LORD by deceiving a neighbor about something entrusted to them or left in their care or about something stolen, or if they cheat their neighbor,"
Leviticus,6,3,"or if they find lost property and lie about it, or if they swear falsely about any such sin that people may commit—"
Leviticus,6,4,"when they sin in any of these ways and realize their guilt, they must return what they have stolen or taken by extortion, or what was entrusted to them, or the lost property they found,"
Leviticus,6,5,"or whatever it was they swore falsely about. They must make restitution in full, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the owner on the day they present their guilt offering."
Leviticus,6,6,"And as a penalty they must bring to the priest, that is, to the LORD, their guilt offering, a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value."
Leviticus,6,7,"In this way the priest will make atonement for them before the LORD, and they will be forgiven for any of the things they did that made them guilty.”"
Leviticus,6,8,The LORD said to Moses:
Leviticus,6,9,"“Give Aaron and his sons this command: ‘These are the regulations for the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the altar hearth throughout the night, till morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar."
Leviticus,6,10,"The priest shall then put on his linen clothes, with linen undergarments next to his body, and shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,"Then he is to take off these clothes and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean."
Leviticus,6,12,The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest is to add firewood and arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat of the fellowship offerings on it.
Leviticus,6,13,The fire must be kept burning on the altar continuously; it must not go out.
Leviticus,6,14,"“‘These are the regulations for the grain offering: Aaron’s sons are to bring it before the LORD, in front of the altar."
Leviticus,6,15,"The priest is to take a handful of the finest flour and some olive oil, together with all the incense on the grain offering, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,16,"Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest of it, but it is to be eaten without yeast in the sanctuary area; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,6,17,"It must not be baked with yeast; I have given it as their share of the food offerings presented to me. Like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is most holy."
Leviticus,6,18,Any male descendant of Aaron may eat it. For all generations to come it is his perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the LORD. Whatever touches them will become holy.’”
Leviticus,6,19,"The LORD also said to Moses,"
Leviticus,6,20,"“This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to bring to the LORD on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening."
Leviticus,6,21,It must be prepared with oil on a griddle; bring it well-mixed and present the grain offering broken in pieces as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
Leviticus,6,22,The son who is to succeed him as anointed priest shall prepare it. It is the LORD’s perpetual share and is to be burned completely.
Leviticus,6,23,Every grain offering of a priest shall be burned completely; it must not be eaten.”
Leviticus,6,24,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,6,25,“Say to Aaron and his sons: ‘These are the regulations for the sin offering: The sin offering is to be slaughtered before the LORD in the place the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest who offers it shall eat it; it is to be eaten in the sanctuary area, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,6,27,"Whatever touches any of the flesh will become holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you must wash it in the sanctuary area."
Leviticus,6,28,"The clay pot the meat is cooked in must be broken; but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot is to be scoured and rinsed with water."
Leviticus,6,29,Any male in a priest’s family may eat it; it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,30,But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned up.
Leviticus,7,1,"“‘These are the regulations for the guilt offering, which is most holy:"
Leviticus,7,2,"The guilt offering is to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and its blood is to be splashed against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"All its fat shall be offered: the fat tail and the fat that covers the internal organs,"
Leviticus,7,4,"both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys."
Leviticus,7,5,The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to the LORD. It is a guilt offering.
Leviticus,7,6,"Any male in a priest’s family may eat it, but it must be eaten in the sanctuary area; it is most holy."
Leviticus,7,7,“‘The same law applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering: They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.
Leviticus,7,8,The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep its hide for himself.
Leviticus,7,9,"Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it,"
Leviticus,7,10,"and every grain offering, whether mixed with olive oil or dry, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron."
Leviticus,7,11,“‘These are the regulations for the fellowship offering anyone may present to the LORD:
Leviticus,7,12,"“‘If they offer it as an expression of thankfulness, then along with this thank offering they are to offer thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in, thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with oil, and thick loaves of the finest flour well-kneaded and with oil mixed in."
Leviticus,7,13,Along with their fellowship offering of thanksgiving they are to present an offering with thick loaves of bread made with yeast.
Leviticus,7,14,"They are to bring one of each kind as an offering, a contribution to the LORD; it belongs to the priest who splashes the blood of the fellowship offering against the altar."
Leviticus,7,15,The meat of their fellowship offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it is offered; they must leave none of it till morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"“‘If, however, their offering is the result of a vow or is a freewill offering, the sacrifice shall be eaten on the day they offer it, but anything left over may be eaten on the next day."
Leviticus,7,17,Any meat of the sacrifice left over till the third day must be burned up.
Leviticus,7,18,"If any meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, the one who offered it will not be accepted. It will not be reckoned to their credit, for it has become impure; the person who eats any of it will be held responsible."
Leviticus,7,19,"“‘Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it."
Leviticus,7,20,"But if anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD, they must be cut off from their people."
Leviticus,7,21,Anyone who touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean creature that moves along the ground—and then eats any of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD must be cut off from their people.’”
Leviticus,7,22,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,7,23,"“Say to the Israelites: ‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats."
Leviticus,7,24,"The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it."
Leviticus,7,25,Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be presented to the LORD must be cut off from their people.
Leviticus,7,26,"And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal."
Leviticus,7,27,Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from their people.’”
Leviticus,7,28,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,7,29,“Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to the LORD is to bring part of it as their sacrifice to the LORD.
Leviticus,7,30,"With their own hands they are to present the food offering to the LORD; they are to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before the LORD as a wave offering."
Leviticus,7,31,"The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons."
Leviticus,7,32,You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
Leviticus,7,33,The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share.
Leviticus,7,34,"From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual share from the Israelites.’”"
Leviticus,7,35,This is the portion of the food offerings presented to the LORD that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.
Leviticus,7,36,"On the day they were anointed, the LORD commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come."
Leviticus,7,37,"These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering,"
Leviticus,7,38,which the LORD gave Moses at Mount Sinai in the Desert of Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the LORD.
Leviticus,8,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,8,2,"“Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast,"
Leviticus,8,3,and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”
Leviticus,8,4,"Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,8,5,"Moses said to the assembly, “This is what the LORD has commanded to be done.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
Leviticus,8,7,"He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him."
Leviticus,8,8,He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
Leviticus,8,9,"Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of it, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,"Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them."
Leviticus,8,11,"He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them."
Leviticus,8,12,He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.
Leviticus,8,13,"Then he brought Aaron’s sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,"He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,15,"Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it."
Leviticus,8,16,"Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,"He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,19,Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.
Leviticus,8,20,"He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat."
Leviticus,8,21,"He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,23,"Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,8,25,"After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,26,"And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the LORD, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,27,"He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the LORD as a wave offering."
Leviticus,8,28,"Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,29,"Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,30,Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.
Leviticus,8,31,"Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’"
Leviticus,8,32,Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.
Leviticus,8,33,"Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days."
Leviticus,8,34,What has been done today was commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you.
Leviticus,8,35,"You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and do what the LORD requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded.”"
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
Leviticus,9,2,"He said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for your sin offering and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,3,"Then say to the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without defect—for a burnt offering,"
Leviticus,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the LORD, together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.’”"
Leviticus,9,5,"They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,6,"Then Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
Leviticus,9,9,"His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,9,10,"On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD commanded Moses;"
Leviticus,9,11,the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus,9,15,Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
Leviticus,9,16,He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.
Leviticus,9,17,"He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering."
Leviticus,9,18,"He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"But the fat portions of the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver—"
Leviticus,9,20,"these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar."
Leviticus,9,21,"Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the LORD as a wave offering, as Moses commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down."
Leviticus,9,23,"Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown."
Leviticus,10,1,"Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command."
Leviticus,10,2,"So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,3,"Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD spoke of when he said: “‘Among those who approach me I will be proved holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.’” Aaron remained silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.”"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered."
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become unkempt and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the LORD will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the LORD has destroyed by fire."
Leviticus,10,7,"Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said."
Leviticus,10,8,"Then the LORD said to Aaron,"
Leviticus,10,9,"“You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come,"
Leviticus,10,10,"so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean,"
Leviticus,10,11,and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has given them through Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12,"Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the LORD and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy."
Leviticus,10,13,"Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings presented to the LORD; for so I have been commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings.
Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the LORD as a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children, as the LORD has commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,16,"When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked,"
Leviticus,10,17,“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the LORD.
Leviticus,10,18,"Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,19,"Aaron replied to Moses, “Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the LORD have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?”"
Leviticus,10,20,"When Moses heard this, he was satisfied."
Leviticus,11,1,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Leviticus,11,2,"“Say to the Israelites: ‘Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat:"
Leviticus,11,3,You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud.
Leviticus,11,4,"“‘There are some that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,5,"The hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,6,"The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,7,"And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,8,You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.
Leviticus,11,9,“‘Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales.
Leviticus,11,10,But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water—you are to regard as unclean.
Leviticus,11,11,"And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat; you must regard their carcasses as unclean."
Leviticus,11,12,Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as unclean by you.
Leviticus,11,13,"“‘These are the birds you are to regard as unclean and not eat because they are unclean: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,"
Leviticus,11,14,"the red kite, any kind of black kite,"
Leviticus,11,15,"any kind of raven,"
Leviticus,11,16,"the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,"
Leviticus,11,17,"the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,"
Leviticus,11,18,"the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,"
Leviticus,11,19,"the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,“‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be regarded as unclean by you.
Leviticus,11,21,"There are, however, some flying insects that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground."
Leviticus,11,22,"Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper."
Leviticus,11,23,But all other flying insects that have four legs you are to regard as unclean.
Leviticus,11,24,“‘You will make yourselves unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening.
Leviticus,11,25,"Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,11,26,“‘Every animal that does not have a divided hoof or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them will be unclean.
Leviticus,11,27,"Of all the animals that walk on all fours, those that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,11,28,"Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening. These animals are unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,29,"“‘Of the animals that move along the ground, these are unclean for you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard,"
Leviticus,11,30,"the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon."
Leviticus,11,31,"Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,11,32,"When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean."
Leviticus,11,33,"If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean, and you must break the pot."
Leviticus,11,34,"Any food you are allowed to eat that has come into contact with water from any such pot is unclean, and any liquid that is drunk from such a pot is unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them as unclean."
Leviticus,11,36,"A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,39,"“‘If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,11,40,"Anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,11,41,“‘Every creature that moves along the ground is to be regarded as unclean; it is not to be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,"You are not to eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet; it is unclean."
Leviticus,11,43,Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them.
Leviticus,11,44,"I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves along the ground."
Leviticus,11,45,"I am the LORD, who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy."
Leviticus,11,46,"“‘These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves about in the water and every creature that moves along the ground."
Leviticus,11,47,"You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.’”"
Leviticus,12,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,12,2,"“Say to the Israelites: ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period."
Leviticus,12,3,On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.
Leviticus,12,5,"If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding."
Leviticus,12,6,"“‘When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering."
Leviticus,12,7,"He shall offer them before the LORD to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood. “‘These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl."
Leviticus,12,8,"But if she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”"
Leviticus,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Leviticus,13,2,"“When anyone has a swelling or a rash or a shiny spot on their skin that may be a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who is a priest."
Leviticus,13,3,"The priest is to examine the sore on the skin, and if the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling skin disease. When the priest examines that person, he shall pronounce them ceremonially unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"On the seventh day the priest is to examine them, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread in the skin, he is to isolate them for another seven days."
Leviticus,13,6,"On the seventh day the priest is to examine them again, and if the sore has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a rash. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the rash does spread in their skin after they have shown themselves to the priest to be pronounced clean, they must appear before the priest again."
Leviticus,13,8,"The priest is to examine that person, and if the rash has spread in the skin, he shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease."
Leviticus,13,9,"“When anyone has a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,"The priest is to examine them, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and if there is raw flesh in the swelling,"
Leviticus,13,11,"it is a chronic skin disease and the priest shall pronounce them unclean. He is not to isolate them, because they are already unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"“If the disease breaks out all over their skin and, so far as the priest can see, it covers all the skin of the affected person from head to foot,"
Leviticus,13,13,"the priest is to examine them, and if the disease has covered their whole body, he shall pronounce them clean. Since it has all turned white, they are clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But whenever raw flesh appears on them, they will be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"When the priest sees the raw flesh, he shall pronounce them unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; they have a defiling disease."
Leviticus,13,16,"If the raw flesh changes and turns white, they must go to the priest."
Leviticus,13,17,"The priest is to examine them, and if the sores have turned white, the priest shall pronounce the affected person clean; then they will be clean."
Leviticus,13,18,"“When someone has a boil on their skin and it heals,"
Leviticus,13,19,"and in the place where the boil was, a white swelling or reddish-white spot appears, they must present themselves to the priest."
Leviticus,13,20,"The priest is to examine it, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce that person unclean. It is a defiling skin disease that has broken out where the boil was."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if, when the priest examines it, there is no white hair in it and it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days."
Leviticus,13,22,"If it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling disease."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the spot is unchanged and has not spread, it is only a scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce them clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"“When someone has a burn on their skin and a reddish-white or white spot appears in the raw flesh of the burn,"
Leviticus,13,25,"the priest is to examine the spot, and if the hair in it has turned white, and it appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and if it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days."
Leviticus,13,27,"On the seventh day the priest is to examine that person, and if it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease."
Leviticus,13,28,"If, however, the spot is unchanged and has not spread in the skin but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a scar from the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,"“If a man or woman has a sore on their head or chin,"
Leviticus,13,30,"the priest is to examine the sore, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease on the head or chin."
Leviticus,13,31,"But if, when the priest examines the sore, it does not seem to be more than skin deep and there is no black hair in it, then the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days."
Leviticus,13,32,"On the seventh day the priest is to examine the sore, and if it has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it and it does not appear to be more than skin deep,"
Leviticus,13,33,"then the man or woman must shave themselves, except for the affected area, and the priest is to keep them isolated another seven days."
Leviticus,13,34,"On the seventh day the priest is to examine the sore, and if it has not spread in the skin and appears to be no more than skin deep, the priest shall pronounce them clean. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,"But if the sore does spread in the skin after they are pronounced clean,"
Leviticus,13,36,"the priest is to examine them, and if he finds that the sore has spread in the skin, he does not need to look for yellow hair; they are unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"If, however, the sore is unchanged so far as the priest can see, and if black hair has grown in it, the affected person is healed. They are clean, and the priest shall pronounce them clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"“When a man or woman has white spots on the skin,"
Leviticus,13,39,"the priest is to examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; they are clean."
Leviticus,13,40,“A man who has lost his hair and is bald is clean.
Leviticus,13,41,"If he has lost his hair from the front of his scalp and has a bald forehead, he is clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"But if he has a reddish-white sore on his bald head or forehead, it is a defiling disease breaking out on his head or forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"The priest is to examine him, and if the swollen sore on his head or forehead is reddish-white like a defiling skin disease,"
Leviticus,13,44,the man is diseased and is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean because of the sore on his head.
Leviticus,13,45,"“Anyone with such a defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let their hair be unkempt, cover the lower part of their face and cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’"
Leviticus,13,46,As long as they have the disease they remain unclean. They must live alone; they must live outside the camp.
Leviticus,13,47,"“As for any fabric that is spoiled with a defiling mold—any woolen or linen clothing,"
Leviticus,13,48,"any woven or knitted material of linen or wool, any leather or anything made of leather—"
Leviticus,13,49,"if the affected area in the fabric, the leather, the woven or knitted material, or any leather article, is greenish or reddish, it is a defiling mold and must be shown to the priest."
Leviticus,13,50,The priest is to examine the affected area and isolate the article for seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,"On the seventh day he is to examine it, and if the mold has spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather, whatever its use, it is a persistent defiling mold; the article is unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"He must burn the fabric, the woven or knitted material of wool or linen, or any leather article that has been spoiled; because the defiling mold is persistent, the article must be burned."
Leviticus,13,53,"“But if, when the priest examines it, the mold has not spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather article,"
Leviticus,13,54,he shall order that the spoiled article be washed. Then he is to isolate it for another seven days.
Leviticus,13,55,"After the article has been washed, the priest is to examine it again, and if the mold has not changed its appearance, even though it has not spread, it is unclean. Burn it, no matter which side of the fabric has been spoiled."
Leviticus,13,56,"If, when the priest examines it, the mold has faded after the article has been washed, he is to tear the spoiled part out of the fabric, the leather, or the woven or knitted material."
Leviticus,13,57,"But if it reappears in the fabric, in the woven or knitted material, or in the leather article, it is a spreading mold; whatever has the mold must be burned."
Leviticus,13,58,"Any fabric, woven or knitted material, or any leather article that has been washed and is rid of the mold, must be washed again. Then it will be clean.”"
Leviticus,13,59,"These are the regulations concerning defiling molds in woolen or linen clothing, woven or knitted material, or any leather article, for pronouncing them clean or unclean."
Leviticus,14,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,14,2,"“These are the regulations for any diseased person at the time of their ceremonial cleansing, when they are brought to the priest:"
Leviticus,14,3,"The priest is to go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease,"
Leviticus,14,4,"the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the person to be cleansed."
Leviticus,14,5,Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot.
Leviticus,14,6,"He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water."
Leviticus,14,7,"Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease, and then pronounce them clean. After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields."
Leviticus,14,8,"“The person to be cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair and bathe with water; then they will be ceremonially clean. After this they may come into the camp, but they must stay outside their tent for seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"On the seventh day they must shave off all their hair; they must shave their head, their beard, their eyebrows and the rest of their hair. They must wash their clothes and bathe themselves with water, and they will be clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"“On the eighth day they must bring two male lambs and one ewe lamb a year old, each without defect, along with three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil."
Leviticus,14,11,The priest who pronounces them clean shall present both the one to be cleansed and their offerings before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,14,12,"“Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil; he shall wave them before the LORD as a wave offering."
Leviticus,14,13,"He is to slaughter the lamb in the sanctuary area where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy."
Leviticus,14,14,"The priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot."
Leviticus,14,15,"The priest shall then take some of the log of oil, pour it in the palm of his own left hand,"
Leviticus,14,16,"dip his right forefinger into the oil in his palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of it before the LORD seven times."
Leviticus,14,17,"The priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering."
Leviticus,14,18,The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed and make atonement for them before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,19,"“Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from their uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering"
Leviticus,14,20,"and offer it on the altar, together with the grain offering, and make atonement for them, and they will be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"“If, however, they are poor and cannot afford these, they must take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for them, together with a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a log of oil,"
Leviticus,14,22,"and two doves or two young pigeons, such as they can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"“On the eighth day they must bring them for their cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,24,"The priest is to take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering."
Leviticus,14,25,"He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot."
Leviticus,14,26,"The priest is to pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,"
Leviticus,14,27,and with his right forefinger sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,28,"Some of the oil in his palm he is to put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering—on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot."
Leviticus,14,29,"The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for them before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,30,"Then he shall sacrifice the doves or the young pigeons, such as the person can afford,"
Leviticus,14,31,"one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed.”"
Leviticus,14,32,These are the regulations for anyone who has a defiling skin disease and who cannot afford the regular offerings for their cleansing.
Leviticus,14,33,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Leviticus,14,34,"“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mold in a house in that land,"
Leviticus,14,35,"the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, ‘I have seen something that looks like a defiling mold in my house.’"
Leviticus,14,36,"The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mold, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house."
Leviticus,14,37,"He is to examine the mold on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall,"
Leviticus,14,38,the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days.
Leviticus,14,39,"On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mold has spread on the walls,"
Leviticus,14,40,he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.
Leviticus,14,41,He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town.
Leviticus,14,42,Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.
Leviticus,14,43,"“If the defiling mold reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered,"
Leviticus,14,44,"the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mold has spread in the house, it is a persistent defiling mold; the house is unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"It must be torn down—its stones, timbers and all the plaster—and taken out of the town to an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,“Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening.
Leviticus,14,47,Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.
Leviticus,14,48,"“But if the priest comes to examine it and the mold has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the defiling mold is gone."
Leviticus,14,49,"To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop."
Leviticus,14,50,He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
Leviticus,14,51,"Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"He shall purify the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn."
Leviticus,14,53,"Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.”"
Leviticus,14,54,"These are the regulations for any defiling skin disease, for a sore,"
Leviticus,14,55,"for defiling molds in fabric or in a house,"
Leviticus,14,56,"and for a swelling, a rash or a shiny spot,"
Leviticus,14,57,to determine when something is clean or unclean. These are the regulations for defiling skin diseases and defiling molds.
Leviticus,15,1,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When any man has an unusual bodily discharge, such a discharge is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"Whether it continues flowing from his body or is blocked, it will make him unclean. This is how his discharge will bring about uncleanness:"
Leviticus,15,4,"“‘Any bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean, and anything he sits on will be unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"Anyone who touches his bed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening."

Leviticus,15,21,"Anyone who touches her bed will be unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,15,22,"Anyone who touches anything she sits on will be unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,15,23,"Whether it is the bed or anything she was sitting on, when anyone touches it, they will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"“‘If a man has sexual relations with her and her monthly flow touches him, he will be unclean for seven days; any bed he lies on will be unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"“‘When a woman has a discharge of blood for many days at a time other than her monthly period or has a discharge that continues beyond her period, she will be unclean as long as she has the discharge, just as in the days of her period."
Leviticus,15,26,"Any bed she lies on while her discharge continues will be unclean, as is her bed during her monthly period, and anything she sits on will be unclean, as during her period."
Leviticus,15,27,"Anyone who touches them will be unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"“‘When she is cleansed from her discharge, she must count off seven days, and after that she will be ceremonially clean."
Leviticus,15,29,On the eighth day she must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,15,30,The priest is to sacrifice one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way he will make atonement for her before the LORD for the uncleanness of her discharge.
Leviticus,15,31,"“‘You must keep the Israelites separate from things that make them unclean, so they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my dwelling place, which is among them.’”"
Leviticus,15,32,"These are the regulations for a man with a discharge, for anyone made unclean by an emission of semen,"
Leviticus,15,33,"for a woman in her monthly period, for a man or a woman with a discharge, and for a man who has sexual relations with a woman who is ceremonially unclean."
Leviticus,16,1,The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they approached the LORD.
Leviticus,16,2,"The LORD said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron that he is not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark, or else he will die. For I will appear in the cloud over the atonement cover."
Leviticus,16,3,“This is how Aaron is to enter the Most Holy Place: He must first bring a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,"He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on."
Leviticus,16,5,From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,“Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.
Leviticus,16,7,Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,He is to cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat.
Leviticus,16,9,Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the LORD and sacrifice it for a sin offering.
Leviticus,16,10,But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat.
Leviticus,16,11,"“Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering."
Leviticus,16,12,He is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain.
Leviticus,16,13,"He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the tablets of the covenant law, so that he will not die."
Leviticus,16,14,He is to take some of the bull’s blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
Leviticus,16,15,“He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull’s blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.
Leviticus,16,16,"In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He is to do the same for the tent of meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness."
Leviticus,16,17,"No one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household and the whole community of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,“Then he shall come out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
Leviticus,16,19,He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
Leviticus,16,20,"“When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat."
Leviticus,16,21,He is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat’s head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task.
Leviticus,16,22,The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place; and the man shall release it in the wilderness.
Leviticus,16,23,"“Then Aaron is to go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is to leave them there."
Leviticus,16,24,"He shall bathe himself with water in the sanctuary area and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people."
Leviticus,16,25,He shall also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,“The man who releases the goat as a scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
Leviticus,16,27,"The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh and intestines are to be burned up."
Leviticus,16,28,The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
Leviticus,16,29,“This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month you must deny yourselves and not do any work—whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you—
Leviticus,16,30,"because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the LORD, you will be clean from all your sins."
Leviticus,16,31,"It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance."
Leviticus,16,32,The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments
Leviticus,16,33,"and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the tent of meeting and the altar, and for the priests and all the members of the community."
Leviticus,16,34,"“This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites.” And it was done, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,17,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,17,2,“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘This is what the LORD has commanded:
Leviticus,17,3,"Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox, a lamb or a goat in the camp or outside of it"
Leviticus,17,4,instead of bringing it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD in front of the tabernacle of the LORD—that person shall be considered guilty of bloodshed; they have shed blood and must be cut off from their people.
Leviticus,17,5,"This is so the Israelites will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the LORD, at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings."
Leviticus,17,6,The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
Leviticus,17,7,They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.’
Leviticus,17,8,“Say to them: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
Leviticus,17,9,and does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD must be cut off from the people of Israel.
Leviticus,17,10,"“‘I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood, and I will cut them off from the people."
Leviticus,17,11,"For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life."
Leviticus,17,12,"Therefore I say to the Israelites, “None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner residing among you eat blood.”"
Leviticus,17,13,"“‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with earth,"
Leviticus,17,14,"because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites, “You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off.”"
Leviticus,17,15,"“‘Anyone, whether native-born or foreigner, who eats anything found dead or torn by wild animals must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be ceremonially unclean till evening; then they will be clean."
Leviticus,17,16,"But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe themselves, they will be held responsible.’”"
Leviticus,18,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,18,2,“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,18,3,"You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices."

Leviticus,18,24,"“‘Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled."
Leviticus,18,25,"Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants."
Leviticus,18,26,"But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the foreigners residing among you must not do any of these detestable things,"
Leviticus,18,27,"for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled."

Leviticus,21,3,or an unmarried sister who is dependent on him since she has no husband—for her he may make himself unclean.
Leviticus,21,4,"He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by marriage, and so defile himself."
Leviticus,21,5,“‘Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies.
Leviticus,21,6,"They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the food offerings to the LORD, the food of their God, they are to be holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"“‘They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God."
Leviticus,21,8,"Regard them as holy, because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy, because I the LORD am holy—I who make you holy."
Leviticus,21,9,"“‘If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire."
Leviticus,21,10,"“‘The high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes."
Leviticus,21,11,"He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother,"

Leviticus,21,15,"so that he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the LORD, who makes him holy.’”"
Leviticus,21,16,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,21,17,“Say to Aaron: ‘For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God.
Leviticus,21,18,"No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed;"
Leviticus,21,19,"no man with a crippled foot or hand,"
Leviticus,21,20,"or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has any eye defect, or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles."
Leviticus,21,21,No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the food offerings to the LORD. He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God.
Leviticus,21,22,"He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food;"
Leviticus,21,23,"yet because of his defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar, and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the LORD, who makes them holy.’”"
Leviticus,21,24,So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
Leviticus,22,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,22,2,"“Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the Israelites consecrate to me, so they will not profane my holy name. I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,3,"“Say to them: ‘For the generations to come, if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person must be cut off from my presence. I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,4,"“‘If a descendant of Aaron has a defiling skin disease or a bodily discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen,"
Leviticus,22,5,"or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean, or any person who makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be."
Leviticus,22,6,The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.
Leviticus,22,7,"When the sun goes down, he will be clean, and after that he may eat the sacred offerings, for they are his food."
Leviticus,22,8,"He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, and so become unclean through it. I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,9,"“‘The priests are to perform my service in such a way that they do not become guilty and die for treating it with contempt. I am the LORD, who makes them holy."
Leviticus,22,10,"“‘No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it."
Leviticus,22,11,"But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if slaves are born in his household, they may eat his food."
Leviticus,22,12,"If a priest’s daughter marries anyone other than a priest, she may not eat any of the sacred contributions."
Leviticus,22,13,"But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has no children, and she returns to live in her father’s household as in her youth, she may eat her father’s food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat it."
Leviticus,22,14,“‘Anyone who eats a sacred offering by mistake must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it.
Leviticus,22,15,The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to the LORD
Leviticus,22,16,"by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt requiring payment. I am the LORD, who makes them holy.’”"
Leviticus,22,17,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,22,18,"“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘If any of you—whether an Israelite or a foreigner residing in Israel—presents a gift for a burnt offering to the LORD, either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering,"
Leviticus,22,19,"you must present a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf."
Leviticus,22,20,"Do not bring anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf."
Leviticus,22,21,"When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship offering to the LORD to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without defect or blemish to be acceptable."
Leviticus,22,22,"Do not offer to the LORD the blind, the injured or the maimed, or anything with warts or festering or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as a food offering presented to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,23,"You may, however, present as a freewill offering an ox or a sheep that is deformed or stunted, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow."
Leviticus,22,24,"You must not offer to the LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land,"
Leviticus,22,25,"and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and have defects.’”"
Leviticus,22,26,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,22,27,"“When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born, it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,28,Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.
Leviticus,22,29,"“When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf."
Leviticus,22,30,It must be eaten that same day; leave none of it till morning. I am the LORD.
Leviticus,22,31,“Keep my commands and follow them. I am the LORD.
Leviticus,22,32,"Do not profane my holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the LORD, who made you holy"
Leviticus,22,33,and who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD.”
Leviticus,23,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘These are my appointed festivals, the appointed festivals of the LORD, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies."
Leviticus,23,3,"The Sabbath “‘There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,4,"The Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread “‘These are the LORD’s appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times:"
Leviticus,23,5,The LORD’s Passover begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Leviticus,23,6,On the fifteenth day of that month the LORD’s Festival of Unleavened Bread begins; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast.
Leviticus,23,7,On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
Leviticus,23,8,For seven days present a food offering to the LORD. And on the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.’”
Leviticus,23,9,"Offering the Firstfruits The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you and you reap its harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain you harvest."
Leviticus,23,11,He is to wave the sheaf before the LORD so it will be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
Leviticus,23,12,"On the day you wave the sheaf, you must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the LORD a lamb a year old without defect,"
Leviticus,23,13,"together with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil—a food offering presented to the LORD, a pleasing aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine."
Leviticus,23,14,"You must not eat any bread, or roasted or new grain, until the very day you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live."
Leviticus,23,15,"The Festival of Weeks “‘From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks."
Leviticus,23,16,"Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,17,"From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,18,"Present with this bread seven male lambs, each a year old and without defect, one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the LORD, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,19,"Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs, each a year old, for a fellowship offering."
Leviticus,23,20,"The priest is to wave the two lambs before the LORD as a wave offering, together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the LORD for the priest."
Leviticus,23,21,"On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live."
Leviticus,23,22,"“‘When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the foreigner residing among you. I am the LORD your God.’”"
Leviticus,23,23,"The Festival of Trumpets The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,24,"“Say to the Israelites: ‘On the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of sabbath rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts."
Leviticus,23,25,"Do no regular work, but present a food offering to the LORD.’”"
Leviticus,23,26,"The Day of Atonement The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,27,"“The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. Hold a sacred assembly and deny yourselves, and present a food offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,28,"Do not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,29,Those who do not deny themselves on that day must be cut off from their people.
Leviticus,23,30,I will destroy from among their people anyone who does any work on that day.
Leviticus,23,31,"You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live."
Leviticus,23,32,"It is a day of sabbath rest for you, and you must deny yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to observe your sabbath.”"
Leviticus,23,33,"The Festival of Tabernacles The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,23,34,"“Say to the Israelites: ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the LORD’s Festival of Tabernacles begins, and it lasts for seven days."
Leviticus,23,35,The first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work.
Leviticus,23,36,"For seven days present food offerings to the LORD, and on the eighth day hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the LORD. It is the closing special assembly; do no regular work."
Leviticus,23,37,"(“‘These are the LORD’s appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for bringing food offerings to the LORD—the burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day."
Leviticus,23,38,These offerings are in addition to those for the LORD’s Sabbaths and in addition to your gifts and whatever you have vowed and all the freewill offerings you give to the LORD.)
Leviticus,23,39,"“‘So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the LORD for seven days; the first day is a day of sabbath rest, and the eighth day also is a day of sabbath rest."
Leviticus,23,40,"On the first day you are to take branches from luxuriant trees—from palms, willows and other leafy trees—and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,Celebrate this as a festival to the LORD for seven days each year. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,Live in temporary shelters for seven days: All native-born Israelites are to live in such shelters
Leviticus,23,43,so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’”
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the LORD.
Leviticus,24,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,24,2,“Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.
Leviticus,24,3,"Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come."
Leviticus,24,4,The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD must be tended continually.
Leviticus,24,5,"“Take the finest flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf."
Leviticus,24,6,"Arrange them in two stacks, six in each stack, on the table of pure gold before the LORD."
Leviticus,24,7,By each stack put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be a food offering presented to the LORD.
Leviticus,24,8,"This bread is to be set out before the LORD regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant."
Leviticus,24,9,"It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the LORD.”"
Leviticus,24,10,"Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite."
Leviticus,24,11,"The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)"
Leviticus,24,12,They put him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.
Leviticus,24,13,Then the LORD said to Moses:
Leviticus,24,14,"“Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who curses their God will be held responsible;
Leviticus,24,16,"anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD is to be put to death. The entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,“‘Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,Anyone who takes the life of someone’s animal must make restitution—life for life.
Leviticus,24,19,Anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner:
Leviticus,24,20,"fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury."
Leviticus,24,21,"Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the LORD your God.’”
Leviticus,24,23,"Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"The LORD said to Moses at Mount Sinai,"
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the LORD."
Leviticus,25,3,"For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops."
Leviticus,25,4,"But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the LORD. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards."
Leviticus,25,5,Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.
Leviticus,25,6,"Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you,"
Leviticus,25,7,as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.
Leviticus,25,8,“‘Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years.
Leviticus,25,9,Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land.
Leviticus,25,10,Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan.
Leviticus,25,11,The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
Leviticus,25,13,“‘In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.
Leviticus,25,14,"“‘If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other."
Leviticus,25,15,You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.
Leviticus,25,16,"When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops."
Leviticus,25,17,"Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"“‘Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land."
Leviticus,25,19,"Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety."
Leviticus,25,20,"You may ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?”"
Leviticus,25,21,I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
Leviticus,25,22,"While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in."
Leviticus,25,23,"“‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers."
Leviticus,25,24,"Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land."
Leviticus,25,25,"“‘If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves,"
Leviticus,25,27,they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property.
Leviticus,25,28,"But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property."
Leviticus,25,29,“‘Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it.
Leviticus,25,30,"If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer’s descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"“‘The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess."
Leviticus,25,33,"So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites."
Leviticus,25,34,But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
Leviticus,25,35,"“‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you."
Leviticus,25,37,You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.
Leviticus,25,38,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"“‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves."
Leviticus,25,40,They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,41,"Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors."
Leviticus,25,42,"Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves."
Leviticus,25,43,"Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God."
Leviticus,25,44,“‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves.
Leviticus,25,45,"You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property."
Leviticus,25,46,"You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly."
Leviticus,25,47,"“‘If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner’s clan,"
Leviticus,25,48,they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them:
Leviticus,25,49,"An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves."
Leviticus,25,50,They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years.
Leviticus,25,51,"If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them."
Leviticus,25,52,"If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly."
Leviticus,25,53,They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.
Leviticus,25,54,"“‘Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,"
Leviticus,25,55,"for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,26,1,"“‘Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,26,2,“‘Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am the LORD.
Leviticus,26,3,"“‘If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands,"
Leviticus,26,4,"I will send you rain in its season, and the ground will yield its crops and the trees their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting, and you will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land."
Leviticus,26,6,"“‘I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down and no one will make you afraid. I will remove wild beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your country."
Leviticus,26,7,"You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you."
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you."
Leviticus,26,9,"“‘I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers, and I will keep my covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,You will still be eating last year’s harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new.
Leviticus,26,11,"I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high."
Leviticus,26,14,"“‘But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands,"
Leviticus,26,15,"and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant,"
Leviticus,26,16,"then I will do this to you: I will bring on you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it."
Leviticus,26,17,"I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you."
Leviticus,26,18,"“‘If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over."
Leviticus,26,19,I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze.
Leviticus,26,20,"Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of your land yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"“‘If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted."
Leviticus,26,23,"“‘If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me,"
Leviticus,26,24,I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over.
Leviticus,26,25,"And I will bring the sword on you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be given into enemy hands."
Leviticus,26,26,"When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat, but you will not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"“‘If in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward me,"
Leviticus,26,28,"then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times over."
Leviticus,26,29,You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.
Leviticus,26,30,"I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings."
Leviticus,26,32,"I myself will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who live there will be appalled."
Leviticus,26,33,"I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins."
Leviticus,26,34,Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus,26,35,"All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it."
Leviticus,26,36,"“‘As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them."
Leviticus,26,37,"They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you.
Leviticus,26,39,Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their ancestors’ sins they will waste away.
Leviticus,26,40,"“‘But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors—their unfaithfulness and their hostility toward me,"
Leviticus,26,41,"which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies—then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin,"
Leviticus,26,42,"I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees.
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the LORD their God."
Leviticus,26,45,But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the LORD.’”
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established at Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses."
Leviticus,27,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the LORD by giving the equivalent value,"
Leviticus,27,3,"set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel;"
Leviticus,27,4,"for a female, set her value at thirty shekels;"
Leviticus,27,5,"for a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels;"
Leviticus,27,6,"for a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver;"
Leviticus,27,7,"for a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels and of a female at ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, the person being dedicated is to be presented to the priest, who will set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford."
Leviticus,27,9,"“‘If what they vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the LORD, such an animal given to the LORD becomes holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"They must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if they should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"If what they vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD—the animal must be presented to the priest,"
Leviticus,27,12,"who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be."
Leviticus,27,13,"If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, a fifth must be added to its value."
Leviticus,27,14,"“‘If anyone dedicates their house as something holy to the LORD, the priest will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, so it will remain."
Leviticus,27,15,"If the one who dedicates their house wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the house will again become theirs."
Leviticus,27,16,"“‘If anyone dedicates to the LORD part of their family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed."
Leviticus,27,17,"If they dedicate a field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if they dedicate a field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced."
Leviticus,27,19,"If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become theirs."
Leviticus,27,20,"If, however, they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed."
Leviticus,27,21,"When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it will become priestly property."
Leviticus,27,22,"“‘If anyone dedicates to the LORD a field they have bought, which is not part of their family land,"
Leviticus,27,23,"the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the owner must pay its value on that day as something holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought, the one whose land it was."
Leviticus,27,25,"Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel."
Leviticus,27,26,"“‘No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the LORD; whether an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD’s."
Leviticus,27,27,"If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be bought back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If it is not redeemed, it is to be sold at its set value."
Leviticus,27,28,“‘But nothing that a person owns and devotes to the LORD—whether a human being or an animal or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD.
Leviticus,27,29,“‘No person devoted to destruction may be ransomed; they are to be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,"“‘A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,31,Whoever would redeem any of their tithe must add a fifth of the value to it.
Leviticus,27,32,Every tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the LORD.
Leviticus,27,33,"No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If anyone does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.’”"
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commands the LORD gave Moses at Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
Numbers,1,1,The LORD spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said:
Numbers,1,2,"“Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one."
Numbers,1,3,You and Aaron are to count according to their divisions all the men in Israel who are twenty years old or more and able to serve in the army.
Numbers,1,4,"One man from each tribe, each of them the head of his family, is to help you."
Numbers,1,5,"These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;"
Numbers,1,6,"from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;"
Numbers,1,7,"from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;"
Numbers,1,8,"from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;"
Numbers,1,9,"from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;"
Numbers,1,10,"from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;"
Numbers,1,11,"from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;"
Numbers,1,12,"from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;"
Numbers,1,13,"from Asher, Pagiel son of Okran;"
Numbers,1,14,"from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;"
Numbers,1,15,"from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.”"
Numbers,1,16,"These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel."
Numbers,1,17,"Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been specified,"
Numbers,1,18,"and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people registered their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one,"
Numbers,1,19,as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai:
Numbers,1,20,"From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,21,"The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500."
Numbers,1,22,"From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,23,"The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300."
Numbers,1,24,"From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,25,"The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650."
Numbers,1,26,"From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,27,"The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600."
Numbers,1,28,"From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,29,"The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400."
Numbers,1,30,"From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,31,"The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400."
Numbers,1,32,"From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,33,"The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500."
Numbers,1,34,"From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."

Numbers,1,37,"The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400."

Numbers,1,41,"The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500."
Numbers,1,42,"From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families."
Numbers,1,43,"The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400."
Numbers,1,44,"These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family."
Numbers,1,45,All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel’s army were counted according to their families.
Numbers,1,46,"The total number was 603,550."
Numbers,1,47,"The ancestral tribe of the Levites, however, was not counted along with the others."
Numbers,1,48,The LORD had said to Moses:
Numbers,1,49,“You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.
Numbers,1,50,"Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the covenant law—over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it."
Numbers,1,51,"Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who approaches it is to be put to death."
Numbers,1,52,"The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each of them in their own camp under their standard."
Numbers,1,53,"The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the covenant law so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the covenant law.”"
Numbers,1,54,The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,2,1,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,2,2,"“The Israelites are to camp around the tent of meeting some distance from it, each of them under their standard and holding the banners of their family.”"
Numbers,2,3,"On the east, toward the sunrise, the divisions of the camp of Judah are to encamp under their standard. The leader of the people of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab."
Numbers,2,4,"His division numbers 74,600."
Numbers,2,5,The tribe of Issachar will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Issachar is Nethanel son of Zuar.
Numbers,2,6,"His division numbers 54,400."
Numbers,2,7,The tribe of Zebulun will be next. The leader of the people of Zebulun is Eliab son of Helon.
Numbers,2,8,"His division numbers 57,400."
Numbers,2,9,"All the men assigned to the camp of Judah, according to their divisions, number 186,400. They will set out first."
Numbers,2,10,On the south will be the divisions of the camp of Reuben under their standard. The leader of the people of Reuben is Elizur son of Shedeur.
Numbers,2,11,"His division numbers 46,500."
Numbers,2,12,The tribe of Simeon will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,2,13,"His division numbers 59,300."
Numbers,2,14,The tribe of Gad will be next. The leader of the people of Gad is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
Numbers,2,15,"His division numbers 45,650."
Numbers,2,16,"All the men assigned to the camp of Reuben, according to their divisions, number 151,450. They will set out second."
Numbers,2,17,"Then the tent of meeting and the camp of the Levites will set out in the middle of the camps. They will set out in the same order as they encamp, each in their own place under their standard."
Numbers,2,18,On the west will be the divisions of the camp of Ephraim under their standard. The leader of the people of Ephraim is Elishama son of Ammihud.
Numbers,2,19,"His division numbers 40,500."
Numbers,2,20,The tribe of Manasseh will be next to them. The leader of the people of Manasseh is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,2,21,"His division numbers 32,200."
Numbers,2,22,The tribe of Benjamin will be next. The leader of the people of Benjamin is Abidan son of Gideoni.
Numbers,2,23,"His division numbers 35,400."
Numbers,2,24,"All the men assigned to the camp of Ephraim, according to their divisions, number 108,100. They will set out third."
Numbers,2,25,On the north will be the divisions of the camp of Dan under their standard. The leader of the people of Dan is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.

Numbers,2,32,"These are the Israelites, counted according to their families. All the men in the camps, by their divisions, number 603,550."
Numbers,2,33,"The Levites, however, were not counted along with the other Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,2,34,"So the Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; that is the way they encamped under their standards, and that is the way they set out, each of them with their clan and family."
Numbers,3,1,This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"Those were the names of Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests."
Numbers,3,4,"Nadab and Abihu, however, died before the LORD when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron."
Numbers,3,5,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,3,6,“Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
Numbers,3,7,They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,8,"They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,9,Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.
Numbers,3,10,Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary is to be put to death.”
Numbers,3,11,"The LORD also said to Moses,"
Numbers,3,12,"“I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,"
Numbers,3,13,"for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am the LORD.”"
Numbers,3,14,"The LORD said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,"
Numbers,3,15,“Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more.”
Numbers,3,16,"So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD."
Numbers,3,17,"These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari."
Numbers,3,18,These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.
Numbers,3,19,"The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel."
Numbers,3,20,"The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families."
Numbers,3,21,To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.
Numbers,3,22,"The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500."
Numbers,3,23,"The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,24,The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
Numbers,3,25,"At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,3,26,"the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything related to their use."
Numbers,3,27,"To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans."
Numbers,3,28,"The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,29,The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,30,The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
Numbers,3,31,"They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use."
Numbers,3,32,"The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,33,To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.
Numbers,3,34,"The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200."
Numbers,3,35,The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,36,"The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,"
Numbers,3,37,"as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes."
Numbers,3,38,"Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"The total number of Levites counted at the LORD’s command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000."
Numbers,3,40,"The LORD said to Moses, “Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names."
Numbers,3,41,"Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the LORD.”"
Numbers,3,42,"So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him."
Numbers,3,43,"The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273."
Numbers,3,44,"The LORD also said to Moses,"
Numbers,3,45,"“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am the LORD."
Numbers,3,46,"To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,"
Numbers,3,47,"collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs."
Numbers,3,48,Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons.”
Numbers,3,49,So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.
Numbers,3,50,"From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel."
Numbers,3,51,"Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD."
Numbers,4,1,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,4,2,“Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.
Numbers,4,3,Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,4,4,“This is the work of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting: the care of the most holy things.
Numbers,4,5,"When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and put it over the ark of the covenant law."
Numbers,4,6,"Then they are to cover the curtain with a durable leather, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place."
Numbers,4,7,"“Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it."
Numbers,4,8,"They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place."
Numbers,4,9,"“They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the olive oil used to supply it."
Numbers,4,10,Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of the durable leather and put it on a carrying frame.
Numbers,4,11,“Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.
Numbers,4,12,"“They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with the durable leather and put them on a carrying frame."
Numbers,4,13,“They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
Numbers,4,14,"Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of the durable leather and put the poles in place."
Numbers,4,15,"“After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,16,"“Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles.”"
Numbers,4,17,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,4,18,“See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not destroyed from among the Levites.
Numbers,4,19,"So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry."
Numbers,4,20,"But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die.”"
Numbers,4,21,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,4,22,“Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans.
Numbers,4,23,Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,4,24,“This is the service of the Gershonite clans in their carrying and their other work:
Numbers,4,25,"They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, that is, the tent of meeting, its covering and its outer covering of durable leather, the curtains for the entrance to the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,4,26,"the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes and all the equipment used in the service of the tent. The Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things."
Numbers,4,27,"All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as their responsibility all they are to carry."
Numbers,4,28,"This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest."
Numbers,4,29,“Count the Merarites by their clans and families.
Numbers,4,30,Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,4,31,"As part of all their service at the tent, they are to carry the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts and bases,"
Numbers,4,32,"as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, ropes, all their equipment and everything related to their use. Assign to each man the specific things he is to carry."
Numbers,4,33,"This is the service of the Merarite clans as they work at the tent of meeting under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.”"
Numbers,4,34,"Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families."
Numbers,4,35,"All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,4,36,"counted by clans, were 2,750."
Numbers,4,37,This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD’s command through Moses.
Numbers,4,38,The Gershonites were counted by their clans and families.
Numbers,4,39,"All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,4,40,"counted by their clans and families, were 2,630."
Numbers,4,41,This was the total of those in the Gershonite clans who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD’s command.
Numbers,4,42,The Merarites were counted by their clans and families.
Numbers,4,43,"All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,4,44,"counted by their clans, were 3,200."
Numbers,4,45,This was the total of those in the Merarite clans. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD’s command through Moses.
Numbers,4,46,"So Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted all the Levites by their clans and families."
Numbers,4,47,All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to do the work of serving and carrying the tent of meeting
Numbers,4,48,"numbered 8,580."
Numbers,4,49,"At the LORD’s command through Moses, each was assigned his work and told what to carry. Thus they were counted, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,5,2,"“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a defiling skin disease or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body."
Numbers,5,3,"Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.”"
Numbers,5,4,The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
Numbers,5,5,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,5,6,“Say to the Israelites: ‘Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the LORD is guilty
Numbers,5,7,"and must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution for the wrong they have done, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the person they have wronged."
Numbers,5,8,"But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for the wrongdoer."
Numbers,5,9,All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
Numbers,5,10,"Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.’”"
Numbers,5,11,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,5,12,“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
Numbers,5,13,"so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act),"
Numbers,5,14,and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure—
Numbers,5,15,"then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing."
Numbers,5,16,“‘The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the LORD.
Numbers,5,17,Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.
Numbers,5,18,"After the priest has had the woman stand before the LORD, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,19,"Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you."
Numbers,5,20,But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”—
Numbers,5,21,here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—“may the LORD cause you to become a curse among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell.
Numbers,5,22,"May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.” “‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be it.”"
Numbers,5,23,“‘The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.
Numbers,5,24,"He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her."
Numbers,5,25,"The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD and bring it to the altar."
Numbers,5,26,"The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water."
Numbers,5,27,"If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse."
Numbers,5,28,"If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children."
Numbers,5,29,"“‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband,"
Numbers,5,30,or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the LORD and is to apply this entire law to her.
Numbers,5,31,"The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.’”"
Numbers,6,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,6,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man or woman wants to make a special vow, a vow of dedication to the LORD as a Nazirite,"
Numbers,6,3,they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
Numbers,6,4,"As long as they remain under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins."
Numbers,6,5,"“‘During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to the LORD is over; they must let their hair grow long."
Numbers,6,6,"“‘Throughout the period of their dedication to the LORD, the Nazirite must not go near a dead body."
Numbers,6,7,"Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister dies, they must not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head."
Numbers,6,8,"Throughout the period of their dedication, they are consecrated to the LORD."
Numbers,6,9,"“‘If someone dies suddenly in the Nazirite’s presence, thus defiling the hair that symbolizes their dedication, they must shave their head on the seventh day—the day of their cleansing."
Numbers,6,10,Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,6,11,The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to consecrate their head again.
Numbers,6,12,"They must rededicate themselves to the LORD for the same period of dedication and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, because they became defiled during their period of dedication."
Numbers,6,13,“‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,6,14,"There they are to present their offerings to the LORD: a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering,"
Numbers,6,15,"together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made with the finest flour and without yeast—thick loaves with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves brushed with olive oil."
Numbers,6,16,“‘The priest is to present all these before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.
Numbers,6,17,"He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the LORD, together with its grain offering and drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,"“‘Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering."
Numbers,6,19,"“‘After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast."
Numbers,6,20,"The priest shall then wave these before the LORD as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine."
Numbers,6,21,"“‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the LORD in accordance with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must fulfill the vows they have made, according to the law of the Nazirite.’”"
Numbers,6,22,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,6,23,"“Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:"
Numbers,6,24,“‘“The LORD bless you and keep you;
Numbers,6,25,the LORD make his face shine on you and be gracious to you;
Numbers,6,26,the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace.”’
Numbers,6,27,"“So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”"
Numbers,7,1,"When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings."
Numbers,7,3,They brought as their gifts before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.
Numbers,7,4,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man’s work requires.”"
Numbers,7,6,So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Numbers,7,7,"He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required,"
Numbers,7,8,"and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest."
Numbers,7,9,"But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible."
Numbers,7,10,"When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar."
Numbers,7,11,"For the LORD had said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to bring his offering for the dedication of the altar.”"
Numbers,7,12,The one who brought his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah.
Numbers,7,13,"His offering was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;"

Numbers,7,89,"When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law. In this way the LORD spoke to him."
Numbers,8,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,2,"“Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you set up the lamps, see that all seven light up the area in front of the lampstand.’”"
Numbers,8,3,"Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,4,This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold—from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the LORD had shown Moses.
Numbers,8,5,The LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,8,6,“Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.
Numbers,8,7,"To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves."
Numbers,8,8,Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
Numbers,8,9,Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.
Numbers,8,10,"You are to bring the Levites before the LORD, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them."
Numbers,8,11,"Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the LORD."
Numbers,8,12,"“Then the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, using one for a sin offering to the LORD and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to the LORD.
Numbers,8,14,"In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine."
Numbers,8,15,"“After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,8,16,"They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every Israelite woman."
Numbers,8,17,"Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself."
Numbers,8,18,And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.
Numbers,8,19,"From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary.”"
Numbers,8,20,"Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,21,The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD and made atonement for them to purify them.
Numbers,8,22,"After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,23,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,8,24,"“This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,8,25,"but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer."
Numbers,8,26,"They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites.”"
Numbers,9,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said,"
Numbers,9,2,“Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time.
Numbers,9,3,"Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations.”"
Numbers,9,4,"So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,"
Numbers,9,5,and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,9,6,But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day
Numbers,9,7,"and said to Moses, “We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the LORD’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?”"
Numbers,9,8,"Moses answered them, “Wait until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you.”"
Numbers,9,9,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,9,10,"“Tell the Israelites: ‘When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate the LORD’s Passover,"
Numbers,9,11,"but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Numbers,9,12,"They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations."
Numbers,9,13,"But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting the LORD’s offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their sin."
Numbers,9,14,“‘A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate the LORD’s Passover in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for both the foreigner and the native-born.’”
Numbers,9,15,"On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire."
Numbers,9,16,"That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire."
Numbers,9,17,"Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped."
Numbers,9,18,"At the LORD’s command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp."
Numbers,9,19,"When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the LORD’s order and did not set out."
Numbers,9,20,"Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the LORD’s command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out."
Numbers,9,21,"Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out."
Numbers,9,23,"At the LORD’s command they encamped, and at the LORD’s command they set out. They obeyed the LORD’s order, in accordance with his command through Moses."
Numbers,10,1,The LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,10,2,"“Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out."
Numbers,10,3,"When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you."
Numbers,10,5,"When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out."
Numbers,10,6,"At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out."
Numbers,10,7,"To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out."
Numbers,10,8,"“The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come."
Numbers,10,9,"When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and rescued from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.”"
Numbers,10,11,"On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law."
Numbers,10,12,Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,"They set out, this first time, at the LORD’s command through Moses."
Numbers,10,14,"The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command."
Numbers,10,15,"Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,"
Numbers,10,16,and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
Numbers,10,17,"Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out."
Numbers,10,18,"The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command."
Numbers,10,19,"Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,"
Numbers,10,20,and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
Numbers,10,21,"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived."
Numbers,10,22,"The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command."
Numbers,10,23,"Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,"
Numbers,10,24,and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
Numbers,10,25,"Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command."
Numbers,10,26,"Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,"
Numbers,10,27,and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
Numbers,10,28,This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
Numbers,10,29,"Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.”"
Numbers,10,31,"But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes."
Numbers,10,32,"If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.”"
Numbers,10,33,So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.
Numbers,10,34,The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
Numbers,10,35,"Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, “Rise up, LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you.”"
Numbers,10,36,"Whenever it came to rest, he said, “Return, LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,"Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the LORD, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down."
Numbers,11,3,"So that place was called Taberah, because fire from the LORD had burned among them."
Numbers,11,4,"The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, “If only we had meat to eat!"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic."
Numbers,11,6,But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!”
Numbers,11,7,The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.
Numbers,11,8,"The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And it tasted like something made with olive oil."
Numbers,11,9,"When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down."
Numbers,11,10,"Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled."
Numbers,11,11,"He asked the LORD, “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors?"
Numbers,11,13,"Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’"
Numbers,11,14,I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
Numbers,11,15,"If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.”"
Numbers,11,16,"The LORD said to Moses: “Bring me seventy of Israel’s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone."
Numbers,11,18,"“Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, “If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!” Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it."
Numbers,11,19,"You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,"
Numbers,11,20,"but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”"
Numbers,11,21,"But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’"
Numbers,11,22,Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?”
Numbers,11,23,"The LORD answered Moses, “Is the LORD’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you.”"
Numbers,11,24,So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent.
Numbers,11,25,"Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again."
Numbers,11,26,"However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”"
Numbers,11,29,"But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD’s people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!”"
Numbers,11,30,Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
Numbers,11,31,"Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits deep all around the camp, as far as a day’s walk in any direction."
Numbers,11,32,All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.
Numbers,11,33,"But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague."
Numbers,11,34,"Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food."
Numbers,11,35,From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
Numbers,12,1,"Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite."
Numbers,12,2,“Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t he also spoken through us?” And the LORD heard this.
Numbers,12,3,"(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.” So the three of them went out."
Numbers,12,5,"Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward,"
Numbers,12,6,"he said, “Listen to my words: “When there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, reveal myself to them in visions, I speak to them in dreams."
Numbers,12,7,But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.
Numbers,12,8,"With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”"
Numbers,12,9,"The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them."
Numbers,12,10,"When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin was leprous—it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease,"
Numbers,12,11,"and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed."
Numbers,12,12,Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.”
Numbers,12,13,"So Moses cried out to the LORD, “Please, God, heal her!”"
Numbers,12,14,"The LORD replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back.”"
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back."
Numbers,12,16,"After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,13,2,"“Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.”"
Numbers,13,3,So at the LORD’s command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
Numbers,13,4,"These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur;"
Numbers,13,5,"from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;"
Numbers,13,6,"from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;"
Numbers,13,7,"from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;"
Numbers,13,8,"from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;"
Numbers,13,9,"from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;"
Numbers,13,10,"from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;"
Numbers,13,11,"from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;"
Numbers,13,12,"from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;"
Numbers,13,13,"from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;"
Numbers,13,14,"from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;"
Numbers,13,15,"from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki."
Numbers,13,16,These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)
Numbers,13,17,"When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country."
Numbers,13,18,"See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many."
Numbers,13,19,What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?
Numbers,13,20,How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,"When they reached the Valley of Eshkol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs."
Numbers,13,24,That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
Numbers,13,25,At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.
Numbers,13,26,They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers,13,27,"They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,"But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there."
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.”"
Numbers,13,32,"And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size."
Numbers,13,33,"We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”"
Numbers,14,1,That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.
Numbers,14,2,"All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, “If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,Why is the LORD bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?”
Numbers,14,4,"And they said to each other, “We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.
Numbers,14,6,"Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes"
Numbers,14,7,"and said to the entire Israelite assembly, “The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good."
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us."
Numbers,14,9,"Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them.”"
Numbers,14,10,But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.
Numbers,14,11,"The LORD said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.”"
Numbers,14,13,"Moses said to the LORD, “Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them."
Numbers,14,14,"And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, LORD, are with these people and that you, LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,"
Numbers,14,16,"‘The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’"
Numbers,14,17,"“Now may the Lord’s strength be displayed, just as you have declared:"
Numbers,14,18,"‘The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.’"
Numbers,14,19,"In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.”"
Numbers,14,20,"The LORD replied, “I have forgiven them, as you asked."
Numbers,14,21,"Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,"
Numbers,14,22,not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times—
Numbers,14,23,not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
Numbers,14,24,"But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it."
Numbers,14,25,"Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.”"
Numbers,14,26,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,14,27,“How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
Numbers,14,28,"So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say:"
Numbers,14,29,In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
Numbers,14,30,"Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun."
Numbers,14,31,"As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.’
Numbers,14,35,"I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die.”"
Numbers,14,36,"So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—"
Numbers,14,37,these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD.
Numbers,14,38,"Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived."
Numbers,14,39,"When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly."
Numbers,14,40,"Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the LORD promised. Surely we have sinned!”"
Numbers,14,41,"But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the LORD’s command? This will not succeed!"
Numbers,14,42,"Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,"
Numbers,14,43,"for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword.”"
Numbers,14,44,"Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD’s covenant moved from the camp."
Numbers,14,45,Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
Numbers,15,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,15,2,“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘After you enter the land I am giving you as a home
Numbers,15,3,"and you present to the LORD food offerings from the herd or the flock, as an aroma pleasing to the LORD—whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings—"
Numbers,15,4,then the person who brings an offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of olive oil.
Numbers,15,5,"With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering."
Numbers,15,6,"“‘With a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil,"
Numbers,15,7,and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
Numbers,15,8,"“‘When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the LORD,"
Numbers,15,9,"bring with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil,"
Numbers,15,10,"and also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. This will be a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Numbers,15,11,"Each bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this manner."
Numbers,15,12,"Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare."
Numbers,15,13,“‘Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when they present a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
Numbers,15,14,"For the generations to come, whenever a foreigner or anyone else living among you presents a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, they must do exactly as you do."
Numbers,15,15,The community is to have the same rules for you and for the foreigner residing among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD:
Numbers,15,16,The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigner residing among you.’”
Numbers,15,17,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,15,18,“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land to which I am taking you
Numbers,15,19,"and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to the LORD."
Numbers,15,20,Present a loaf from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor.
Numbers,15,21,Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the LORD from the first of your ground meal.
Numbers,15,22,“‘Now if you as a community unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the LORD gave Moses—
Numbers,15,23,"any of the LORD’s commands to you through him, from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come—"
Numbers,15,24,"and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have presented to the LORD for their wrong a food offering and a sin offering."
Numbers,15,26,"The whole Israelite community and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong."
Numbers,15,27,"“‘But if just one person sins unintentionally, that person must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,28,"The priest is to make atonement before the LORD for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made, that person will be forgiven."
Numbers,15,29,"One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you."
Numbers,15,30,"“‘But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, blasphemes the LORD and must be cut off from the people of Israel."
Numbers,15,31,"Because they have despised the LORD’s word and broken his commands, they must surely be cut off; their guilt remains on them.’”"
Numbers,15,32,"While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,"Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly,"
Numbers,15,34,"and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him."
Numbers,15,35,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.”"
Numbers,15,36,"So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,15,37,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,15,38,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel."
Numbers,15,39,"You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by chasing after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes."
Numbers,15,40,Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God.
Numbers,15,41,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.’”"
Numbers,16,1,"Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—became insolent"
Numbers,16,2,"and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council."
Numbers,16,3,"They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD’s assembly?”"
Numbers,16,4,"When Moses heard this, he fell facedown."
Numbers,16,5,"Then he said to Korah and all his followers: “In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him."
Numbers,16,6,"You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers"
Numbers,16,7,and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!”
Numbers,16,8,"Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites!"
Numbers,16,9,Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD’s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
Numbers,16,10,"He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too."
Numbers,16,11,It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?”
Numbers,16,12,"Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come!"
Numbers,16,13,Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us!
Numbers,16,14,"Moreover, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves? No, we will not come!”"
Numbers,16,15,"Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you and they and Aaron."
Numbers,16,17,Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also.”
Numbers,16,18,"So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Numbers,16,19,"When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly."
Numbers,16,20,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,16,21,“Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.”
Numbers,16,22,"But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, “O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?”"
Numbers,16,23,"Then the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,16,24,"“Say to the assembly, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’”"
Numbers,16,25,"Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him."
Numbers,16,26,"He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”"
Numbers,16,27,"So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents."
Numbers,16,28,"Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:"
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the LORD has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt.”"
Numbers,16,31,"As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart"
Numbers,16,32,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions."
Numbers,16,33,"They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community."
Numbers,16,34,"At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth is going to swallow us too!”"
Numbers,16,35,And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
Numbers,16,36,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,16,37,"“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy—"
Numbers,16,38,"the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.”"
Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,"
Numbers,16,40,"as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers."
Numbers,16,41,"The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. “You have killed the LORD’s people,” they said."
Numbers,16,42,"But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared."
Numbers,16,43,"Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,16,44,"and the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,16,45,“Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” And they fell facedown.
Numbers,16,46,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started.”"
Numbers,16,47,"So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them."
Numbers,16,48,"He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped."
Numbers,16,49,"But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah."
Numbers,16,50,"Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped."
Numbers,17,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,17,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff."
Numbers,17,3,"On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe."
Numbers,17,4,"Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you."
Numbers,17,5,"The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.”"
Numbers,17,6,"So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was among them."
Numbers,17,7,Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the covenant law.
Numbers,17,8,"The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff."
Numbers,17,10,"The LORD said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.”"
Numbers,17,11,Moses did just as the LORD commanded him.
Numbers,17,12,"The Israelites said to Moses, “We will die! We are lost, we are all lost!"
Numbers,17,13,Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to die?”
Numbers,18,1,"The LORD said to Aaron, “You, your sons and your family are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law.
Numbers,18,3,"They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar. Otherwise both they and you will die."
Numbers,18,4,They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting—all the work at the tent—and no one else may come near where you are.
Numbers,18,5,"“You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again."
Numbers,18,6,"I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to do the work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,7,But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death.”
Numbers,18,8,"Then the LORD said to Aaron, “I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share."
Numbers,18,9,"You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons."
Numbers,18,10,Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
Numbers,18,11,“This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
Numbers,18,12,“I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the LORD as the firstfruits of their harvest.
Numbers,18,13,All the land’s firstfruits that they bring to the LORD will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
Numbers,18,14,“Everything in Israel that is devoted to the LORD is yours.
Numbers,18,15,"The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the LORD is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals."
Numbers,18,16,"When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"“But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Numbers,18,18,"Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours."
Numbers,18,19,Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD for both you and your offspring.”
Numbers,18,20,"The LORD said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites."
Numbers,18,21,“I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,18,22,"From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die."
Numbers,18,23,It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites.
Numbers,18,24,"Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the LORD. That is why I said concerning them: ‘They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.’”"
Numbers,18,25,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,18,26,"“Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the LORD’s offering."
Numbers,18,27,Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
Numbers,18,28,In this way you also will present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the LORD’s portion to Aaron the priest.
Numbers,18,29,You must present as the LORD’s portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.’
Numbers,18,30,"“Say to the Levites: ‘When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress."
Numbers,18,31,"You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,32,"By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.’”"
Numbers,19,1,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,19,2,“This is a requirement of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.
Numbers,19,3,Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
Numbers,19,4,Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers,19,5,"While he watches, the heifer is to be burned—its hide, flesh, blood and intestines."
Numbers,19,6,"The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer."
Numbers,19,7,"After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening."
Numbers,19,8,"The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening."
Numbers,19,9,“A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.
Numbers,19,10,"The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them."
Numbers,19,11,“Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse, they defile the LORD’s tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, they are unclean; their uncleanness remains on them."
Numbers,19,14,"“This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days,"
Numbers,19,15,and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.
Numbers,19,16,"“Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"“For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them."
Numbers,19,18,"Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death."
Numbers,19,19,"The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify them. Those who are being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and that evening they will be clean."
Numbers,19,20,"But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"This is a lasting ordinance for them. “The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening."
Numbers,19,22,"Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening.”"
Numbers,20,1,"In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried."
Numbers,20,2,"Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,20,3,"They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the LORD!"
Numbers,20,4,"Why did you bring the LORD’s community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here?"
Numbers,20,5,"Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!”"
Numbers,20,6,"Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them."
Numbers,20,7,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.”"
Numbers,20,9,"So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence, just as he commanded him."
Numbers,20,10,"He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?”"
Numbers,20,11,"Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank."
Numbers,20,12,"But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD and where he was proved holy among them."
Numbers,20,14,"Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us."
Numbers,20,15,"Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors,"
Numbers,20,16,"but when we cried out to the LORD, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. “Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory."
Numbers,20,17,"Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”"
Numbers,20,18,"But Edom answered: “You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.”"
Numbers,20,19,"The Israelites replied: “We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else.”"
Numbers,20,20,Again they answered: “You may not pass through.” Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.
Numbers,20,21,"Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them."
Numbers,20,22,The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,23,"At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,20,24,"“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,26,"Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.”"
Numbers,20,27,Moses did as the LORD commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
Numbers,20,28,"Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain,"
Numbers,20,29,"and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him thirty days."
Numbers,21,1,"When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them."
Numbers,21,2,"Then Israel made this vow to the LORD: “If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities.”"
Numbers,21,3,The LORD listened to Israel’s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.
Numbers,21,4,"They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;"
Numbers,21,5,"they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!”"
Numbers,21,6,Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.
Numbers,21,7,"The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"The LORD said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.”"
Numbers,21,9,"So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived."
Numbers,21,10,The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise."
Numbers,21,12,From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.
Numbers,21,13,"They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: “. . . Zahab in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon"
Numbers,21,15,and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the settlement of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.”
Numbers,21,16,"From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.”"
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Sing about it,"
Numbers,21,18,"about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank— the nobles with scepters and staffs.” Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
Numbers,21,20,and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
Numbers,21,21,Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:
Numbers,21,22,"“Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”"
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel."
Numbers,21,24,"Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified."
Numbers,21,25,"Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements."
Numbers,21,26,"Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon’s city be restored.
Numbers,21,28,"“Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon’s heights."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites."
Numbers,21,30,"“But we have overthrown them; Heshbon’s dominion has been destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba.”"
Numbers,21,31,So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,"After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,21,33,"Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"The LORD said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land."
Numbers,22,1,Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,"Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,"
Numbers,22,3,"and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites."
Numbers,22,4,"The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,"
Numbers,22,5,"sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said: “A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me."
Numbers,22,6,"Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”"
Numbers,22,7,"The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said."
Numbers,22,8,"“Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them, “and I will report back to you with the answer the LORD gives me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with him."
Numbers,22,9,"God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:"
Numbers,22,11,‘A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.’”
Numbers,22,12,"But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.”"
Numbers,22,13,"The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,"Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first."
Numbers,22,16,"They came to Balaam and said: “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,"
Numbers,22,17,because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.”
Numbers,22,18,"But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God."
Numbers,22,19,Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the LORD will tell me.”
Numbers,22,20,"That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.”"
Numbers,22,21,"Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials."
Numbers,22,22,"But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road."
Numbers,22,24,"Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides."
Numbers,22,25,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again."
Numbers,22,26,"Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left."
Numbers,22,27,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff."
Numbers,22,28,"Then the LORD opened the donkey’s mouth, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.”"
Numbers,22,30,"The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said."
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown."
Numbers,22,32,"The angel of the LORD asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me."
Numbers,22,33,"The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it.”"
Numbers,22,34,"Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.”"
Numbers,22,35,"The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials."
Numbers,22,36,"When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory."
Numbers,22,37,"Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?”"
Numbers,22,38,"“Well, I have come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.”"
Numbers,22,39,Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.
Numbers,22,40,"Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp."
Numbers,23,1,"Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”"
Numbers,23,2,"Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height."
Numbers,23,4,"God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”"
Numbers,23,5,"The LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.”"
Numbers,23,6,"So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials."
Numbers,23,7,"Then Balaam spoke his message: “Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. ‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.’"
Numbers,23,8,How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?
Numbers,23,9,"From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations."
Numbers,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!”"
Numbers,23,11,"Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”"
Numbers,23,12,"He answered, “Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me.”"
Numbers,23,14,"So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"The LORD met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.”"
Numbers,23,17,"So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, “What did the LORD say?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Then he spoke his message: “Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor."
Numbers,23,19,"God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?"
Numbers,23,20,"I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it."
Numbers,23,21,"“No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them."
Numbers,23,22,God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
Numbers,23,23,"There is no divination against Jacob, no evil omens against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’"
Numbers,23,24,The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims.”
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”"
Numbers,23,26,"Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,"And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland."
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”"
Numbers,23,30,"Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,"When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him"
Numbers,24,3,"and he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,"
Numbers,24,4,"the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:"
Numbers,24,5,"“How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel!"
Numbers,24,6,"“Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters."
Numbers,24,7,Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. “Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.
Numbers,24,8,“God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.
Numbers,24,9,"Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse them? “May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!”"
Numbers,24,10,"Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded.”"
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,"
Numbers,24,13,"‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD—and I must say only what the LORD says’?"
Numbers,24,14,"Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.”"
Numbers,24,15,"Then he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,"
Numbers,24,16,"the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:"
Numbers,24,17,"“I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the people of Sheth."
Numbers,24,18,"Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong."
Numbers,24,19,A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.”
Numbers,24,20,"Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message: “Amalek was first among the nations, but their end will be utter destruction.”"
Numbers,24,21,"Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message: “Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;"
Numbers,24,22,yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Ashur takes you captive.”
Numbers,24,23,Then he spoke his message: “Alas! Who can live when God does this?
Numbers,24,24,"Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus; they will subdue Ashur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin.”"
Numbers,24,25,"Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way."
Numbers,25,1,"While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,"
Numbers,25,2,who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods.
Numbers,25,3,So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the LORD’s anger burned against them.
Numbers,25,4,"The LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the LORD’s fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”"
Numbers,25,5,"So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.”"
Numbers,25,6,Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,25,7,"When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand"
Numbers,25,8,"and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped;"
Numbers,25,9,"but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000."
Numbers,25,10,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal."
Numbers,25,12,Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him.
Numbers,25,13,"He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”"
Numbers,25,14,"The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family."
Numbers,25,15,"And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family."
Numbers,25,16,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,25,17,“Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them.
Numbers,25,18,"They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.”"
Numbers,26,1,"After the plague the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,"
Numbers,26,2,“Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families—all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.”
Numbers,26,3,"So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said,"
Numbers,26,4,"“Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the LORD commanded Moses.” These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt:"
Numbers,26,5,"The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were: through Hanok, the Hanokite clan; through Pallu, the Palluite clan;"
Numbers,26,6,"through Hezron, the Hezronite clan; through Karmi, the Karmite clan."
Numbers,26,7,"These were the clans of Reuben; those numbered were 43,730."
Numbers,26,8,"The son of Pallu was Eliab,"
Numbers,26,9,"and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korah’s followers when they rebelled against the LORD."
Numbers,26,10,"The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning sign."
Numbers,26,11,"The line of Korah, however, did not die out."

Numbers,26,52,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,26,53,“The land is to be allotted to them as an inheritance based on the number of names.
Numbers,26,54,"To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one; each is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those listed."
Numbers,26,55,Be sure that the land is distributed by lot. What each group inherits will be according to the names for its ancestral tribe.
Numbers,26,56,Each inheritance is to be distributed by lot among the larger and smaller groups.”
Numbers,26,57,"These were the Levites who were counted by their clans: through Gershon, the Gershonite clan; through Kohath, the Kohathite clan; through Merari, the Merarite clan."
Numbers,26,58,"These also were Levite clans: the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, the Korahite clan. (Kohath was the forefather of Amram;"

Numbers,26,62,"All the male Levites a month old or more numbered 23,000. They were not counted along with the other Israelites because they received no inheritance among them."
Numbers,26,63,These are the ones counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they counted the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Numbers,26,64,Not one of them was among those counted by Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the Israelites in the Desert of Sinai.
Numbers,26,65,"For the LORD had told those Israelites they would surely die in the wilderness, and not one of them was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. They came forward"
Numbers,27,2,"and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,"
Numbers,27,3,"“Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among Korah’s followers, who banded together against the LORD, but he died for his own sin and left no sons."
Numbers,27,4,Why should our father’s name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.”
Numbers,27,5,"So Moses brought their case before the LORD,"
Numbers,27,6,"and the LORD said to him,"
Numbers,27,7,“What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father’s relatives and give their father’s inheritance to them.
Numbers,27,8,"“Say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance to his daughter."
Numbers,27,9,"If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers."
Numbers,27,10,"If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers."
Numbers,27,11,"If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to have the force of law for the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.’”"
Numbers,27,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range and see the land I have given the Israelites."
Numbers,27,13,"After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,"
Numbers,27,14,"for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes.” (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)"
Numbers,27,15,"Moses said to the LORD,"
Numbers,27,16,"“May the LORD, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over this community"
Numbers,27,17,"to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the LORD’s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18,"So the LORD said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership, and lay your hand on him."
Numbers,27,19,Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence.
Numbers,27,20,Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him.
Numbers,27,21,"He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the LORD. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in.”"
Numbers,27,22,Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.
Numbers,27,23,"Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the LORD instructed through Moses."
Numbers,28,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,28,2,"“Give this command to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Make sure that you present to me at the appointed time my food offerings, as an aroma pleasing to me.’"
Numbers,28,3,"Say to them: ‘This is the food offering you are to present to the LORD: two lambs a year old without defect, as a regular burnt offering each day."
Numbers,28,4,"Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight,"
Numbers,28,5,together with a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives.
Numbers,28,6,"This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD."
Numbers,28,7,The accompanying drink offering is to be a quarter of a hin of fermented drink with each lamb. Pour out the drink offering to the LORD at the sanctuary.
Numbers,28,8,"Offer the second lamb at twilight, along with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering that you offer in the morning. This is a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."
Numbers,28,9,"“‘On the Sabbath day, make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect, together with its drink offering and a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil."
Numbers,28,10,"This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering."
Numbers,28,11,"“‘On the first of every month, present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect."
Numbers,28,12,"With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil;"
Numbers,28,13,"and with each lamb, a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil. This is for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD."
Numbers,28,14,"With each bull there is to be a drink offering of half a hin of wine; with the ram, a third of a hin; and with each lamb, a quarter of a hin. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon during the year."
Numbers,28,15,"Besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering."
Numbers,28,16,“‘On the fourteenth day of the first month the LORD’s Passover is to be held.

Numbers,29,40,Moses told the Israelites all that the LORD commanded him.
Numbers,30,1,Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: “This is what the LORD commands:
Numbers,30,2,"When a man makes a vow to the LORD or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said."
Numbers,30,3,“When a young woman still living in her father’s household makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a pledge
Numbers,30,4,"and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand."
Numbers,30,5,"But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the LORD will release her because her father has forbidden her."
Numbers,30,6,“If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself
Numbers,30,7,"and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her, then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand."
Numbers,30,8,"But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it, he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself, and the LORD will release her."
Numbers,30,9,“Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her.
Numbers,30,10,“If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath
Numbers,30,11,"and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid her, then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand."
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them, then none of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will release her."
Numbers,30,13,Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself.
Numbers,30,14,"But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them."
Numbers,30,15,"If, however, he nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then he must bear the consequences of her wrongdoing.”"
Numbers,30,16,"These are the regulations the LORD gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter still living at home."
Numbers,31,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,31,2,"“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”"
Numbers,31,3,"So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the LORD’s vengeance on them."
Numbers,31,4,Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.”
Numbers,31,5,"So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel."
Numbers,31,6,"Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling."
Numbers,31,7,"They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man."
Numbers,31,8,"Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,"The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder."
Numbers,31,10,"They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps."
Numbers,31,11,"They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals,"
Numbers,31,12,"and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,"Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp."
Numbers,31,14,Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle.
Numbers,31,15,“Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them.
Numbers,31,16,"“They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the LORD in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the LORD’s people."
Numbers,31,17,"Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,"
Numbers,31,18,but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
Numbers,31,19,“Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.
Numbers,31,20,"Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.”"
Numbers,31,21,"Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is what is required by the law that the LORD gave Moses:"
Numbers,31,22,"Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead"
Numbers,31,23,"and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water."
Numbers,31,24,On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.”
Numbers,31,25,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,31,26,“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
Numbers,31,27,Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
Numbers,31,28,"From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep."
Numbers,31,29,Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the LORD’s part.
Numbers,31,30,"From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD’s tabernacle.”"
Numbers,31,31,So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,"
Numbers,31,33,"72,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,34,"61,000 donkeys"
Numbers,31,35,"and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man."
Numbers,31,36,"The half share of those who fought in the battle was: 337,500 sheep,"
Numbers,31,37,of which the tribute for the LORD was 675;
Numbers,31,38,"36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the LORD was 72;"
Numbers,31,39,"30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the LORD was 61;"
Numbers,31,40,"16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the LORD was 32."
Numbers,31,41,"Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD’s part, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men—"
Numbers,31,43,"the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep,"
Numbers,31,44,"36,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"30,500 donkeys"
Numbers,31,46,"and 16,000 people."
Numbers,31,47,"From the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD’s tabernacle."
Numbers,31,48,Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses
Numbers,31,49,"and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing."
Numbers,31,50,"So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”"
Numbers,31,51,Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted articles.
Numbers,31,52,"All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels."
Numbers,31,53,Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.
Numbers,31,54,Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
Numbers,32,1,"The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock."
Numbers,32,2,"So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,"
Numbers,32,3,"“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon—"
Numbers,32,4,"the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock."
Numbers,32,5,"If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,6,"Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here?"
Numbers,32,7,Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the LORD has given them?
Numbers,32,8,This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.
Numbers,32,9,"After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them."
Numbers,32,10,The LORD’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:
Numbers,32,11,"‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—"
Numbers,32,12,"not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.’"
Numbers,32,13,"The LORD’s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone."
Numbers,32,14,"“And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel."
Numbers,32,15,"If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”"
Numbers,32,16,"Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children."
Numbers,32,17,"But we will arm ourselves for battle and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,"We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,20,"Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle"
Numbers,32,21,and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before him—
Numbers,32,22,"then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD."
Numbers,32,23,"“But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out."
Numbers,32,24,"Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”"
Numbers,32,25,"The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as our lord commands."
Numbers,32,26,"Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead."
Numbers,32,27,"But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says.”"
Numbers,32,28,Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.
Numbers,32,29,"He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession."
Numbers,32,30,"But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.”"
Numbers,32,31,"The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the LORD has said."
Numbers,32,32,"We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,33,"Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around them."
Numbers,32,34,"The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,"
Numbers,32,35,"Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,"
Numbers,32,36,"Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks."
Numbers,32,37,"And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim,"
Numbers,32,38,as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
Numbers,32,39,"The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there."
Numbers,32,41,"Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair."
Numbers,32,42,And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.
Numbers,33,1,Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,33,2,At the LORD’s command Moses recorded the stages in their journey. This is their journey by stages:
Numbers,33,3,"The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians,"
Numbers,33,4,"who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had brought judgment on their gods."
Numbers,33,5,The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Sukkoth.
Numbers,33,6,"They left Sukkoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert."
Numbers,33,7,"They left Etham, turned back to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,"They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the sea into the desert, and when they had traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham, they camped at Marah."
Numbers,33,9,"They left Marah and went to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there."
Numbers,33,10,They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers,33,11,They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
Numbers,33,13,They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.
Numbers,33,14,"They left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink."
Numbers,33,15,They left Rephidim and camped in the Desert of Sinai.
Numbers,33,16,They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
Numbers,33,17,They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
Numbers,33,19,They left Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez.
Numbers,33,20,They left Rimmon Perez and camped at Libnah.
Numbers,33,21,They left Libnah and camped at Rissah.
Numbers,33,22,They left Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
Numbers,33,23,They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
Numbers,33,24,They left Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
Numbers,33,25,They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,They left Tahath and camped at Terah.
Numbers,33,28,They left Terah and camped at Mithkah.
Numbers,33,29,They left Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
Numbers,33,30,They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
Numbers,33,31,They left Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan.
Numbers,33,32,They left Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Haggidgad.
Numbers,33,33,They left Hor Haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers,33,34,They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers,33,35,They left Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber.
Numbers,33,36,"They left Ezion Geber and camped at Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin."
Numbers,33,37,"They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the border of Edom."
Numbers,33,38,"At the LORD’s command Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor, where he died on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt."
Numbers,33,39,Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,"The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming."
Numbers,33,41,They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,They left Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers,33,43,They left Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,33,44,"They left Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, on the border of Moab."
Numbers,33,45,They left Iye Abarim and camped at Dibon Gad.
Numbers,33,46,They left Dibon Gad and camped at Almon Diblathaim.
Numbers,33,47,"They left Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, near Nebo."
Numbers,33,48,They left the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Numbers,33,49,There on the plains of Moab they camped along the Jordan from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.
Numbers,33,50,"On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,33,51,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,"
Numbers,33,52,"drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and their cast idols, and demolish all their high places."
Numbers,33,53,"Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess."
Numbers,33,54,"Distribute the land by lot, according to your clans. To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one. Whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs. Distribute it according to your ancestral tribes."
Numbers,33,55,"“‘But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live."
Numbers,33,56,And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.’”
Numbers,34,1,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,34,2,"“Command the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter Canaan, the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance is to have these boundaries:"
Numbers,34,3,"“‘Your southern side will include some of the Desert of Zin along the border of Edom. Your southern boundary will start in the east from the southern end of the Dead Sea,"
Numbers,34,4,"cross south of Scorpion Pass, continue on to Zin and go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon,"
Numbers,34,5,"where it will turn, join the Wadi of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea."
Numbers,34,6,“‘Your western boundary will be the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your boundary on the west.
Numbers,34,7,"“‘For your northern boundary, run a line from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor"
Numbers,34,8,"and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the boundary will go to Zedad,"
Numbers,34,9,continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary on the north.
Numbers,34,10,"“‘For your eastern boundary, run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham."
Numbers,34,11,The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Galilee.
Numbers,34,12,"Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. “‘This will be your land, with its boundaries on every side.’”"
Numbers,34,13,"Moses commanded the Israelites: “Assign this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has ordered that it be given to the nine and a half tribes,"
Numbers,34,14,"because the families of the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance."
Numbers,34,15,"These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance east of the Jordan across from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”"
Numbers,34,16,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,34,17,“These are the names of the men who are to assign the land for you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
Numbers,34,18,And appoint one leader from each tribe to help assign the land.
Numbers,34,19,"These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;"
Numbers,34,20,"Shemuel son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Simeon;"
Numbers,34,21,"Elidad son of Kislon, from the tribe of Benjamin;"
Numbers,34,22,"Bukki son of Jogli, the leader from the tribe of Dan;"
Numbers,34,23,"Hanniel son of Ephod, the leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;"
Numbers,34,24,"Kemuel son of Shiphtan, the leader from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph;"
Numbers,34,25,"Elizaphan son of Parnak, the leader from the tribe of Zebulun;"
Numbers,34,26,"Paltiel son of Azzan, the leader from the tribe of Issachar;"
Numbers,34,27,"Ahihud son of Shelomi, the leader from the tribe of Asher;"
Numbers,34,28,"Pedahel son of Ammihud, the leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”"
Numbers,34,29,These are the men the LORD commanded to assign the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,"On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,35,2,“Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns.
Numbers,35,3,Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for the cattle they own and all their other animals.
Numbers,35,4,“The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits from the town wall.
Numbers,35,5,"Outside the town, measure two thousand cubits on the east side, two thousand on the south side, two thousand on the west and two thousand on the north, with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns."
Numbers,35,6,"“Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition, give them forty-two other towns."
Numbers,35,7,"In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns, together with their pasturelands."
Numbers,35,8,"The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few.”"
Numbers,35,9,Then the LORD said to Moses:
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,"
Numbers,35,11,"select some towns to be your cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee."
Numbers,35,12,"They will be places of refuge from the avenger, so that anyone accused of murder may not die before they stand trial before the assembly."
Numbers,35,13,These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,14,Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,15,"These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners residing among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there."
Numbers,35,16,"“‘If anyone strikes someone a fatal blow with an iron object, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"Or if anyone is holding a stone and strikes someone a fatal blow with it, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"Or if anyone is holding a wooden object and strikes someone a fatal blow with it, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,"The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when the avenger comes upon the murderer, the avenger shall put the murderer to death."
Numbers,35,20,If anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at them intentionally so that they die
Numbers,35,21,"or if out of enmity one person hits another with their fist so that the other dies, that person is to be put to death; that person is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when they meet."
Numbers,35,22,“‘But if without enmity someone suddenly pushes another or throws something at them unintentionally
Numbers,35,23,"or, without seeing them, drops on them a stone heavy enough to kill them, and they die, then since that other person was not an enemy and no harm was intended,"
Numbers,35,24,the assembly must judge between the accused and the avenger of blood according to these regulations.
Numbers,35,25,"The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send the accused back to the city of refuge to which they fled. The accused must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,“‘But if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which they fled
Numbers,35,27,"and the avenger of blood finds them outside the city, the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder."
Numbers,35,28,The accused must stay in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest may they return to their own property.
Numbers,35,29,"“‘This is to have the force of law for you throughout the generations to come, wherever you live."
Numbers,35,30,“‘Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
Numbers,35,31,"“‘Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer, who deserves to die. They are to be put to death."
Numbers,35,32,“‘Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow them to go back and live on their own land before the death of the high priest.
Numbers,35,33,"“‘Do not pollute the land where you are. Bloodshed pollutes the land, and atonement cannot be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell, for I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.’”"
Numbers,36,1,"The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families."
Numbers,36,2,"They said, “When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.
Numbers,36,4,"When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.”"
Numbers,36,5,Then at the LORD’s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: “What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.
Numbers,36,6,This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father’s tribal clan.
Numbers,36,7,"No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors."
Numbers,36,8,"Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors."
Numbers,36,9,"No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.”"
Numbers,36,10,So Zelophehad’s daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,36,11,"Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins on their father’s side."
Numbers,36,12,"They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father’s tribe and clan."
Numbers,36,13,These are the commands and regulations the LORD gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)
Deuteronomy,1,3,"In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the LORD swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone."
Deuteronomy,1,10,The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.”"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.”"
Deuteronomy,1,18,And at that time I told you everything you were to do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.”"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,1,26,But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You grumbled in your tents and said, “The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’”"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.”"
Deuteronomy,1,32,"In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"“No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.”"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, “You shall not enter it, either."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.”"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you replied, “We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"But the LORD said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD’s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.
Deuteronomy,2,1,"Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea, as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"Then the LORD said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,“You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own."
Deuteronomy,2,6,You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’”
Deuteronomy,2,7,"The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything."
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Then the LORD said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,"And the LORD said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,The LORD’s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.
Deuteronomy,2,16,"Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"the LORD said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,“Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites."
Deuteronomy,2,21,"They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”
Deuteronomy,2,26,"From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,“Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot—
Deuteronomy,2,29,"as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"The LORD said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”"
Deuteronomy,2,32,"When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,"
Deuteronomy,2,33,"the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them—men, women and children. We left no survivors."
Deuteronomy,2,35,But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"The LORD said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city—men, women and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon."
Deuteronomy,3,9,(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)
Deuteronomy,3,10,"We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
Deuteronomy,3,12,"Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gilead to Makir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites."
Deuteronomy,3,17,"Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"I commanded you at that time: “The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the LORD gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.”"
Deuteronomy,3,21,At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.
Deuteronomy,3,22,Do not be afraid of them; the LORD your God himself will fight for you.”
Deuteronomy,3,23,At that time I pleaded with the LORD:
Deuteronomy,3,24,"“Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.”
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But because of you the LORD was angry with me and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the LORD said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.”"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"You saw with your own eyes what the LORD did at Baal Peor. The LORD your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,"
Deuteronomy,4,4,but all of you who held fast to the LORD your God are still alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the LORD my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”"
Deuteronomy,4,7,What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the LORD our God is near us whenever we pray to him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when he said to me, “Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children.”"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness."
Deuteronomy,4,12,Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
Deuteronomy,4,13,"He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets."
Deuteronomy,4,14,And the LORD directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
Deuteronomy,4,15,"You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But as for you, the LORD took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance."
Deuteronomy,4,22,I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden.
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and arousing his anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.
Deuteronomy,4,27,"The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and obey him."
Deuteronomy,4,31,"For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other.
Deuteronomy,4,36,"From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,4,39,Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the LORD your God gives you for all time."
Deuteronomy,4,41,"Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan,"
Deuteronomy,4,42,to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life.
Deuteronomy,4,43,"The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan."
Deuteronomy,4,48,"This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),"
Deuteronomy,4,49,"and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses summoned all Israel and said: Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"It was not with our ancestors that the LORD made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The LORD spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
Deuteronomy,5,5,"(At that time I stood between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said:"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
Deuteronomy,5,7,“You shall have no other gods before me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,"“You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"“Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do."
Deuteronomy,5,15,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
Deuteronomy,5,16,"“Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,“You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,“You shall not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,“You shall not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”"
Deuteronomy,5,22,"These are the commandments the LORD proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me."
Deuteronomy,5,24,"And you said, “The LORD our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then tell us whatever the LORD our God tells you. We will listen and obey.”
Deuteronomy,5,28,"The LORD heard you when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, “I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good."
Deuteronomy,5,29,"Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!"
Deuteronomy,5,30,"“Go, tell them to return to their tents."
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.”"
Deuteronomy,5,32,So be careful to do what the LORD your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy,5,33,"Walk in obedience to all that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"These are the commands, decrees and laws the LORD your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,"
Deuteronomy,6,2,"so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the LORD your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."
Deuteronomy,6,5,Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
Deuteronomy,6,6,These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts.
Deuteronomy,6,7,"Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up."
Deuteronomy,6,8,Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
Deuteronomy,6,9,Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build,"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied,"
Deuteronomy,6,12,"be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
Deuteronomy,6,13,"Fear the LORD your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name."
Deuteronomy,6,14,"Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;"
Deuteronomy,6,15,"for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land."
Deuteronomy,6,16,Do not put the LORD your God to the test as you did at Massah.
Deuteronomy,6,17,Be sure to keep the commands of the LORD your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you.
Deuteronomy,6,18,"Do what is right and good in the LORD’s sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the LORD promised on oath to your ancestors,"
Deuteronomy,6,19,"thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the LORD said."
Deuteronomy,6,20,"In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the LORD our God has commanded you?”"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"tell him: “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,6,22,Before our eyes the LORD sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household.
Deuteronomy,6,23,But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors.
Deuteronomy,6,24,"The LORD commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the LORD our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today."
Deuteronomy,6,25,"And if we are careful to obey all this law before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.”"
Deuteronomy,7,1,"When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you—"
Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy."
Deuteronomy,7,3,"Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,"
Deuteronomy,7,4,"for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the LORD’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you."
Deuteronomy,7,5,"This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire."
Deuteronomy,7,6,"For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession."
Deuteronomy,7,7,"The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples."
Deuteronomy,7,8,"But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments."
Deuteronomy,7,10,But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
Deuteronomy,7,11,"Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today."
Deuteronomy,7,12,"If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the LORD your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,7,13,"He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,"You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young."
Deuteronomy,7,15,"The LORD will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you."
Deuteronomy,7,16,"You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?”"
Deuteronomy,7,18,But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
Deuteronomy,7,19,"You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear."
Deuteronomy,7,20,"Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished."
Deuteronomy,7,21,"Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God."
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The LORD your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,"But the LORD your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed."
Deuteronomy,7,24,"He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them."
Deuteronomy,7,25,"The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the LORD promised on oath to your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,8,2,"Remember how the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands."
Deuteronomy,8,3,"He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,8,4,Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
Deuteronomy,8,5,"Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you."
Deuteronomy,8,6,"Observe the commands of the LORD your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him."
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills;"
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey;"
Deuteronomy,8,9,a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.
Deuteronomy,8,10,"When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given you."
Deuteronomy,8,11,"Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day."
Deuteronomy,8,12,"Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,"
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,"
Deuteronomy,8,14,"then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
Deuteronomy,8,15,"He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock."
Deuteronomy,8,16,"He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you."
Deuteronomy,8,17,"You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.”"
Deuteronomy,8,18,"But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,8,19,"If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,8,20,"Like the nations the LORD destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,9,1,"Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky."
Deuteronomy,9,2,The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?”
Deuteronomy,9,3,"But be assured today that the LORD your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the LORD has promised you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, “The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,"Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the LORD your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD."
Deuteronomy,9,8,At Horeb you aroused the LORD’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,"The LORD gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the LORD proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly."
Deuteronomy,9,11,"At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"Then the LORD told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.”"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"And the LORD said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!"
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.”"
Deuteronomy,9,15,So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
Deuteronomy,9,16,"When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you."
Deuteronomy,9,17,"So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes."
Deuteronomy,9,18,"Then once again I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD’s sight and so arousing his anger."
Deuteronomy,9,19,"I feared the anger and wrath of the LORD, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the LORD listened to me."
Deuteronomy,9,20,"And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too."
Deuteronomy,9,21,"Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,22,"You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not trust him or obey him."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed to the LORD and said, “Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the LORD was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.”"
Deuteronomy,10,1,"At that time the LORD said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.”"
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands."
Deuteronomy,10,4,"The LORD wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,10,5,"Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD commanded me, and they are there now."
Deuteronomy,10,6,"(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest."
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the LORD is their inheritance, as the LORD your God told them.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,"Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the LORD listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"“Go,” the LORD said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.”"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,10,13,and to observe the LORD’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?
Deuteronomy,10,14,"To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"Yet the LORD set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today."
Deuteronomy,10,16,"Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer."
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,Fear the LORD your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"Love the LORD your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and his commands always."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the LORD your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm;"
Deuteronomy,11,3,"the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country;"
Deuteronomy,11,4,"what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea as they were pursuing you, and how the LORD brought lasting ruin on them."
Deuteronomy,11,5,"It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place,"
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them."
Deuteronomy,11,7,But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the LORD has done.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and so that you may live long in the land the LORD swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden."
Deuteronomy,11,11,But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven.
Deuteronomy,11,12,It is a land the LORD your God cares for; the eyes of the LORD your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.
Deuteronomy,11,13,So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul—
Deuteronomy,11,14,"then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,"I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied."
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them."
Deuteronomy,11,17,"Then the LORD’s anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the LORD is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
Deuteronomy,11,19,"Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up."
Deuteronomy,11,20,"Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the LORD swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him—"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No one will be able to stand against you. The LORD your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse—"
Deuteronomy,11,27,the blessing if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today;
Deuteronomy,11,28,"the curse if you disobey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"When the LORD your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal."
Deuteronomy,11,31,"You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there,"
Deuteronomy,11,32,be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy,12,1,"These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess—as long as you live in the land."
Deuteronomy,12,2,"Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods."
Deuteronomy,12,3,"Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places."
Deuteronomy,12,4,You must not worship the LORD your God in their way.
Deuteronomy,12,5,But you are to seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;
Deuteronomy,12,6,"there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"There, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the LORD your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,"You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit,"
Deuteronomy,12,9,since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety."
Deuteronomy,12,11,"Then to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"And there rejoice before the LORD your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.
Deuteronomy,12,14,"Offer them only at the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you."
Deuteronomy,12,15,"Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the LORD your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it."
Deuteronomy,12,16,But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you put your hand to."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"When the LORD your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may eat as much of it as you want."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want."
Deuteronomy,12,22,Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat.
Deuteronomy,12,23,"But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,24,You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,"Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,26,"But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the LORD will choose."
Deuteronomy,12,27,"Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,28,"Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,12,29,"The LORD your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land,"
Deuteronomy,12,30,"and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.”"
Deuteronomy,12,31,"You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods."
Deuteronomy,12,32,See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.
Deuteronomy,13,1,"If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder,"
Deuteronomy,13,2,"and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,”"
Deuteronomy,13,3,you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy,13,4,"It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him."
Deuteronomy,13,5,"That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you."
Deuteronomy,13,6,"If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known,"
Deuteronomy,13,7,"gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other),"
Deuteronomy,13,8,do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them.
Deuteronomy,13,9,"You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people."
Deuteronomy,13,10,"Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
Deuteronomy,13,11,"Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again."
Deuteronomy,13,12,If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in
Deuteronomy,13,13,"that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods you have not known),"
Deuteronomy,13,14,"then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you,"
Deuteronomy,13,15,"you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must destroy it completely, both its people and its livestock."
Deuteronomy,13,16,"You are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt,"
Deuteronomy,13,17,"and none of the condemned things are to be found in your hands. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger, will show you mercy, and will have compassion on you. He will increase your numbers, as he promised on oath to your ancestors—"
Deuteronomy,13,18,because you obey the LORD your God by keeping all his commands that I am giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes.
Deuteronomy,14,1,"You are the children of the LORD your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead,"
Deuteronomy,14,2,"for you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the LORD has chosen you to be his treasured possession."
Deuteronomy,14,3,Do not eat any detestable thing.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud.
Deuteronomy,14,7,"However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses."
Deuteronomy,14,9,"Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales."
Deuteronomy,14,10,But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean.
Deuteronomy,14,11,You may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,"
Deuteronomy,14,13,"the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon,"
Deuteronomy,14,14,"any kind of raven,"
Deuteronomy,14,15,"the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,"
Deuteronomy,14,16,"the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,"
Deuteronomy,14,17,"the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,"
Deuteronomy,14,18,"the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat."
Deuteronomy,14,19,All flying insects are unclean to you; do not eat them.
Deuteronomy,14,20,But any winged creature that is clean you may eat.
Deuteronomy,14,21,"Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in any of your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to any other foreigner. But you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always."
Deuteronomy,14,24,"But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the LORD your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the LORD will choose to put his Name is so far away),"
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the LORD your God will choose."
Deuteronomy,14,26,"Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice."
Deuteronomy,14,27,"And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own."
Deuteronomy,14,28,"At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns,"
Deuteronomy,14,29,"so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands."
Deuteronomy,15,1,At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
Deuteronomy,15,2,"This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the LORD’s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed."
Deuteronomy,15,3,"You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you."
Deuteronomy,15,4,"However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you,"
Deuteronomy,15,5,if only you fully obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy,15,6,"For the LORD your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you."
Deuteronomy,15,7,"If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them."
Deuteronomy,15,8,"Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need."
Deuteronomy,15,9,"Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be found guilty of sin."
Deuteronomy,15,10,Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
Deuteronomy,15,11,There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.
Deuteronomy,15,12,"If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free."
Deuteronomy,15,13,"And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed."
Deuteronomy,15,14,"Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the LORD your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,15,15,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.
Deuteronomy,15,16,"But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and is well off with you,"
Deuteronomy,15,17,"then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant."
Deuteronomy,15,18,"Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,15,19,"Set apart for the LORD your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep."
Deuteronomy,15,20,Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose.
Deuteronomy,15,21,"If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,15,22,"You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer."
Deuteronomy,15,23,But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,16,1,"Observe the month of Aviv and celebrate the Passover of the LORD your God, because in the month of Aviv he brought you out of Egypt by night."
Deuteronomy,16,2,Sacrifice as the Passover to the LORD your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the LORD will choose as a dwelling for his Name.
Deuteronomy,16,3,"Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt."
Deuteronomy,16,4,Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning.
Deuteronomy,16,5,You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the LORD your God gives you
Deuteronomy,16,6,"except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt."
Deuteronomy,16,7,Roast it and eat it at the place the LORD your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents.
Deuteronomy,16,8,For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the LORD your God and do no work.
Deuteronomy,16,9,Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
Deuteronomy,16,10,Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the LORD your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the LORD your God has given you.
Deuteronomy,16,11,"And rejoice before the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your towns, and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows living among you."
Deuteronomy,16,12,"Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees."
Deuteronomy,16,13,Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.
Deuteronomy,16,14,"Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns."
Deuteronomy,16,15,"For seven days celebrate the festival to the LORD your God at the place the LORD will choose. For the LORD your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete."
Deuteronomy,16,16,"Three times a year all your men must appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed:"
Deuteronomy,16,17,Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the LORD your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy,16,18,"Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the LORD your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly."
Deuteronomy,16,19,"Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent."
Deuteronomy,16,20,"Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the LORD your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,16,21,"Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the LORD your God,"
Deuteronomy,16,22,"and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the LORD your God hates."
Deuteronomy,17,1,"Do not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to him."
Deuteronomy,17,2,"If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the LORD gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God in violation of his covenant,"
Deuteronomy,17,3,"and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky,"
Deuteronomy,17,4,"and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,"
Deuteronomy,17,5,take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death.
Deuteronomy,17,6,"On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness."
Deuteronomy,17,7,"The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you."
Deuteronomy,17,8,"If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge—whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the place the LORD your God will choose."
Deuteronomy,17,9,Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict.
Deuteronomy,17,10,You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do.
Deuteronomy,17,11,"Act according to whatever they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left."
Deuteronomy,17,12,Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the LORD your God is to be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy,17,13,"All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again."
Deuteronomy,17,14,"When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,”"
Deuteronomy,17,15,"be sure to appoint over you a king the LORD your God chooses. He must be from among your fellow Israelites. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not an Israelite."
Deuteronomy,17,16,"The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD has told you, “You are not to go back that way again.”"
Deuteronomy,17,17,"He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold."
Deuteronomy,17,18,"When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests."
Deuteronomy,17,19,"It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees"
Deuteronomy,17,20,and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
Deuteronomy,18,1,"The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the LORD, for that is their inheritance."
Deuteronomy,18,2,"They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them."
Deuteronomy,18,3,"This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head."
Deuteronomy,18,4,"You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep,"
Deuteronomy,18,5,for the LORD your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the LORD’s name always.
Deuteronomy,18,6,"If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose,"
Deuteronomy,18,7,he may minister in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the LORD.
Deuteronomy,18,8,"He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions."
Deuteronomy,18,9,"When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there."
Deuteronomy,18,10,"Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,"
Deuteronomy,18,11,"or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead."
Deuteronomy,18,12,Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD; because of these same detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you.
Deuteronomy,18,13,You must be blameless before the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,18,14,"The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so."
Deuteronomy,18,15,"The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him."
Deuteronomy,18,16,"For this is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.”"
Deuteronomy,18,17,The LORD said to me: “What they say is good.
Deuteronomy,18,18,"I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him."
Deuteronomy,18,19,I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name.
Deuteronomy,18,20,"But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.”"
Deuteronomy,18,21,"You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?”"
Deuteronomy,18,22,"If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed."
Deuteronomy,19,1,"When the LORD your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses,"
Deuteronomy,19,2,then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
Deuteronomy,19,3,"Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities."
Deuteronomy,19,4,"This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought."
Deuteronomy,19,5,"For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life."
Deuteronomy,19,6,"Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought."
Deuteronomy,19,7,This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.
Deuteronomy,19,8,"If the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them,"
Deuteronomy,19,9,because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love the LORD your God and to walk always in obedience to him—then you are to set aside three more cities.
Deuteronomy,19,10,"Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed."
Deuteronomy,19,11,"But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities,"
Deuteronomy,19,12,"the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die."
Deuteronomy,19,13,"Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you."
Deuteronomy,19,14,Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
Deuteronomy,19,15,One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Deuteronomy,19,16,"If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime,"
Deuteronomy,19,17,the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time.
Deuteronomy,19,18,"The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite,"
Deuteronomy,19,19,then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy,19,20,"The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you."
Deuteronomy,19,21,"Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
Deuteronomy,20,1,"When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you."
Deuteronomy,20,2,"When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army."
Deuteronomy,20,3,"He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them."
Deuteronomy,20,4,For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.”
Deuteronomy,20,5,"The officers shall say to the army: “Has anyone built a new house and not yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may begin to live in it."
Deuteronomy,20,6,"Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it."
Deuteronomy,20,7,"Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.”"
Deuteronomy,20,8,"Then the officers shall add, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.”"
Deuteronomy,20,9,"When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it."
Deuteronomy,20,10,"When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace."
Deuteronomy,20,11,"If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you."
Deuteronomy,20,12,"If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city."
Deuteronomy,20,13,"When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it."
Deuteronomy,20,14,"As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies."
Deuteronomy,20,15,This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.
Deuteronomy,20,16,"However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes."
Deuteronomy,20,17,"Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,20,18,"Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them?"
Deuteronomy,20,20,"However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls."
Deuteronomy,21,1,"If someone is found slain, lying in a field in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who the killer was,"
Deuteronomy,21,2,your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns.
Deuteronomy,21,3,Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke
Deuteronomy,21,4,and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer’s neck.
Deuteronomy,21,5,"The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the LORD and to decide all cases of dispute and assault."
Deuteronomy,21,6,"Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,"
Deuteronomy,21,7,"and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done."
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, LORD, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.” Then the bloodshed will be atoned for,"
Deuteronomy,21,9,"and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,21,10,"When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,"
Deuteronomy,21,11,"if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife."
Deuteronomy,21,12,"Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails"
Deuteronomy,21,13,"and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife."
Deuteronomy,21,14,"If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her."
Deuteronomy,21,15,"If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love,"
Deuteronomy,21,16,"when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love."
Deuteronomy,21,17,He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
Deuteronomy,21,18,"If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him,"
Deuteronomy,21,19,his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.
Deuteronomy,21,20,"They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”"
Deuteronomy,21,21,Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.
Deuteronomy,21,22,"If someone guilty of a capital offense is put to death and their body is exposed on a pole,"
Deuteronomy,21,23,"you must not leave the body hanging on the pole overnight. Be sure to bury it that same day, because anyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse. You must not desecrate the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,22,1,"If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to its owner."
Deuteronomy,22,2,"If they do not live near you or if you do not know who owns it, take it home with you and keep it until they come looking for it. Then give it back."
Deuteronomy,22,3,Do the same if you find their donkey or cloak or anything else they have lost. Do not ignore it.
Deuteronomy,22,4,"If you see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help the owner get it to its feet."
Deuteronomy,22,5,"A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this."
Deuteronomy,22,6,"If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young."
Deuteronomy,22,7,"You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life."
Deuteronomy,22,8,"When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof."
Deuteronomy,22,9,"Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled."
Deuteronomy,22,10,Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
Deuteronomy,22,11,Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
Deuteronomy,22,12,Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
Deuteronomy,22,13,"If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her"
Deuteronomy,22,14,"and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,”"
Deuteronomy,22,15,then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin.
Deuteronomy,22,16,"Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her."
Deuteronomy,22,17,"Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town,"
Deuteronomy,22,18,and the elders shall take the man and punish him.
Deuteronomy,22,19,"They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives."
Deuteronomy,22,20,"If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found,"
Deuteronomy,22,21,she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy,22,22,"If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel."
Deuteronomy,22,23,"If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her,"
Deuteronomy,22,24,"you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you."
Deuteronomy,22,25,"But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die."
Deuteronomy,22,26,"Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor,"
Deuteronomy,22,27,"for the man found the young woman out in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her."
Deuteronomy,22,28,"If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered,"
Deuteronomy,22,29,"he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives."
