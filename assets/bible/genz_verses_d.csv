Isaiah,5,1,"Yo, I'm about to drop a lit track dedicated to my beloved babe. Check it, my bae got a dope vineyard on a mad fruitful hill. It's straight fire, no cap. #vineyardgoals #blessed"
Isaiah,5,2,"So he like, protected it by putting up a wall and got rid of all the annoying rocks that were in the way. Then he planted the coolest vines in it and even built a fancy tower right in the middle. Oh, and he also made a legit winepress. He totally expected it to produce some bomb grapes, but instead it ended up producing these weird wild grapes."
Isaiah,5,3,"Yo, people of Jerusalem and dudes from Judah, I'm calling on you to be the judges in this situation between me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"Yo, I did all I could for my vineyard, but yo, it straight up let me down. I was expecting some dope grapes, but instead it gave me these whack wild grapes. Like, what else could I have done to make it better?"
Isaiah,5,5,"Alright, listen up, I'm about to spill the tea on what I'm gonna do to my vineyard: Imma remove the protective hedge around it, so it's gonna get devoured; and I'll demolish the wall, so it's gonna get trampled on. Y'know, like real messed up. #Savage"
Isaiah,5,6,"And I'm gonna totally wreck it: no trimming or digging happening here, only gonna have weeds and prickly stuff growing. Oh, and I'll make sure those clouds don't rain on it too, just you watch."
Isaiah,5,7,"So, like, the LORD's got this sick vineyard called Israel, and the guys in Judah are his awesome plants. He was hoping for fairness and righteousness, but instead, there's all this injustice and sadness. It's a major bummer, dude."
Isaiah,5,8,"Dang, those people who keep adding house after house and field after field, taking up all the space just for themselves! Can't they leave some room for others to live on this planet?!"
Isaiah,5,9,"Yo, the LORD of hosts just straight up told me that for real, a bunch of houses are gonna be abandoned and left all empty, and they're gonna be big and fancy ones too. No cap, this is what I heard from the LORD, like, if things don't change, it's gonna happen."
Isaiah,5,10,"Bruh, like, even if you got mad space, only one little acre of vineyard crops will give you a tiny amount of produce, and the amount of seed you plant in a large area will only give you a small amount in return."
Isaiah,5,11,"Dang, that's a tough break for those who wake up mad early just to chase after some hard drinks, only to keep going all night until they're totally lit up with wine! Like, they're seriously all about that pursuit of getting intoxicated."
Isaiah,5,12,"In their lit parties, they got the harp, the viol, the tabret, the pipes, and plenty of wine. But they straight up ignore the stuff the LORD is doing, not even giving it a second thought."
Isaiah,5,13,"So my squad has been taken captive because they really lack knowledge. And the respected ones are starving, and the whole crew is parched with thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"So, like, hell is totally expanding and opening its mouth wide, like no boundaries whatsoever! And all those glorious and prideful people with their huge crowds and flashy displays, as well as those who live for the good times, are gonna end up going down there."
Isaiah,5,15,"The jerk will get knocked down, the powerful will be humbled, and those who think they're all that will be put in their place:"
Isaiah,5,16,"But the LORD of all the badassery will totally be praised for being fair and just, and God, who's like super holy, will be totally respected because righteousness is dope. {God...: or, like, the holy God: Heb. the God the holy}"
Isaiah,5,17,"And so, like, the cute little lambs can totally chow down in their own awesome way, ya know? And those fancy-pants rich folks, their leftovers will be devoured by random peeps."
Isaiah,5,18,"Dang, those who embrace wickedness like it's some trendy accessory, and sin like it's no big deal."
Isaiah,5,19,"They're like, 'Hurry up and finish your work so we can see it!' We're waiting for the plans of the Holy One of Israel to come closer, so we can understand them!"
Isaiah,5,20,"It's like, seriously messed up when people start calling evil good and good evil. They're out here flipping the switch on darkness and light, treating what's bitter like it's sweet and what's sweet like it's bitter. It's just, like, so twisted, you know?"
Isaiah,5,21,"Oh no, watch out for those who think they're super smart and always act like they know everything! It's like they can't see their own flaws and mistakes even when they're right in front of them!"
Isaiah,5,22,"Dang, those who can chug wine and flex their drinking skills are in for some trouble:"
Isaiah,5,23,"They let evil people off the hook in exchange for favors, and strip away the goodness from those who are truly righteous!"
Isaiah,5,24,"So, like, when fire totally burns up dry grass and flames completely destroy worthless stuff, their whole foundation is gonna be decaying, and their success is just gonna vanish into thin air. And it's all because they've straight-up rejected God's laws and disrespected the teachings of the Almighty God of Israel. #fireemoji #totallyburned"
Isaiah,5,25,"So, like, God's super mad at his peeps and he's totally punishing them. He's like, raising his hand and smacking them real hard. And it's intense, man - even the hills are shaking and dead bodies are all over the streets. And get this, his anger isn't even gone yet, he's still all about that punishment. It's wild, like dung scattered everywhere."
Isaiah,5,26,"He's gonna raise a flag for all the nations, like, from a super far away place. And he's gonna make this sound, like, hissing, to get their attention all the way from the ends of the earth. And check it out, they'll come, like, really fast, like zooming in no time!"
Isaiah,5,27,"They won't get tired or stumble; no one will be caught napping or snoozing; their belts won't loosen, and their shoe laces won't break."
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows be sharp AF, bows all flexed, horses' hoofs be solid like flint, and their wheels be spinning like a freakin' whirlwind:"
Isaiah,5,29,"They gonna roar like a boss lion, just like the young lions do. And trust me, they gonna make some noise, snatchin' up their prey without breakin' a sweat, and nobody gonna be able to save that prey from 'em."
Isaiah,5,30,"And on that day, they will totally go off on them, making noise like the biggest waves in the ocean: and if someone checks out the land, it's all gloomy and sad, with the sky looking super dark. It's like when things are supposed to be bright, they'll actually be dark and messed up."
Isaiah,6,1,"So, like, in the year that King Uzziah passed away, I had this insane vision of the Lord, chillin' on a seriously majestic throne, all high up, and his robe was totally taking over the entire temple. {his...: or, the skirts thereof}"
Isaiah,6,2,"Above it there were these super cool angelic creatures called seraphims: they each had six wings - two to cover their faces, two to cover their feet, and two for some epic flying action!"
Isaiah,6,3,"And one person shouted to another, shouting, Godd is super holy, like, super, super holy! The Lord of all the armies is so awesome, and the whole earth is like, totally filled with His glory! It's epic!'"
Isaiah,6,4,"And, like, suddenly the door was shaking because of the dude's loud voice, and the whole place was totally filled with smoke. {door: BTW, it means thresholds in Hebrew}"
Isaiah,6,5,"So I was like, OMG! I'm so screwed! I mean, seriously, I've got like, totally impure language and I'm surrounded by people with the same issue. It's like, messy. 'Cause, ya know, I've actually seen the big boss, the Almighty King, the LORD of hosts. It's like, Mind-blown!"
Isaiah,6,6,"So, this angel dude flew over to me and, get this, he had a hot, burning coal in his hand that he grabbed from the altar using some tongs. Yeah, he was holding it, wild, right?"
Isaiah,6,7,"He put {it} on my mouth and said, Like, this has touched your lips; and your wrongdoing is totally wiped out, and your sin is cleansed. {laid...: In the Hebrew dialect, it means to cause it to touch}"
Isaiah,6,8,"So, I was, like, totally hearing the voice of the Lord, who was all like, 'Who should I send out on a mission for us?' And then I was like, 'Yo, I'm right here, send me!'"
Isaiah,6,9,"And he was like, 'Yo, go tell these people. Listen up, but like, you ain't gonna understand. Look, but you won't really see anything.'"
Isaiah,6,10,"Let their hearts be totally focused on unimportant things, let their ears be tuned out, and let their eyes be closed tight; so they won't have a clue about what's really going on, won't listen to the truth, won't feel anything deep inside, and won't change their ways or be made whole."
Isaiah,6,11,"I was like, 'Yo, Lord, when is this gonna end?' And he was straight up like, 'It's gonna keep going until the cities are empty, houses are abandoned, and the land is completely deserted, like, for real'."
Isaiah,6,12,"And God has like totally yeeted people far away, and there's, like, a major abandonment right in the middle of the land."
Isaiah,6,13,"But still there will be a remnant, a fraction of the whole, and they will come back and find nourishment. Like a resilient tree, their vitality will remain even when they shed their leaves. So, the sacred and chosen ones will be the foundation of restoration and growth."
Isaiah,7,1,"So, back in the day when Ahaz was ruling Judah (he's the son of Jotham, who's the son of Uzziah), there were these two kings, Rezin from Syria and Pekah (Remaliah's son) from Israel. They joined forces and tried to attack Jerusalem, but guess what? They totally failed, couldn't overpower Jerusalem at all."
Isaiah,7,2,"So word got out to the fam of David that Syria and Ephraim teamed up. And it shook them to the core, like trees swaying in the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"So the LORD told Isaiah, like, go and find Ahaz, you and your son Shearjashub. Meet them at the end of this spot by the fancy pool, like, on the road near the laundry place, ya know? Shearjashub means, like, something about a small group coming back. Oh, and it's on the highway, which is like a big road or causeway or whatever."
Isaiah,7,4,"Yo, listen up and chill out, don't stress, don't let your heart be weak because of these two hot-headed dudes who think they're all that, with Rezin from Syria and that Remaliah's son. Don't be scared of their anger and their smoke, man."
Isaiah,7,5,"So like, Syria, Ephraim, and Remaliah's son totally plotted against you, talking trash like:"
Isaiah,7,6,"Yo, let's go against Judah and mess with them, causing chaos and appointing our own king, Tabeal's son, right in the middle, ya know? Let's wake things up a bit."
Isaiah,7,7,"God was like, 'Nah, that ain't happening. It's not gonna go down, fam.'"
Isaiah,7,8,"So like, Syria's main spot is Damascus, ya know, and the leader of Damascus is this dude called Rezin. And guess what? In like 65 years, Ephraim is gonna get crushed and won't even be considered a people anymore. Like, they'll be totally wiped out, man. No more Ephraim, nope."
Isaiah,7,9,"Ephraim is like the boss of Samaria, and Samaria is led by Remaliah's son. If you dudes don't have faith, you won't find success. If you're not believing, it's because you lack stability, yo."
Isaiah,7,10,"Then the LORD hit up Ahaz again, like, 'Yo, listen up, Ahaz!'"
Isaiah,7,11,"Yo, ask for a sign from the LORD your God. Like, ask for something totally epic, either from deep down in the darkest depths or from way up in the sky. It's your call, man!"
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz was like, nah, I ain't gonna ask for anything, and I definitely ain't gonna test the LORD."
Isaiah,7,13,"And he was like, yo, listen up, fam of David; it's not cool for you to exhaust people, but you're really gonna exhaust my God too?"
Isaiah,7,14,"Yo, God Himself gonna drop a major clue for ya: Check it, a girl who's never been with a dude is gonna get pregnant and have a son, and she's gonna name him Immanuel. (And yeah, it's all on her to make that call, no pressure or anything)"
Isaiah,7,15,He'll feast on some butter and honey to learn how to reject the bad vibes and make good choices.
Isaiah,7,16,"Yo, before a kid even knows what's up with rejecting the bad and picking the good, the land that you totally hate is gonna be abandoned by both of its rulers."
Isaiah,7,17,"Yo, the LORD is gonna unleash some crazy stuff on you, your squad, and your fam. It's gonna be like nothing you've ever seen before, since the day Ephraim broke off from Judah. Brace yourselves, 'cause even the king of Assyria is gonna be in the mix."
Isaiah,7,18,"And like, on that day, God will totally summon all the flies from Egypt and all the bees from Assyria. It's gonna be wild!"
Isaiah,7,19,"And they'll come and chill in the empty valleys, and in the rock hideouts, and on all the thorny bushes and dope trees."
Isaiah,7,20,"On that same day, the Lord will use a rented electric trimmer to shave the head and feet hair of those who live across the river, under the rule of the Assyrian king. The beard will also be completely shaved off."
Isaiah,7,21,"And, like, on that day, a dude will totally take care of a little cow and two sheep, you know?"
Isaiah,7,22,"And like, there's gonna be, like, so much milk that they'll give, and he'll totally eat butter. Like, everybody who's left in the land is gonna be snackin' on butter and honey. It's gonna be poppin', yo!"
Isaiah,7,23,"And in that day, like, everywhere that used to have, like, a thousand vineyards that were worth a thousand silver coins will just end up all filled with annoying prickly stuff like briers and thorns."
Isaiah,7,24,"People will come armed with arrows and bows, because the entire land will be overrun with thorny obstacles."
Isaiah,7,25,"And if you dig up the hills with a mattock, you won't have to worry about pesky weeds and prickly thorns popping up there. It'll be perfect for the oxen to roam around and the smaller animals to trot on."
Isaiah,8,1,"Yo, the LORD told me, grab a fat scroll and write about Mahershalalhashbaz with a regular pen. FYI, Mahershalalhashbaz means he's quick to snatch up the loot."
Isaiah,8,2,"So, like, I got these super reliable peeps to back me up, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, Jeberechiah's kid."
Isaiah,8,3,"So I slid into the DMs of the prophetess, and she got preggers and gave birth to a son. Then the LORD said to me, 'Yo, name the kid Mahershalalhashbaz.'"
Isaiah,8,4,"Imagine this, before the child even learns to say 'Mom' and 'Dad,' the king of Assyria will come and snatch all the fancy stuff from Damascus and Samaria. Yeah, the king will totally raid their riches and spoil their treasures. It's gonna happen, no doubt about it!"
Isaiah,8,5,"OMG, God like totally talked to me again, and this is what He said,"
Isaiah,8,6,"Because these people did not appreciate the calm waters of Shiloah, and instead enjoyed the company of Rezin and the son of Remaliah;"

Isaiah,26,10,"Even if you give the wicked mad love, they still won't learn to do right. They'll keep doing shady stuff in a righteous place and straight up ignore how awesome the LORD is."
Isaiah,26,11,"Yo, God, when you flex, they won't even notice, but then they gonna see and feel mad embarrassed 'cause they were hating on your people. And those haters gonna get burned up by the fire of your enemies. No cap!"

Isaiah,26,18,"We've been expecting, we've been struggling, but it feels like we've given birth to nothing but air. We haven't made any difference in this world, and neither have the people around us."
Isaiah,26,19,"Your friends who have passed away will come back to life, and even I will rise again. So wake up and celebrate, all of you who are stuck in the boring routine of everyday life. Just like the morning dew refreshes the grass, the earth will give back the souls of the departed ones."
Isaiah,26,20,"Yo, listen up fam! It's time to retreat to your private space, lock them doors real tight. Just chill there for a hot minute, till all the bad vibes blow over."
Isaiah,26,21,"Yo, check it out! The LORD is coming out of His crib to straight up wreck the people of Earth because of all their wrongdoings. The earth's gonna spill the blood of those who got snuffed, and it won't be able to hide the dead bodies no more. (BTW, bloodd' in Hebrew means 'bloods', just so you know)"
Isaiah,27,1,"On that day, God will use His lit and powerful sword to straight up own Leviathan, the super scary and twisty serpent. He's gonna straight up slay the dragon in the ocean. No cap!"
Isaiah,27,2,"On that day, jam out to her, She's like a lit vineyard serving up that fire red wine."

Isaiah,27,6,"He's gonna make Jacob's descendants totally flourish: Israel will bloom and thrive, and spread its fruitful vibes all over the world."
Isaiah,27,7,Did he hit him back like how he hit those who hit him? Or is he killed like how those who were killed by him were killed?
Isaiah,27,8,"When stuff starts happening, you'll be all like, 'Nah, hold up, let's discuss this.' God keeps his strong wind under control during the toughest times."
Isaiah,27,9,"So basically, here's how Jacob can get rid of his wrongdoing: he needs to smash up all the stones on the altar, turning them into powder like crushed chalk. Then, all those statues and idols they're into won't stand a chance."
Isaiah,27,10,"But like, the city that used to be all strong and stuff is gonna be totally empty and abandoned, just like a wasteland. Like, cows will be chillin' there and napping, munching on the tree branches and all."
Isaiah,27,11,"When the branches start drying up, they'll be snapped off. And here come the ladies, ready to set them ablaze. ‘Cause, like, this group of people has zero understanding. So, the one who created them won't be showing them any kindness, and the one who formed them won't be merciful."
Isaiah,27,12,"And like, on that day, the LORD is gonna clear out a path all the way from the river to Egypt, and you, like, the children of Israel, will be like brought together one by one."
Isaiah,27,13,"Dude, when that day comes, a major trumpet is gonna be blasted. And you know what? Those peeps who were about to totally crash and burn in Assyria and the rejects in Egypt, they're all gonna show up and worship the LORD on the epic holy mountain in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,1,"Uh-oh, trouble ahead for the prideful and party-loving peeps of Ephraim! Their stunning looks are just like a flower that's losing its charm, rocking those valleys where wine has got 'em feeling totally wasted! (And by wasted, I mean broken, y'know?)"
Isaiah,28,2,"Yo, listen up! The Lord has got some serious power. It's like a crazy hailstorm, a destructive storm, or a massive flood that's gonna bring everything down with a single hand swipe."
Isaiah,28,3,"Those arrogant show-offs from Ephraim, who can't seem to stay sober, are about to get trampled on and humbled by everyone around them."
Isaiah,28,4,"Yo, that stunning beauty on the head of the thicc valley? It's like a flower that starts fading real quick, or a fruit that ripens way too fast before summer even hits. People peep it, and before they know it, it's in their hand and down the hatch it goes. Like, they straight up swallow it without even thinking."
Isaiah,28,5,"On that day the LORD of hosts will be like a lit crown and a stunning accessory, making his people even more awesome."
Isaiah,28,6,"And giving the power of critical thinking to those who make decisions, and providing strength to those who conquer challenges and achieve victory."
Isaiah,28,7,"But, like, even they have messed up coz of alcohol, and like, got totally lost coz of getting wasted; the religious leader and the prophet also got messed up coz of alcohol, they got totally consumed by it, they lost their direction coz of alcohol; they mess up their visions, they make mistakes in their decisions."
Isaiah,28,8,"Like, all the tables are totally covered in puke and gross stuff, so there isn't a single clean spot in sight."
Isaiah,28,9,"Who's he gonna drop some knowledge on? And who's gonna get the teachings? People who are done with the basic stuff, ready for the next level. You feel me?"
Isaiah,28,10,"It's like a step-by-step process, where one instruction builds upon another. It's all about taking it one step at a time, gradually and consistently. Knowledge is gained bit by bit, here and there."
Isaiah,28,11,"He's gonna communicate with these people using different speech patterns and languages. Like, he's gonna switch it up and speak in a way they might not expect."
Isaiah,28,12,"And he was like, 'Yo, listen up! This is the chill zone where y'all can find rest and relaxation, like a total vibe. But guess what? They straight up ignored it, didn't want to hear it.'"
Isaiah,28,13,"But the LORD's message to them was like getting instructions repeatedly, like step by step, step by step; one small part at a time, bit by bit. It was meant to guide them, but instead they stumbled, got hurt, got trapped, and got caught."
Isaiah,28,14,"Listen up, guys! The LORD has a message for all you haters who think you're running the show in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,15,"Yo, you think you can make a deal with death and be cool with hell? You really believe that when chaos hits, it won't touch you? 'Cause you've been relying on lies and hiding behind fake stuff?"
Isaiah,28,16,"So, like, listen up, okay? The Lord GOD is saying that check this out, in Zion, right? He's gonna set up this solid foundation, like a legit stone that's been tested and proven, you know? It's gonna be this super valuable cornerstone, like the real deal, making it a totally reliable foundation. And get this, those who believe in it won't be rushing or stressing out, ya feel me?"
Isaiah,28,17,I'm totally gonna bring justice and righteousness will be on point. Lies won't stand a chance because the hail gonna wipe 'em out and the waters gonna flood their hiding spot.
Isaiah,28,18,"And your deal with death will be cancelled, and your agreement with hell won't hold up; when the huge disaster comes, you will be totally crushed by it. {totally crushed...: Hebrew a stomping down on it}"
Isaiah,28,19,"Once it's out, it's gonna catch up to you, like every single day, morning and night. And let me tell you, trying to figure it out is just gonna drive you crazy."
Isaiah,28,20,"Like, the bed is, like, too small for a proper stretch, and the blanket is, like, not wide enough to fully wrap yourself up."
Isaiah,28,21,"The Lord's gonna go all out, like at Mount Perazim and the valley of Gibeon. He's gonna be fired up to do his thing, his unexplainable work, and carry out his mind-blowing plan."
Isaiah,28,22,"So like, don't be all mocking and stuff, or you'll end up in a tight spot, 'cause I've heard from the Lord GOD Almighty that there's gonna be some serious trouble for the whole earth."
Isaiah,28,23,"Yo, listen up and tune into my vibe; pay attention and hear my words."
Isaiah,28,24,Does the plow guy plow non-stop just to plant seeds? Does he keep digging and breaking up the chunks of dirt on his field?
Isaiah,28,25,"When he's done leveling the ground, doesn't he spread out the seeds, like fitches and cummin? And then he plants the best wheat and barley in the right spots, along with some rie or spelt. It's all about finding the perfect place for each crop."
Isaiah,28,26,Because his God guides him to make wise choices and teaches him. He helps him understand things the way his God wants him to.
Isaiah,28,27,"You don't use machines to separate the fitches from their stalks, and you don't roll a cartwheel over the cummin. Instead, you beat the fitches with a staff and the cummin with a rod."
Isaiah,28,28,"The bread {corn} has been crushed, because nobody's bothering to thresh it or break {it with} the wheel of a cart, or crush it {with} horsemen."
Isaiah,28,29,"This is straight from the Almighty, who's incredible at giving advice and absolutely amazing at getting things done."
Isaiah,29,1,"Oh no, Ariel, the city where David lived! Keep on celebrating year after year, offering sacrifices. Ariel, the mighty lion of God! In this city, let sacrifices be made, heads shall be cut off!"
Isaiah,29,2,"But listen up, Ariel's gonna be in some real deep trouble and things are gonna get super intense and sad. It's gonna feel like a total mess to me, just like how Ariel is."
Isaiah,29,3,"I'm gonna set up camp all around you, then I'll totally siege you with a sickly massive army, and I'll build some dope forts to trap you in."
Isaiah,29,4,"And you will be humbled, and you will speak from the ground, and your words will be quiet like a whisper, and your voice will sound mysterious, as if coming from a spirit, from the ground, and your words will softly emerge from the dust."
Isaiah,29,5,"And all those random people you don't know will be totally insignificant, like tiny specks of dust. Even those intimidating bullies will be as worthless as dry grass blowing away in the wind. And it's gonna happen out of nowhere, totally unexpected."
Isaiah,29,6,"Get ready, fam, 'cause the LORD of hosts is about to drop some serious thunder, earthquakes, and mad noise. It's gonna be like a crazy storm with intense tempest and fire that devours everything. You better brace yourselves!"
Isaiah,29,7,"And all the nations that come against Ariel, those who battle against her and her defenses, causing her distress, will be like a dream from a virtual reality game."
Isaiah,29,8,"Imagine this, it's like when a hungry person dreams of eating a delicious meal, but wakes up feeling unsatisfied. Or when a thirsty person dreams of quenching their thirst, but wakes up feeling weak and still craving. That's how it will be for all the nations who oppose mount Zion."
Isaiah,29,9,"Yo, hold up and be amazed; shout out, scream out: they're messed up, but not from sippin' wine; they're stumbling, but not 'cause of some strong booze. {take your pleasure, and riot: or have a good time and party}"
Isaiah,29,10,"Yo, the Lord straight up made you fall into a deep sleep and closed your eyes. Like, He covered the prophets, rulers, and seers, depriving them of their visions. (Heads up: 'rulers' in Hebrew means 'heads')."
Isaiah,29,11,"So basically, the whole vision thing is like a book that's totally sealed up. People give it to someone who's, like, super smart and say, 'Yo, read this for us, please!' But the person's like, 'Nah, can't do it, it's sealed up tight.'"
Isaiah,29,12,"So, they give the book to someone who's not really into books, and they're like, 'Um, can you read this please?' And the person's like, 'Nah, I'm not really into reading, sorry.'"
Isaiah,29,13,"So God's like, 'Yo, these peeps be talkin' 'bout me and showin' me respect, but their hearts ain't even close to me. And they only fear me 'cause other people tell 'em to'"
Isaiah,29,14,"Yo, check this out - I'm about to do something seriously mind-blowing with these peeps. It's gonna be straight up incredible, something they can't even wrap their heads around. All the big brain geniuses out there? Yeah, their wisdom won't mean squat, and those so-called smart cookies won't have a clue what's going on."
Isaiah,29,15,"Uh-oh to those who tryin' to keep their secrets from the big man upstairs, doin' their shady business in the shadows, actin' like nobody's watchin'. Like, come on, who they think they foolin'? He knows wassup!"
Isaiah,29,16,"Like, seriously, if you're being all rebellious and totally going against the flow, it's like saying the potter's clay isn't important. Should the stuff being made say to the maker, 'Yo, you didn't make me'? Or should the thing that's crafted say to the crafter, 'Dude, you have no clue what you're doing'?"
Isaiah,29,17,"Like, wait a sec, guys! Before you know it, Lebanon's gonna totally transform into this mega fertile field. And get this, that lush, fruitful field? It'll be like a legit forest, all impressive and stuff!"
Isaiah,29,18,"And on that day, the ones who can't hear will finally catch the words from the book, and even the blind will see through the darkness and obscurity."
Isaiah,29,19,"Even the humble ones will level up their happiness in the LORD, and those who are struggling among people will totally vibe with the Holy One of Israel. #upgrade #blessed"
Isaiah,29,20,"Yo, the big bad dude is total flopped, and the hater is straight up cancelled, and all those creepin' to do dirty deeds are gonna get booted:"
Isaiah,29,21,"They try to cancel you for saying something wrong, and they trap you if you call out injustice, and they disregard fairness for something insignificant."
Isaiah,29,22,"So like, the LORD says this, right, the one who saved Abraham and stuff, about Jacob's fam. Jacob won't feel embarrassed or get all pale-faced anymore."
Isaiah,29,23,"But when he sees his kids, the masterpiece of my creation, right there with him, they'll honor my name, and honor the Holy One of Jacob, and show respect for the God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,"Those who were confused at first will gain clarity, and those who complained will acquire knowledge and wisdom. {gain clarity...: Hebrew word for understanding}"
Isaiah,30,1,"Man, it's gonna be rough for those rebellious kids, says the LORD. They out here seeking advice from everyone but me, going for all the wrong things instead of my spirit. It's like they tryna stack up sins on top of each other."
Isaiah,30,2,"Dude, seriously? They're totally heading to Egypt without even checking with me first. Thinking they can find power and security from Pharaoh, trusting in Egypt's help like it's some kind of shade!"
Isaiah,30,3,"So, basically, putting all your hope in Pharaoh's power will only make you look dumb, and relying on Egypt for protection will just leave you feeling lost and bewildered."
Isaiah,30,4,"Because his squad was chilling in Zoan, and his ambassadors rolled up to Hanes."
Isaiah,30,5,"They were all embarrassed by those people who couldn't bring them any benefit or help, but instead were a source of shame and disrespect."
Isaiah,30,6,"The struggle of the savage creatures down south: they're heading to a land full of chaos and misery. You've got the fierce youthful and aged lion, the sneaky viper, and the fiery flying serpent. They'll be hauling their wealth on the backs of young donkeys and loading up camels with their precious treasures, but it's all for nothing because the people they're delivering to won't benefit from any of it."
Isaiah,30,7,"The Egyptians won't be much help, it's gonna be pointless. So, I've been saying this all along, they're good at just sitting around doing nothing."
Isaiah,30,8,"Okay, listen up! Take out your phone and type it out on a digital note, and make sure to save it in a cloud document. This message has major future vibes and it's gonna be relevant forever and ever. #Timeless"
Isaiah,30,9,"These peeps be straight-up rebellious, like, they don't listen to the Lord's laws at all. They be some lying kiddos, always pulling shady moves."
Isaiah,30,10,"They're like, telling the seers not to see, and the prophets not to speak the truth, but instead they want them to say what they want to hear, and spread lies and deceit."
Isaiah,30,11,"Move aside, step away from the road, stop the Holy One of Israel from being in our presence."
Isaiah,30,12,"So listen up, guys! The big man upstairs, the Holy One of Israel, has something to say. You keep dissin' His word, relying on shady stuff like bullying and acting all twisted. And you think that's cool? Nah, it ain't."
Isaiah,30,13,"So, like, this wrongdoing is gonna be, like, a total disaster waiting to happen. It's gonna be this massive wall that's about to collapse, like, unexpectedly and all at once."
Isaiah,30,14,And he's gonna smash it like when a potter's vessel shatters into pieces; he ain't gonna hold back. There won't even be a single fragment left to use as fuel for fire or scoop up water from a well. (the potter's...: Translation in Hebrew means the potter's clay jar)
Isaiah,30,15,"The Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, says: If you chill out and take a break, you'll find salvation; your strength lies in being calm and confident. But you peeps just ain't into it."
Isaiah,30,16,"But you were like, nah; we'll bounce on those horses, so you'll end up bouncing too. And we'll cruise on the fast ones; so those chasing you will speed up too."
Isaiah,30,17,"When one person calls you out, a thousand others will run away; when five people criticize you, you'll start running as well. You'll keep running until you're left standing alone like a cool landmark on the highest peak or a trendy flag flying on a hill. (Note: The 'cool landmark' can be a bare tree or a mast on a ship.)"
Isaiah,30,18,"So, like, God is totally patient and waiting for you, so He can be all kinds of loving and kind. And He's gonna lift Himself up and show mercy to you. 'Cause, you know, God is all about fairness and making good judgments. Those who wait for Him are totally blessed, no doubt!"
Isaiah,30,19,"So, like, the peeps will totally live in Zion, which is Jerusalem, you know? And hey, no need to shed any more tears because the Big Guy upstairs, he's gonna be mad cool when he hears your cry. Seriously, he's gonna listen up and give you an answer, no doubt."
Isaiah,30,20,"But, like, even if things get tough and you're going through a hard time, your mentors won't bail on you. You'll still have access to them, no hidden corners here. In fact, you'll actually see them with your own eyes. Just a heads up, 'affliction' could mean 'oppression' too."
Isaiah,30,21,"And you'll totally hear a voice behind you, like saying, 'Dude, this is the way, just go for it!' when you're deciding to go right or left."
Isaiah,30,22,"You gotta totally disrespect those silver statues you idolize and those golden figures you worship. Just toss 'em aside like a used pad and be like, 'Get outta here!'"
Isaiah,30,23,"And then he'll make it rain on your crops so you can plant them in the ground and get lots of yummy food. The earth will be super fertile, producing a ton of food for everyone. Your animals will have plenty to eat in spacious pastures!"
Isaiah,30,24,"Of course, the oxen and the young donkeys that work the field should munch on top-notch food that's been sifted and chosen carefully. (Clean, also known as savory, means it's packed with flavor and totally leavened.)"
Isaiah,30,25,"And you'll see mad waterfalls and streams everywhere, flowing down from the tallest mountains and highest hills on the day of major chaos, when the towers come crashing down."
Isaiah,30,26,"Yo, check it. When the Lord fixes up His people and heals their wounds, the moon's light will be as bright as the sun, and the sun's light will be seven times stronger, like it's seven days rolled into one."
Isaiah,30,27,"Yo, pay attention! The LORD's name is coming from far away, and He's super mad, like burning with anger. The weight of His anger is heavy, like he's got a lot to say. His words are filled with outrage, and His speech is like a fierce fire. It's no joke, His anger is intense."
Isaiah,30,28,"And his breath be like a viral wave, spreading all the way up to the neck, will sort out the nations with a filter of foolishness. Plus, a restraint will be on the people like a bridle, leading them astray."
Isaiah,30,29,"You'll vibe to a lit track, like when a lit spiritual celebration happens at night; and feel mad joy, like when someone rolls up with a playlist while hiking up the Lord's mountain, to the mighty One of Israel. (mighty...: Heb. Rock)"
Isaiah,30,30,"And God will make sure everyone hears his awesome voice, and will display his powerful strength by showing them how angry he is, with a blazing fire that devours everything in its path, along with chaos, storms, and hailstones."
Isaiah,30,31,"Because when the LORD starts speaking, that's when the Assyrians are going to get wrecked for all the damage they caused."
Isaiah,30,32,"And wherever the cool staff goes, like God places it on the ground, it's gonna be a lit party with drums and guitars. And when it's time to battle and shake things up, God's gonna fight with it."
Isaiah,30,33,"Tophet has been around forever, it's totally set up for the king. He went all out with it, making it super deep and wide. There's this massive bonfire there, with tons of firewood. And get this, the breath of the LORD is like a fiery stream of sulfur, making that fire blaze even hotter. It's been like this since way back in the day, like yesterday or something."
Isaiah,31,1,"Oh no, those who rely on Egypt for help and put their trust in horses and chariots, thinking they have a strong army with many horsemen! But they don't seek the Holy One of Israel, nor do they seek the LORD!"
Isaiah,31,2,"But, like, he's totally smart and knows when to bring the heat. Once he says it, he's not gonna back down. He's gonna come at the wicked guys and all those who do bad stuff. No take-backsies, yo!"
Isaiah,31,3,"So, like, those Egyptians, they're just regular dudes, not gods or anything. And their horses? Yeah, they're just flesh, not all supernatural or whatever. But when the LORD (you know, God) stretches out His hand, all those people who try to help and those they're trying to help? They'll all fall down, like, together. Total fail, dude."
Isaiah,31,4,"So the LORD hit me up, and He's like, yo, picture this: It's like a lion and its cub, going all fierce and roaring while they're chowing down on some delicious prey. And even if a bunch of shepherds jump in and start making noise, the lion ain't gonna be scared or back down. That's exactly how the LORD of all the armies is gonna come down and fight for Mount Zion and its hills. No one's gonna make Him flinch or bring Him down with all their noise and commotion."
Isaiah,31,5,"Just like birds soaring through the sky, the LORD of all will totally have Jerusalem's back - like, totally defending and delivering it, and even like, passing over it to keep it safe and sound."
Isaiah,31,6,"Yo, Israelites, gotta come back to the one y'all deeply betrayed."
Isaiah,31,7,"On that day, everybody will ditch their silver and gold idols that they made themselves, which are a total sin. Yeah, even those golden idols they worshiped so much. Like, seriously, they're a big deal in the Hebrew language."
Isaiah,31,8,"And so, the Assyrian will be defeated, not by a powerful warrior's sword, but by a sword wielded by an unexpected hero. It will consume him completely, catching him by surprise. He will try to escape, but even his young soldiers will be overwhelmed with fear."
Isaiah,31,9,"And, like, he's gonna retreat to his safe space 'cause he's totally scared, and his squad will be freaking out when they see the sign, says the LORD. 'Cause, you know, God's fiery power is in Zion, and his epic furnace is in Jerusalem. Like, legit, his foundation will crumble from fear."
Isaiah,32,1,"Yo, check it out, there's gonna be a righteous king in charge, and wise AF rulers gonna be making smart decisions."
Isaiah,32,2,"Dude, like picture this - there's a guy who's like your ultimate shelter when things get wild. He's your safe spot from the stormy chaos around you, just like a refreshing river in the middle of a parched desert. And he's as reassuring as the shade of a massive rock on a scorching hot day. That's heavy, man!"
Isaiah,32,3,"And those who have good vision won't need glasses, and those who have good hearing will listen carefully."
Isaiah,32,4,Even impulsive people can gain wisdom and those with speech difficulties can learn to express themselves confidently.
Isaiah,32,5,"The nasty person won't be called cool anymore, and the rude one won't be considered generous."
Isaiah,32,6,"The wicked dude will talk trash and be all about doing bad stuff, pretending to be cool while spreading lies about the LORD, making the hungry feel empty inside and messing with the thirsty's drink."
Isaiah,32,7,"The stuff that jerks use is wicked: they come up with messed up plans to ruin the lives of the less fortunate, using lies and deceit, even when the oppressed are standing up for themselves. (or, they speak against the poor in unfair judgments)"
Isaiah,32,8,"But the open-minded person comes up with innovative ideas, and their success is built on these ideas."
Isaiah,32,9,"Yo, all you chicas chilling in comfort, listen up! Pay attention to what I gotta say."
Isaiah,32,10,"Yo, you careless ladies are gonna be straight up stressed for a hot minute, 'cause the wine-making season is gonna be a major flop and there won't be any harvest to gather. Just saying."
Isaiah,32,11,"Yo, all you chill girls out there, better start shaking with fear. Time to get worried, all you carefree ladies. Strip down, get totally vulnerable, and wrap yourselves in sackcloth around your waist."
Isaiah,32,12,"They'll be so sad about the cool views, the lit hangout spots, the fruitful vines. 💔"
Isaiah,32,13,"Thorns and sharp plants will cover the land where my people live, even the happy city and its joyful homes."
Isaiah,32,14,"Yo, listen up! Those fancy palaces will be totally abandoned. The bustling city will be deserted, no one in sight. The forts and towers? They'll just become hangout spots for wild donkeys, a chill spot for flocks of sheep to munch on some grass. Yeah, those forts... or should I say, clifts and watchtowers?"
Isaiah,32,15,"Until the vibes hit us from above, and the desolate place becomes lit and popping, and the popping place turns into a straight-up jungle."
Isaiah,32,16,"Yo, so like, when it goes down in the wilderness, you know there's gonna be some serious judgment happening. And righteousness? Yeah, that vibe's gonna be staying strong in the fruitful field, no doubt."
Isaiah,32,17,Doing what's right leads to peace; righteousness brings calm and confidence that lasts forever.
Isaiah,32,18,"And my peeps gonna live in a chill crib, with legit homes, and in totally quiet places to kick back and relax;"

Isaiah,32,20,"You guys are totally blessed if you're sowing seeds all over the place, makin' sure those oxen and donkeys are doing their thing on the farm life."
Isaiah,33,1,"Oh, big oof to you, the one who goes around spoiling others without getting spoiled yourself, and being all sneaky and deceitful when nobody does the same to you! Just so you know, when you eventually stop your spoiling game, you’ll end up getting spoiled, and when you stop being all sneaky, they’ll start being sneaky right back at you."
Isaiah,33,2,"Yo, God, please show us some love; we've been patient and waiting for you. Be our strength and salvation, especially when things get tough."
Isaiah,33,3,"When the commotion started, everyone dipped in a flash; when you rose up, the nations got scattered."
Isaiah,33,4,And your loot will be snatched up just like how caterpillars gather: he will move swiftly like locusts rushing upon them.
Isaiah,33,5,"OMG, God is like, the absolute best! He's totally up there, living his best life. And let me tell you, he's brought so much fairness and goodness to Zion, it's lit!"
Isaiah,33,6,"And like, wisdom and knowledge, they'll be like the foundation of your life, ya know? They're like the ultimate power that saves you. And, like, showing mad respect and awe for the LORD, it's like His ultimate treasure, you feel me?"
Isaiah,33,7,"Yo, check it out, their brave ones gonna be crying out loud, and even the peace ambassadors gonna be sobbing hard. 🙅‍♂️💔"
Isaiah,33,8,"The roads are messed up, no one's traveling anymore: they've ditched the promises, they don't care about the cities, they've shown no respect to anyone."
Isaiah,33,9,The earth is so sad and tired: Lebanon is embarrassed and cut down. Sharon looks like a complete wasteland; even Bashan and Carmel are shaking off their fruits. (withered away)
Isaiah,33,10,"Yo, it's go time, says the LORD. I'm about to level up and move up in the ranks."
Isaiah,33,11,"Like, you're gonna make empty plans, and end up with useless results. Your hype and energy will just burn you up."
Isaiah,33,12,"And the gang gonna be lit up like some fire lime, they gonna get burned up like chopped thorns in the flames."
Isaiah,33,13,"Listen up, whether you're far away or nearby, I want you to know about all the awesome things I've done and recognize how powerful I am."
Isaiah,33,14,"Dang, the folks in Zion are straight-up scared! The hypocrites are totally caught off guard by all this fear. Like, who among us can handle that intense heat? Or live through those everlasting burns?"
Isaiah,33,15,"Someone who acts with integrity, speaks honestly, refuses to profit from deceit, refuses to accept bribes, avoids hearing about violence, and chooses not to witness evil;"
Isaiah,33,16,"He will live in the heights, protected by strong fortresses. He will be provided with food and never run out of water."
Isaiah,33,17,"You'll totally see the king looking all fabulous, checking out a really faraway land that's super awesome. Like, it's way beyond what you can normally see."
Isaiah,33,18,"Your heart will be filled with fear. Like, where did the scribe go? And what about the dude who was keeping track? And where's the guy who counted the towers? Was he legit srs about that?"
Isaiah,33,19,"You won't understand a bunch of people who speak differently than you, with a whole crazy language and weird accents that you can't even comprehend."
Isaiah,33,20,"Check out Zion, the lit city where we party hard. Your eyes gonna see Jerusalem as the ultimate chill spot, a spot that's always gonna be standing strong. Ain't nobody gonna mess with it, ain't no cords gonna snap."
Isaiah,33,21,"But yo, the awesome LORD gonna be a dope spot for us with mad rivers and streams, where no paddleboard or fancy yacht gonna roll through. It's gonna be hella spacious, ya feel?"
Isaiah,33,22,"The LORD is totally our judge, like he knows what's up. He's also our lawgiver, making the rules and stuff. Plus, he's our king, straight up ruling the game. And guess what, he's gonna save us. Just so you know, 'statutemaker' means he's the one who sets all the laws, just FYI."
Isaiah,33,23,"Dude, your gear is busted! They couldn't even fix the mast properly or unfurl the sail. So, the booty from a big raid gets split up among them, and even the weak ones get a share of the spoils."
Isaiah,33,24,"And the person living there won't say, 'I'm feeling sick.' The people who call that place home will have their sins forgiven."
Isaiah,34,1,"Listen up, everyone! Pay attention, people of all nations! Let the whole world and everything in it hear what I have to say. {all that...: Heb. the fulness thereof}"
Isaiah,34,2,"Yo, the LORD's mad at all the nations, and his anger is aimed at their armies too. He straight up wiped them out, handing them over for a massive beatdown."
Isaiah,34,3,"Their dead bodies will be thrown away, and their foul odor will rise from their corpses, causing the mountains to be drenched in their blood."
Isaiah,34,4,"And like, the whole crew up in the sky will totally disappear, and the skies will roll up like a scroll, and everyone up there will crash down like leaves falling off a vine or figs dropping from a fig tree."
Isaiah,34,5,"Yo, my sword gonna be swingin' up above, like heavenly vibes bro. Check it, it's gonna come down on Idumea and those peeps who got cursed by me. It's time for some major judgment!"
Isaiah,34,6,"OMG, bro, the LORD's sword is like, drenched in blood, like super filled with fat and stuff. It's all from lambs, goats, and the like, even the fatty parts of rams! The LORD is gonna have this epic sacrifice in Bozrah and like, a massive slaughter in the land of Idumea, you know!"
Isaiah,34,7,"And the unicorns, or you know, rhinocerots, are gonna roll up with them, along with the bullocks and the bulls. And their land is gonna be dripping with blood, like real soaked, and the dust is gonna be all thick and greasy with fatness. Uh, yeah, pretty intense stuff!"
Isaiah,34,8,"Yo, it's like the day when the Lord brings down the hammer and gets even for all the stuff going down in Zion."
Isaiah,34,9,"And the streams will be turned into some hardcore tar-ish stuff, and the dust will transform into scorching brimstone, and the land will be lit with blazing pitch."
Isaiah,34,10,"It's gonna stay lit day and night, with the smoke rising forever. Like, it's gonna be a total wasteland from one generation to the next, and like, no one's gonna be able to pass through it, like, forever and ever."
Isaiah,34,11,"Yo, the cormorant and the bittern are gonna take over that place, along with the owl and the raven living there. And then, it's gonna be totally messed up and empty, like seriously messed up, with nothing there but confusion and emptiness. (P.S. Cormorant is like a pelican, just FYI)"
Isaiah,34,12,"They'll try to summon all the cool kids to come rule the kingdom, but guess what? None of them will show up, and all of their so-called leaders will turn out to be a big fat zero."
Isaiah,34,13,"Like, her palaces will be totally infested with thorns, and her fortresses will have nettles and brambles all over. It'll become a place where dragons and owls hang out, you know? Yeah, it'll be like an epic hangout spot for owls... or ostriches, if you prefer the Hebrew version. #NatureGoneWild"
Isaiah,34,14,"The desert creatures will hang with the island creatures, and even the mythical creatures will call out to their homies. The night owl will chill there too, finding a cozy spot for itself."
Isaiah,34,15,"The big owl gonna find a chill spot and make her crib there, lay her eggs and keep 'em cozy, and all the homies gonna gather under her shade. And yo, the vultures gonna be there too, pairing up with their mates."
Isaiah,34,16,"Yo, like check out the book of the LORD, and read it, fam: ain't none of the things written in there gonna flake, and yo, nothing's missing its match, straight up. 'Cause I said it with my mouth, and my spirit brought it all together, no cap."
Isaiah,34,17,"And he's like, randomly assigned them their portions, and divided it up using some lines. They're gonna own it forever, like from one generation to the next, they'll be living there."
Isaiah,35,1,"The barren and lonely spots gonna be lit for them; like, the desert gonna be like 'yasss', blooming like a boss babe rose."
Isaiah,35,2,"It's gonna bloom like crazy, and its happiness will be off the charts: Lebanon, Carmel, and Sharon will be drooling over it, witnessing the amazingness of the LORD and our awesome God."
Isaiah,35,3,Help out those with weak hands and support those with wobbly knees.
Isaiah,35,4,"Tell those who are feeling anxious or scared to stay strong and not be afraid. Look, your God will arrive with justice, repaying those who have wronged you. He will come and rescue you."
Isaiah,35,5,"And like, check it fam, when this goes down, the blind squad gonna have their eyes opened wide open, and the deaf fam gonna have their ears straight up unstopped. It's gonna be lit!"
Isaiah,35,6,"Once that dude who couldn't even walk starts jumping like a cool deer, and the one who couldn't speak starts belting out some sick tunes. It's gonna be wild, yo! There'll be water gushing in the middle of nowhere and streams flowing through the dry desert."
Isaiah,35,7,"Yo, check it. The dry, cracked ground will straight up turn into a sick pool, and the thirsty land will have mad springs of water. Even in places where you'd find dragons hangin' out, there's gonna be chill grass, reeds, and rushes. No joke!"
Isaiah,35,8,"There's gonna be a dope road, like, a total vibe, and it's gonna be called The Holy Highway. Like, no filthy beings will be allowed on it, only the real ones who are about it. Even if they ain't the smartest, they won't mess up on that path. Like, for real, 'cause the man's gonna be right there with them."
Isaiah,35,9,There won't be any lions or hungry beasts roaming around there; they won't be found. But the ones who've been redeemed will walk freely there.
Isaiah,35,10,"And those who the LORD has saved will go back, and will come to Zion with lit songs and forever happiness on their heads: they will get hella joy and stoke, and all the sadness and sighing will totally GTFO."
Isaiah,36,1,"So, like, in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, decided to roll up on all the fortified cities of Judah and straight up captured them."
Isaiah,36,2,"So, like, the king of Assyria, he sends this dude called Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, right? And this dude shows up with a massive army. He goes and stands near the conduit of the upper pool, like by the road that leads to the fuller's field, you know?"
Isaiah,36,3,"So there were these guys named Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was in charge of the crib, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder. By the way, scribe here means like a secretary."
Isaiah,36,4,"So, like, Rabshakeh totally said to them, you know, go tell Hezekiah this: 'Listen up, man, the mighty king of Assyria has a question for you! What's up with all this trust you have going on? Like, what's your deal?'}"
Isaiah,36,5,"I mean, come on, do you really think those words of yours mean anything? I've got all the strategy and power I need for war. So, who do you think you can rely on to go against me like this?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Listen up, you're really relying on that weak Egyptian alliance? Dude, if you lean on that like a walking stick, it's gonna snap and stab you in the hand. Same goes for Pharaoh, he's a major letdown for anyone who puts their faith in him."
Isaiah,36,7,"But like, if you're trying to tell me, 'Yo, we trust in the LORD our God,' isn't it the same God that Hezekiah got rid of all his fancy worship places and altars? He was all like, 'Yo, peeps of Judah and Jerusalem, you gotta worship in front of this altar only.'"
Isaiah,36,8,"So like, hear me out. If you, like, get on board with my main man, the king of Assyria, I'll hook you up with two thousand horses. But hey, E-Z question: can you actually handle them and put riders on them? Just curious, bro. Oh, btw, by 'pledges' I mean those fancy things called 'hostages'. No biggie."
Isaiah,36,9,"So, like, how do you think you can impress some low-level dude when it comes to trusting Egypt for fancy rides and soldiers?"
Isaiah,36,10,"Wait, did I just roll up here without the Lord's command to wreck this place? The Lord straight up told me to go all in and wreck this land."
Isaiah,36,11,"So Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, 'Hey, could you like, talk to us in Syrian? We totally get it. Don't speak in Jewish in front of everyone watching.'"
Isaiah,36,12,"But Rabshakeh was like, did my boss really send me here to talk to your boss and you? Nah man, he sent me to the dudes on the wall over there, so they can eat their own crap and drink their own pee with you."
Isaiah,36,13,"So Rabshakeh, like, stood up and literally yelled in the language of the Jews, like, saying, 'Listen up, dudes! Pay attention to the words of the super awesome king, the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,36,14,"Listen up, fam! The king says, don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He won't be able to save you, no cap."
Isaiah,36,15,"Don't let Hezekiah fool you into putting your faith in the LORD, claiming that the LORD will totally save us and that this city won't fall into the hands of the Assyrian king."
Isaiah,36,16,"Don't listen to Hezekiah, cuz the king of Assyria is like, 'Hey, let's make a deal. Come out to me and we can share all the juicy vineyards, fig trees, and water from your own cistern. It's gonna be a total blessing, trust me.'"
Isaiah,36,17,"Until I slide through and teleport you to a lit land just like your own, a land filled with dope food and drinks, a land bursting with fresh bread and chill vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"Yo, watch out! Don't let Hezekiah fool you into thinking that the LORD will save us. Have any of those other gods from different nations actually rescued their lands from the king of Assyria? Doubt it!"
Isaiah,36,19,"Yo, where them gods of Hamath and Arphad at? And where them gods of Sepharvaim? They ain't done nothin' to save Samaria from me, fam!"
Isaiah,36,20,"Like, seriously, which one of these supposed gods actually saved their land? Like, why would the Lord save Jerusalem from me?"
Isaiah,36,21,"But they stayed quiet and didn't respond at all because the king's command was, like, 'Don't even bother answering him, dude'."
Isaiah,36,22,"So Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was in charge of the household, along with Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder, went to Hezekiah looking torn up and shared with him what Rabshakeh had said."
Isaiah,37,1,"So, like, when King Hezekiah found out about it, he was totally devastated and tore his clothes. He put on some sackcloth and went straight to the house of the LORD."
Isaiah,37,2,"So he picked Eliakim, who was in charge of everything, and Shebna the scribe, and the older priests who were wrapped in sackcloth, to go to Isaiah the prophet, Amoz's son."
Isaiah,37,3,"And they were like, yo Hezekiah, this day is straight up rough, full of drama, and disrespect, man. It's like labor pains but there's no energy to give birth. (the disrespect is real)"
Isaiah,37,4,"Maybe God will hear what Rabshakeh, who the king of Assyria sent to insult the Almighty, is saying. God may even respond to those words that He has heard. So, go ahead and pray for the remaining few who are still here."
Isaiah,37,5,"So, like, King Hezekiah's peeps showed up at Isaiah's place."
Isaiah,37,6,"And Isaiah was like, yo, tell your boss this message from the LORD: don't stress about the crap those servants of the Assyrian king been talking, dissing me and all."
Isaiah,37,7,"Yo, check it, I'm about to send a major wave his way, and he's gonna catch wind of some gossip and book it back to his turf. Then, I'll make sure he gets taken down by the sword in his own hood. {send...: or, put a spirit into him}"
Isaiah,37,8,So Rabshakeh went back and saw that the king of Assyria was fighting against Libnah because he heard that he had left Lachish.
Isaiah,37,9,"So like, word got around that Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, was planning to start a war against you. And when he caught wind of it, he quickly sent messengers to Hezekiah, sending him a message like,"
Isaiah,37,10,"Yo, here's how you talk to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, man. Don't let your God, the one you believe in, trick you into thinking that Jerusalem won't be taken over by the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,11,"Yo, listen up! You know how those Assyrian kings have been straight up wrecking every land they come across? So, like, do you really think you're gonna be spared from their wrath?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Do you really think the gods of other countries could save them? Like, hello, my ancestors totally wiped out places like Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and those peeps in Telassar. They were no match for our power, so why would they help others?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Yo, what happened to the kings of Hamath, Arphad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Can't find 'em anywhere, man!"
Isaiah,37,14,"So Hezekiah gets the letter from the messengers, and he reads it. Then he goes to the house of the LORD and shows it to Him."
Isaiah,37,15,"And Hezekiah like, totally prayed to the LORD, and he was all like,"
Isaiah,37,16,"Yo, God, the ultimate boss, the one true God of Israel, who's kickin' it with the cherubims, you're the only God who rules over all the kingdoms on earth. You're the one who created the heavens and the earth, like, legit."
Isaiah,37,17,"Yo, God, listen up and pay attention. Open your eyes and observe everything that Sennacherib is saying to insult you, the one true God."
Isaiah,37,18,"OMG, no lie, LORD, the kings of Assyria totally wrecked all the nations and their turf, ya know? #nations #lands"
Isaiah,37,19,"And they totally yeeted their fake gods into the fire because, like, hello, those things aren't even real. They were just some DIY projects made of wood and stone by humans. Obviously, they got wrecked because they were such a joke."
Isaiah,37,20,"Yo God, we need you to come through and save us from his grip. We're counting on you, 'cause when you save us, the whole earth will see that you're the one and only Lord."
Isaiah,37,21,"So, like, Isaiah, who's the son of Amoz, hit up Hezekiah saying, 'Yo, this is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'Since you're all about praying to me about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria...'"
Isaiah,37,22,Here's what God said about him: The cool girl from Zion totally dissed you and laughed at you. The popular girl from Jerusalem shook her head at you.
Isaiah,37,23,Who are you disrespecting and insulting? And who are you trying to sound all high and mighty towards? You're doing it against the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,37,24,"You've disrespected the Lord through your servants, bragging about how your mighty chariots brought you to conquer the tallest mountains and the lush forests of Lebanon. You claimed that you would cut down their majestic cedar and fir trees, and invade their borders, even their beautiful Carmel forest."
Isaiah,37,25,"I've excavated and quenched my thirst; I've even used my feet to evaporate all the rivers surrounding fortified areas. {besieged: or, fenced and closed}"
Isaiah,37,26,"Didn't you hear about this a while back? I totally did it. Like, way back in the day, I created it. And now, I made it happen: turning those protected cities into total ruins. Like, seriously, haven't you heard? I planned this ages ago, and now it's all going down. Cities that used to be so strong and secure are now just piles of rubble. Can you believe it?!"
Isaiah,37,27,"So basically, the people living there were weak and scared, totally freaking out. They were like grass that gets trampled on, just insignificant. It was like they were grass growing on rooftops, or crops that get ruined before they even have a chance to grow properly. They had no power to stand up against anything."
Isaiah,37,28,"But I know where you live, and when you leave, and when you come back, and how mad you are at me. {abode: or, sitting}"
Isaiah,37,29,"Since I've heard all the hate and chaos directed at me, I'm gonna shut you down by messing with your plans. Consider this like hooking your nose and putting a bridle on your mouth, and I'll make sure you go back the way you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"Yo, listen up, this is gonna be a dope sign for you: for this year, you gonna eat whatever grows naturally, and for the next year, you gonna munch on whatever comes from that. But wait, there's more! In the third year, you get to start planting and harvesting your own stuff, even growing some fresh vines for delicious fruit!"
Isaiah,37,31,And the small group that survives from the house of Judah will rebuild their foundations and flourish: {the surviving group...: which means the ones who manage to escape from the house of Judah will establish themselves and prosper}
Isaiah,37,32,"Like, from Jerusalem, only a small group will survive and make it out of mount Zion. It's gonna be absolutely rad, 'cause the LORD of hosts is super passionate about making it happen. Like, escape game level unlocked, you know? #Blessed"
Isaiah,37,33,"So, like, God is saying that the king of Assyria won't even step foot in this city, ya know? No arrows shot or shields raised, and definitely no making a siege ramp or anything."
Isaiah,37,34,"Just so you know, he'll leave the same way he came, and won't be making an appearance in this city, declares the LORD."
Isaiah,37,35,"Cause I got your back on protecting this city, both for my own sake and for my homeboy David's sake."
Isaiah,37,36,"Then this angel sent by God went to the Assyrian camp and wiped out a huge army of one hundred and eighty-five thousand soldiers. When the surviving soldiers woke up the next morning, they found the entire camp filled with dead bodies."
Isaiah,37,37,"And like, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, bounced and like, went back, and like, crashed at Nineveh."
Isaiah,37,38,"So, this guy was chilling and doing his worship thing in his god's house, you know, Nisroch. And out of nowhere, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer straight up attacked him with swords! They managed to escape to Armenia, leaving the poor guy behind. As a result, Esarhaddon, his son, took over the throne. Fun fact: Armenia is also referred to as Ararat in Hebrew!"
Isaiah,38,1,"Back in the day, Hezekiah was seriously sick, like almost dying. Then Isaiah, this prophet dude who's Amoz's son, rolled up to him and straight up said, 'Yo, this is what the LORD says: Get your life together, 'cause you're about to kick the bucket and not have any more chill.' (By the way, 'Get your life together' in Hebrew means 'Give charge concerning thy house', just so you know.)"
Isaiah,38,2,"So Hezekiah, like, turned his face to the wall and started praying to the LORD,"
Isaiah,38,3,"And Hezekiah was like, yo God, remember how I've been keeping it real and pure with you, doing all the good stuff you're into? So Hezekiah straight up started crying real hard."
Isaiah,38,4,"And God message Isaiah like,"
Isaiah,38,5,"Yo, go tell Hezekiah what the LORD, the God of David your father, says: I heard your prayer, I saw your tears. Check it out, I'm about to extend your life by fifteen years."
Isaiah,38,6,"And I got you fam! This city won't be crushed by the king of Assyria. I've got its back, no worries!"
Isaiah,38,7,And here's a heads-up from the LORD to prove that He's gonna make it happen just like He said;
Isaiah,38,8,"Yo, check it out, I'm gonna make the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz go back ten degrees. So the sun went back ten degrees, reversing the direction it was moving. {sundial: in Hebrew, it's like, the degrees that go with, or, follow the sun}"
Isaiah,38,9,"The text by Hezekiah, the ruler of Judah, when he was really sick but managed to bounce back:"
Isaiah,38,10,"I was like, when my days were being shortened, I thought I would end up in the grave. I feel like I've been robbed of the rest of my years."
Isaiah,38,11,"I was like, yo, I thought I wasn't gonna see the Lord, like ever, you know? Not in this life. I wassupposed to bounce and never see any more humans on this planet."
Isaiah,38,12,"Bro, I'm getting old real quick. It feels like my youth has just vanished, just like when a shepherd takes down his tent. My life is like a weaver's thread that has been cut off. I know I'm gonna get hit with some serious sickness that's gonna finish me off. It's like I'm running out of time, constantly, from morning to night."
Isaiah,38,13,"I was up all night thinking, and it feels like someone's gonna demolish me, just like a lion breaking all my bones. It's like you're gonna keep me down all day and all night."
Isaiah,38,14,"I was chatting away like a crane or a swallow, expressing my sorrow like a dove. My eyes were tired from looking up. O LORD, I feel overwhelmed; take care of me."
Isaiah,38,15,"Yo, what am I supposed to say? It's been spoken to me, and he himself has done it. I'm gonna take it easy and keep it lowkey, dealing with the bitterness in my soul."
Isaiah,38,16,"Yo, God, these things are what keep us alive, and they give life to my spirit too. Can you please restore me and revive me?"
Isaiah,38,17,"OMG, listen up! I went through some serious tough times that really messed me up, but you, out of all people, rescued me from the darkest hole. You've totally thrown away all my mistakes like they never even happened. #NewBeginnings"
Isaiah,38,18,"The grave can't even praise you, death can't throw a party in your honor, and those who end up in the pit can't even count on your truth."
Isaiah,38,19,"Yo, the people who are alive, they gonna give you mad props, just like I'm doing right now: the older folks gonna pass on your truth to their kids."
Isaiah,38,20,"God was totally down to save me, so we gonna jam to some sick tunes with those stringed instruments, like, forever and ever, whenever we chill at God's crib."
Isaiah,38,21,"Isaiah was like, 'Just grab some figs, slap ‘em on the boil, and watch the miraculous healing happen.'"
Isaiah,38,22,"Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, how am I gonna know if it's cool for me to go to the house of the LORD? What's the sign, bro?"
Isaiah,39,1,"Back in the day, there was this dude named Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, who was the king of Babylon. He decided to slide into Hezekiah's DMs with some letters and a sick gift. Why? Well, he heard that Hezekiah was sick but then miraculously bounced back."
Isaiah,39,2,"And Hezekiah was stoked about it, and showed them all his dope stuff, the cash, the bling, the sweet-smelling stuff, the fancy lotion, and all his sick armor, and everything he had stashed in his secret spots: there was literally nothing in his crib, or in his whole kingdom, that Hezekiah didn't flex on. {spicery: or, fancy spices} {armor: or, shiny jewels: Hebrew: vessels, or, instruments}"
Isaiah,39,3,"So Isaiah, the prophet, went up to king Hezekiah and asked him, 'Yo, what did those dudes say? And where did they come from, bro?' And Hezekiah replied, 'Oh, they came all the way from Babylon, man.'"
Isaiah,39,4,"So he asked, 'What did they see in your house?' And Hezekiah replied, 'They saw everything in my house. I didn't hide anything from them, even in my stash.'"
Isaiah,39,5,"So Isaiah was like, 'Yo Hezekiah, listen up to what the LORD of all the cool stuff gotta say:'"
Isaiah,39,6,"Yo, listen up! There's gonna be some serious stuff going down in the future. Everything you've got in your crib, including all that your parents have saved up until now, is gonna be taken to Babylon. Nada will be left behind, declares the LORD."
Isaiah,39,7,"And your future kids, born from you, will be taken away and serve as eunuchs in the king of Babylon's palace."
Isaiah,39,8,"Hezekiah was like, 'Yo Isaiah, that's some straight fire from the LORD right there. And check it, he said there's gonna be peace and truth up in my days.'"
Isaiah,40,1,"Yo, like, chill. Chill my peeps, says your God."
Isaiah,40,2,"Yo, like, spread the word to Jerusalem and tell her that her struggles are over, her wrongdoings are forgiven. She's straight up received double punishment for all her sins from the big man upstairs."
Isaiah,40,3,"Listen up, peeps! There's this guy shouting in the middle of nowhere, telling everyone to get ready for the entrance of the LORD. He wants us to clear a path straight through the desert like a freaking highway for our God."
Isaiah,40,4,"All those low points in life will get boosted up, and all those fancy high points will get brought down: the twisted paths will be made straight, and the bumpy places will be made smooth. {straight: or, a straightforward place} {plain: or, an easy place}"
Isaiah,40,5,"And like, everyone's gonna see the epic power of the LORD, yo! It's gonna be so lit when God's glory is revealed and all people witness it at the same time, for the LORD ain't playing around with this, he's seriously spoken it into existence."
Isaiah,40,6,"The voice was like, 'Yo, shout out!' And he was like, 'Yo, what should I shout?' Listen up, fam, here's the deal: all human beings are just like grass, and all their fancy stuff is as quick as a wildflower in the field."
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass be like, it gets all dried up and the flower be wilting too. It's 'cause the spirit of the LORD sweeps over 'em, you know? Like, for real, we people, we're just like grass, man."
Isaiah,40,8,"Like, the grass gets all withered and the flower, like, fades away, ya know? But, dude, the word of our God is, like, gonna, literally, stand forever, no cap."
Isaiah,40,9,"Yo, Zion, listen up! Climb that mountain and shout it out loud! Yo, Jerusalem, use your powerful voice, don't hold back! Rise up, don't be scared! Tell the cities of Judah, 'Check it out, your God is here!'"
Isaiah,40,10,"Yo, check it out! The mighty Lord GOD is gonna roll up with some serious power moves. His arm is gonna rule the game for him, no doubt. And guess what? He's bringing his rewards with him, like the ultimate boss. Plus, his work is right there in front of him, ready to be recognized. It's gonna be epic!"
Isaiah,40,11,"He's gonna take care of his crew like a boss: he'll round up the little ones with his strength, hold them close to his heart, and guide the moms with kindness. (or, those who are breastfeeding)"
Isaiah,40,12,"Like, imagine this, who even has the power to measure the vast oceans just by using his hand? And check this out, he can literally stretch out the heavens with his handspan! And get this, he knows exactly how much dust fills the earth, he's got it all measured up. He can even weigh mountains using scales, and balance out hills like it's no biggie. Mind-blowing, right?"
Isaiah,40,13,"Like, who can totally claim they know better than the LORD? Or like, who's even qualified to give Him advice and stuff? No one, man, no one."
Isaiah,40,14,"Yo, who's he always takin' advice from? Like, who's droppin' wisdom bombs on him and teachin' him how to make good decisions? And who's hookin' him up with all that knowledge and showin' him the way to true understanding? Like, straight up, who's helpin' him understand all this stuff?"
Isaiah,40,15,"Yo, check it out. The nations? Just a teensy drop in a bucket. They ain't nothin' but tiny specks of dust on a scale. And those islands? Barely even noticeable by our main dude."
Isaiah,40,16,"Lebanon can't even handle being a bonfire hotspot, and the animals there definitely won't cut it as sacrifices."
Isaiah,40,17,"Literally every single nation is like... absolutely nothing to Him, like seriously, not even worth a thought. He sees them as less than nothing, like complete emptiness. So yeah, kind of a big deal."
Isaiah,40,18,"So, like, who do you even think you can compare to God? Like, seriously, there's literally no one or nothing that even comes close to resembling Him."
Isaiah,40,19,"The craftsman melts a carved image, and the jeweler covers it with gold and puts silver chains on it."
Isaiah,40,20,"If you're broke and can't afford an offering, you might go for a tree that won't decay. You'll try to find a skilled craftsman to make a cool statue that won't fall over."
Isaiah,40,21,"Y'all haven't even caught up on this info? Like, haven't you heard? Hasn't someone filled you in since the beginning? Seriously, haven't you grasped this since the Earth was poppin' off?"
Isaiah,40,22,"Dude, imagine the one who's chilling on the Earth, like it's his massive throne or something. And all us peeps here, we're just tiny grasshoppers compared to him. He's the one who expands the sky like a fancy curtain, and sets it up like a cozy tent for us to live in."
Isaiah,40,23,"He completely humbles the powerful leaders, reducing them to insignificance; he renders the earthly judges utterly meaningless."
Isaiah,40,24,"Yeah, they ain't gonna get planted; yeah, they won't get sown. Their roots won't even grow in the ground, man. And then, bam, a gust of wind will hit 'em, and they'll shrivel up like dry grass, swept away in a tornado."
Isaiah,40,25,"So, like, who do you even think can compare to me? I mean, seriously? The Holy One, like, wants to know."
Isaiah,40,26,"Yo, check out the mega-awesome view up above and see who's responsible for creating all these amazing things! This homie brings out all the stars in proper order and even knows each one by name. He's ridiculously strong and powerful, never failing at anything."
Isaiah,40,27,"Yo, why you be sayin', Jacob, and talkin', Israel, like my life is lowkey hidden from the LORD, and God straight up ignorin' my situation?"
Isaiah,40,28,"Yo, didn't you know? Haven't you heard that God is like, forever and ever, the one who made the whole earth and stuff? He never gets tired or worn out. And yo, you can't even begin to understand how smart he is."
Isaiah,40,29,"He gives mad power to the tired; and to those who feel weak, he levels up their strength."
Isaiah,40,30,Even the youngins gonna be tired AF and the dudes in their prime gonna straight up collapse:
Isaiah,40,31,"Those who have patience and trust in the LORD will have their strength upgraded; they will soar high like majestic eagles; they will sprint without getting tired; and they will walk steadily, never losing their energy."
Isaiah,41,1,"Yo, islands, stay quiet and let the people get their strength back. Once they're ready, they can speak up. Let's all come together for some fair judgment."
Isaiah,41,2,"Yo, who's the one who brought up that righteous dude from the east, called him to step up, put entire nations under his control, and made him dominate over kings? He straight up made them as weak as dust to his sword, and as helpless as stubble blown away by his bow. #Righteousness"
Isaiah,41,3,"He totally chased after them and made it out unscathed, like, taking a whole different route he had never even set foot on before. It was, like, super peaceful and chill, you know?"
Isaiah,41,4,"Who's the one who made it happen and called all the generations from the start? It's me, the LORD, the OG, and I'm here from the beginning to the end; that's who I am."
Isaiah,41,5,"When the islands saw it, they were shook; even the farthest corners of the earth were straight up scared, came closer, and showed up."
Isaiah,41,6,"They totally had each other's backs and were like, 'Yo bro, stay strong and keep your head high.'"
Isaiah,41,7,"So, like, the carpenter hyped up the goldsmith, and the one who smooths things with a hammer hyped up the one who hit the anvil. They were all like, 'It's ready to be soldered!' And they nailed it down tight so it wouldn't budge. It was all like, 'Dude, this is solid!'"
Isaiah,41,8,"Yo, Israel, you're like my servant, Jacob, who I've totally handpicked, the descendant of Abraham who's basically my BFF."
Isaiah,41,9,"Yo, the one I picked from the farthest corners of the earth, I'm calling you out from the top dogs out there. I'm telling you, you're my BFF; I chose you and I ain't gonna ditch you."
Isaiah,41,10,"Don't stress; I got your back! Don't freak out; remember, I'm your homie! I'll boost your strength and lend a hand, supporting you with the power of my righteousness."
Isaiah,41,11,"Yo, listen up! Anybody who's been hatin' on you is gonna feel straight-up embarrassed and defeated. They'll be like total nobodies, no match for you. Those who try to come against you will straight-up vanish."
Isaiah,41,12,"You'll try to find them, but they'll be nowhere to be found, those who were against you. The ones who fought against you will be like nothing, completely irrelevant. No trace of them whatsoever."
Isaiah,41,13,"Yo, I gotchu! It's ya boy, the LORD your God, and I'm right here holdin' your hand. Don't trip, don't stress, I got this. I'm here to help you out, no doubt!"
Isaiah,41,14,"Don't worry, you underdog Jacob and all you people of Israel; I got your back, says the LORD, your savior, the ultimate one from Israel. Few men, not a biggie."
Isaiah,41,15,"Yo, check this out - I'm gonna hook you up with a brand new, ultra mega threshing tool that's gonna have some serious bite. You'll literally be crushing those mountains, reducing 'em to tiny pieces, and turning the hills into nothing but dust. (P.S. Threshing instrument with teeth actually means mouths in Hebrew - pretty cool, right?)"
Isaiah,41,16,"You're gonna flex on them, and the breeze gonna yeet them, and the tornado gonna spread them out: and you gonna be stoked in the LORD, and gonna hype up the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,41,17,"When the struggling and broke peeps be lookin' for some water, but it's nowhere to be found, and their mouths be dry af, ya boy the LORD gonna hear 'em, 'cause I, the God of Israel, ain't gonna abandon 'em."
Isaiah,41,18,"I'm gonna unleash mad rivers in the sickest spots, and drop sweet fountains in the valleys. The barren wilderness? Yeah, I'll transform that into a lit waterpark, and the dry land will be popping with refreshing springs."
Isaiah,41,19,"In the middle of nowhere, I'm gonna grow some dope cedar, shittah tree, myrtle, and oil tree; out in the desert, I'll put some lit fir tree, pine, and box tree all together."
Isaiah,41,20,"So that everyone can peep, vibe, reflect, and grasp the fact that it's all thanks to God's awesome power and the Holy One of Israel made it happen."
Isaiah,41,21,"Yo, present your case, says the LORD. Bring out your strongest arguments, says the King of Jacob. Show up and make your points, yo."
Isaiah,41,22,"Yo, let them peeps step up and show us what's gonna go down. Like, reveal the stuff that happened already, so we can check 'em out and know how it all ends. Or spill the tea on what's coming in the future. Let's see if they got the deets."
Isaiah,41,23,"Bring on the future stuff, so we can see if you're really gods. Do something awesome or something terrible, so we can be totally surprised and witness the whole thing together."
Isaiah,41,24,"Yo, check this out, y'all really ain't worth a thing, and all the stuff you be doin' is straight-up useless. It's seriously messed up to even pick you to be on your team. Real talk, you're worse than absolute zero, straight-up garbage."
Isaiah,41,25,"Yo, I'm bringing someone from up north, and he's about to make his entrance. He's gonna call out to me from the east, where the sun rises. This dude is gonna completely own those high and mighty rulers, crushing them like how a potter does with clay."
Isaiah,41,26,"Like, who's out here, like, revealing stuff from the beginning so that we can, like, know and stuff? And, like, who's doing it before anyone else, so that we can, like, say that they're righteous? Yeah, no one's, like, stepping up to show or declare anything or even like, listen to what you're saying. None of that, man."
Isaiah,41,27,"Yo, listen up! Check it out, check it out, fam: I'm gonna send someone to Zion and give Jerusalem some awesome news."
Isaiah,41,28,"So like, I looked around and couldn't find anyone, I mean seriously, not a single person. And to make things worse, there wasn't even someone I could go to for advice or anything. Like, I asked around but got zero responses. It was just crickets, man."
Isaiah,41,29,"Look, all that stuff is like totally pointless; their actions mean zilch: those statues they worship are just empty air and utter chaos."
Isaiah,42,1,"Check out my servant, I totally support him; he's my chosen one, and I'm super stoked about him. I've given him my spirit, and he'll totally serve justice to all the non-Jewish peeps."
Isaiah,42,2,"He won't be all loud and extra, shouting and causing a scene in the streets."
Isaiah,42,3,He won't snap a damaged reed or extinguish a flickering flame: he will bring forth justice with integrity.
Isaiah,42,4,He won't give up or lose hope until he establishes justice in the world. People from all over will eagerly follow his laws.
Isaiah,42,5,"God be like, listen up fam, I'm the one who made the sky and stretched it out, I'm the one who made the earth and everything that comes from it. I'm the one giving breath to all the people on it and spirit to those walking around."
Isaiah,42,6,"Yo, it's me, the LORD, hittin' you up with some truth. I'm calling you out to do what's right, and I got your back for real. I'll guide you and protect you, and yo, you gonna be a real blessing to the peeps. You gonna shine like a bright light for all the non-Jewish crew too, no doubt!"
Isaiah,42,7,"To help people see clearly again, to free those held captive, and to rescue those who are stuck in dark places."
Isaiah,42,8,"I'm the LORD - that's my name, and I'm not gonna let anyone else take credit for my awesomeness. Graven images don't deserve my praise either."
Isaiah,42,9,"Listen up, what went down before is history, but get ready for the new stuff I'm about to spill: I'm letting you in on the deets before they even happen, way ahead of time."
Isaiah,42,10,"Yo, vibe out to the LORD with a fresh new jam, and shout out His name from every corner of the globe! Whether you're chilling by the beach or sailing the seas, let all the islands and their peeps join in too. Embrace the whole vibe, including everything it's got to offer!"
Isaiah,42,11,"Yo, listen up! The wilderness and the cities, even the villages inhabited by Kedar, need to raise their voices. Let the people dwelling in rocky areas sing out and shout from the mountain peaks."
Isaiah,42,12,"Praise the LORD and spread the word about how awesome He is, even in the most far-out places."
Isaiah,42,13,"The LORD is about to come out like a total badass, stirring up jealousy like a warrior. He's gonna shout and roar, completely owning his enemies. {prevail: or, totally dominating}"
Isaiah,42,14,"I've been silent for a while, keeping my thoughts to myself. But now, I'm about to unleash my emotions like a woman in labor. I'll take over and consume everything all at once."
Isaiah,42,15,"I'll totally wreck those mountains and hills, drying up all the plants. The rivers will turn into islands, and even the pools will dry up."
Isaiah,42,16,"And like, I'm gonna guide the blind in a totally new direction, you know? Leading them on paths they've never even heard of. I'll light up the darkness in front of them and make all the confusing stuff straight. Trust me, I've got their back and won't bail on them, okay?"
Isaiah,42,17,"Those people who rely on fake idols and claim that those lifeless statues are our gods, will ultimately be disappointed and deeply embarrassed."
Isaiah,42,18,"Yo, listen up, you deaf peeps, and pay attention, you blind fam, so you can gain some insight."
Isaiah,42,19,"Yo, who's straight up blind like my homie here? Or who's deaf like the messenger I sent? Ain't nobody blind like the one who thinks they're flawless and devoted to the LORD."
Isaiah,42,20,"You see so much, but you don't really notice anything; you hear all the time, but you don't truly listen."
Isaiah,42,21,"God is totally stoked about his righteousness; he's gonna hype up the law and make it really awesome and respected. Him or it, either way!"
Isaiah,42,22,"But yo, these people got jacked and looted. They all stuck in traps and locked up in jail cells. They be easy targets, and nobody coming to their rescue or saying, 'Give 'em back their stuff.' They straight up getting trampled on and nobody even cares to fix it."
Isaiah,42,23,"Yo, listen up! Who's willing to pay attention to this? Who's gonna open their ears and listen for what's about to go down in the future? Like, seriously, who's got that foresight?"
Isaiah,42,24,"Yo, like, who let Jacob get wiped out and Israel get looted by thieves? Wasn't it the LORD, the one we messed up with our sins and disobedience? They totally didn't follow His ways or His laws, you know."
Isaiah,42,25,"So, God unleashed his intense anger and power on him, like a fierce battle engulfing him in flames. But he remained oblivious, even as he was consumed by the fire. He didn't realize the severity of the situation."
Isaiah,43,1,"Yo, listen up! The Almighty, who made you, Jacob, and formed you, Israel, has got a message for you: Don't be afraid, 'cause I've got your back. I've redeemed you, I've called you by your name. You belong to me, fam."
Isaiah,43,2,"When you go through tough times, I'll be right there with you; even if the challenges seem overwhelming, they won't take you down. When you face impossible situations, you won't get burned; the fire won't harm you."
Isaiah,43,3,"Hey, I'm God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I totally sacrificed Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba just to save you."
Isaiah,43,4,"Dude, you've always been special to me. I've always seen you as someone important and dignified, and I've totally loved you, bro. So, just know, I'm willing to give up other people for you, man. Like, you mean everything to me."
Isaiah,43,5,"Don't worry, I got your back! I'll hook you up by bringing your crew from all over the place!"
Isaiah,43,6,"I'm like, calling out to the north, like 'yo, let go'; and to the south, don't hold back: bring my boys from far away, and my girls from all corners of the earth."
Isaiah,43,7,"Like, everyone who's called by my name, you know? Cause I totally created them to bring glory to me. I designed and made each one, no doubt about it."
Isaiah,43,8,"Gather the visually impaired peeps with mad observation skills, and the audibly challenged ones with epic listening game."
Isaiah,43,9,"Ok listen up everyone, let's gather all the nations and get the people together. Now, here's a challenge: anyone among them think they can explain all this and let us know what happened in the past? They better bring some solid evidence to back it up, or else they better just admit that what we're saying is the truth."
Isaiah,43,10,"Yo, you guys are like my besties, says the LORD, and you're my chosen squad: so you can totally know, trust, and get that I'm the real deal. There ain't no other God before me or after me, like, ever."
Isaiah,43,11,"I'm, like, the LORD, totally the one and only savior. No one else even comes close, yo."
Isaiah,43,12,"Yo, I've straight-up declared it and come through, and I've made it known to you, when there wasn't any other weird god in the mix: so, you all are my squad, says the LORD, to testify that I'm the real deal, God."
Isaiah,43,13,"Yeah, even before today, I've always been here; and no one can save you from me, no cap: I'm about to make moves, and who's gonna stop it? Like, seriously, who's gonna try?"
Isaiah,43,14,"Listen up! The Almighty God, your rescuer, the Holy One of Israel, has a message for you: I made a move to Babylon just for you, totally bringing down their fancy rulers and the Chaldeans who love sailing on ships. #powermove #noblescrushed #ChaldeanSailors"
Isaiah,43,15,"Yo, I'm the LORD, your Holy One, the one who made Israel, your ultimate ruler."
Isaiah,43,16,"Listen up, fam! The Lord, the one who straight up makes a path in the sea and a track in the craziest waters, has this to say:"
Isaiah,43,17,"Like, imagine a sick ride with horses and a whole squad, flexing their power. But then, they crash and burn, totally wiped out and fizzled away, just like a burnt-out cigarette."
Isaiah,43,18,"Don't dwell on the past, and don't get caught up in old trends."
Isaiah,43,19,"Yo, listen up! Something fresh is about to go down. Can't you see it? I'm gonna make a path in the middle of nowhere and bring rivers to the dang desert!"
Isaiah,43,20,"The wild creatures will show me respect, including the cool dragons and the trendy owls. It's because I hook them up with water in the middle of nowhere, and rivers in the seriously dry desert. This way, I make sure my peeps, the ones I've chosen, stay hydrated. (BTW, the Hebrew word for 'owls' could also mean 'ostriches'. Just an FYI!)"
Isaiah,43,21,I made these peeps for myself; they gonna flex and spread my good vibes.
Isaiah,43,22,"Yo, Jacob, you haven't been hittin' me up; you're straight up tired of me, Israel."
Isaiah,43,23,"Bruh, you haven't even brought me the lit lambs or goats for your burnt offerings, and you haven't even shown me respect with your sacrifices. Like, I haven't even asked you to work hard or bother you with incense offerings, fam. (BTW, small cattle means lambs or kids in case you didn't know)"
Isaiah,43,24,"You didn't spend any cash on sweet stuff for me, and you haven't stuffed me with the best of your offerings. But instead, you've made me work for you by doing wrong things, and you've tired me out with your wickedness."
Isaiah,43,25,"Yo, I'm the one who cancels out all your mistakes, like seriously. And get this, I don't even keep record of your wrongs. No cap."
Isaiah,43,26,"Yo, yo, remember what's up: let's have a chat, let's lay it all out and make our case, so you can prove yourself right."
Isaiah,43,27,"Bruh, your original ancestor messed up big time, and your influencers have straight up betrayed me. Ayo, those 'interpreters' who were supposed to guide you? Yeah, they crossed the line."
Isaiah,43,28,"So basically, I disrespected the super important people in the holy place and kinda brought bad luck to Jacob and Israel. Like, they're getting talked about in a really mean way and stuff. You know, those important dudes in the holy place?"
Isaiah,44,1,"Yo, listen up, Jacob my homie; and Israel, the squad I've handpicked:"
Isaiah,44,2,"Listen up, fam! This is a message straight from the LORD, the one who created and shaped you since you were in the womb. Don't stress, Jacob, my loyal servant, and you too, Jesurun, the one I specifically picked out."
Isaiah,44,3,"Because I'll quench the thirst of those who are craving, and overflow the barren land with floods: I'll pour out my spirit on your generation, and shower my blessings on your descendants:"
Isaiah,44,4,"And they gonna pop out like fresh grass, just like chill willows by the flowing streams."
Isaiah,44,5,"Someone will be like, 'I'm repping the LORD,' and another person will be like, 'Nah, just call me Jacob.' Then you got someone who's all like, 'Watch me sign up for the LORD's crew and be known as Israel.'"
Isaiah,44,6,"God, the ultimate flex, says: 'I run the show, I'm the OG and the grand finale. No other Supreme Being comes close.'"
Isaiah,44,7,"And who, like me, can confidently call out and declare, and organize everything for me, as I have chosen the wise ones since ancient times? Let them reveal the future and upcoming events."
Isaiah,44,8,"Don't stress, don't be scared - I've been telling you this from the start, and you all can back me up on it. Is there any other God out there? Nope, I don't know of any. *drops mic*"
Isaiah,44,9,"Anyone who makes an idol is just chasing after something useless; their fancy stuff won't do them any good. They're basically clueless, blind to the truth, and too dumb to even realize it. Talk about embarrassing."
Isaiah,44,10,"Like, who even tries to make their own god or like, mold a useless statue? So pointless."
Isaiah,44,11,"Yo, listen up! All of his homies are gonna be mad embarrassed, and those dudes who think they're so skilled? Yeah, they're just regular people. Bring 'em all together, let 'em try to front, but deep down, they're gonna be scared and humiliated, no doubt!"
Isaiah,44,12,"The blacksmith uses tongs to handle the hot coals, shapes it with hammers, and uses all his strength. But hey, he gets hungry and tired, doesn't even have time to drink water, and feels exhausted."
Isaiah,44,13,"The carpenter straight up flexes his measuring tool, makes some precise measurements with a line, smoothens it out with planes, traces it with a compass, and crafts it into the shape of a human, making it look as fine as a human being. All this swag to make sure it stays put in the crib."
Isaiah,44,14,"He cuts down cedars and takes the cypress and the oak, which he uses to build himself a dope crib in the forest. He plants an ash tree, and the rain keeps it feeling fresh and nourished. 🌲"
Isaiah,44,15,"Yo, like when this thing is on fire, a dude can use it to warm up, ya know? And he can light it up, bake some bread, or even make it into some idol to worship. He can totally carve an image out of it and bow down to it."
Isaiah,44,16,"He like totally burns some of it in the fire, then eats the tasty meat. He grills it until it's all nice and cooked, and it makes him oh so satisfied. He warms himself and says, like, Yasss, I'm warm, I've felt the fire, dude!"
Isaiah,44,17,"Then he takes the leftover materials and makes a god out of it - yep, a literal statue. And get this, he actually bows down to it, worships it, and even prays to it, saying, 'Save me, because you're my god!'"

Isaiah,45,22,"Yo, everybody out there, peep at me and get saved. No cap, I'm God, and there's no one else like me."

Isaiah,47,13,"Dude, you're exhausted from all your overthinking. So why don't you turn to those astrology buffs and fortune tellers? Let them try and save you from the bad stuff that's about to go down. (FYI, astrologers means those who study the stars and monthly prognosticators means those who predict the future based on the months.)"

Isaiah,48,6,"Yo, you've heard and seen all of this, but seriously, why aren't you talking about it? I've just dropped some fresh knowledge bombs that you've never even heard before. Straight up hidden gems, and you had no clue about it."
Isaiah,48,7,"They're basically new, not from way back, even before you didn't know anything about them; so you can't be all like, 'Yo, I totally saw that coming.'"

Isaiah,49,5,"And now, listen up y'all, the LORD who created me since I was in my mommy's tummy so I could serve Him and bring Jacob back to Him. Even if Israel ain't coming together, I'll still shine in the LORD's eyes, and my God will be my strength. *drops mic*"

Isaiah,52,4,"Here's what the Lord GOD says: Back in the day, my people headed to Egypt to chill for a while, and then the Assyrians came in and messed with them for no reason at all."
Isaiah,52,5,"Yo, like, why am I here, says the LORD? My people are just getting jacked with no reason. The ones in charge of them are causing them to scream, says the LORD. And, yo, my name is getting disrespected every day, non-stop."
Isaiah,52,6,"So, like, my people will totally recognize my name, you know? And on that day they're gonna be like, 'Whoa, this is the real deal! It's actually me, the one doing the talking!' Like, seriously, it's all me, no doubt about it!"

Isaiah,52,14,"So many people were shook when they saw him; his face was messed up, like worse than anyone else's, and his overall look was totally different from regular dudes:"
Isaiah,52,15,He's gonna blow up on a global scale; even the highest bosses gonna be speechless. They gonna witness things they never even imagined and really think about stuff they never heard before.
Isaiah,53,1,"Bruh, who actually believed what we said? And who's seen God do his thing up close? Like, seriously, who's paying attention?"
Isaiah,53,2,"Like, he's gonna grow up in front of everyone, you know, just like a small plant in a totally dry ground. He won't have this like stunning appearance, you know what I mean? Like, we won't be all like 'Oh wow, he's so good-looking!' Nah, there won't be any desire for him based on his looks."
Isaiah,53,3,People thought he was trash and wanted nothing to do with him; he carried a lot of sadness and knew what it felt like to be down. We acted like he didn't exist and didn't think he was worth anything.
Isaiah,53,4,"Like, bruh, he totally took on our struggles and carried our pain. But, like, we totally thought he was being punished and messed up by God, you know, had a rough time and all."
Isaiah,53,5,"But like, he got hurt because of our mess-ups, ya know? He took the beatings for our wrongdoings. The punishment that was meant to disturb our inner peace, he took it upon himself. And because of his suffering, we find healing. Like, he got tormented for us, ya know? And those bruises, they made us whole."

Isaiah,53,11,"He's gonna witness all the struggles he went through and feel totally content with it. By sharing his wisdom, my righteous servant is gonna make a whole lot of people righteous too, 'cause he's gonna take on their sins."
Isaiah,53,12,"So basically, this dude's gonna share the loot with the big shots, 'cause he gave everything, even his life. He got put in the same category as the troublemakers, but held the burden of sin for a bunch of people and stood up for them."

Isaiah,54,17,"No weapon can touch you, fam, it's all futile. Any haters trying to bring you down will suffer defeat. This is how the squad of the Almighty gets down, and their righteousness comes straight from the boss himself. God speaking, no cap."
Isaiah,55,1,"Yo, all y'all who crave something real, head over to the spot where it's flowing. And if you broke, no worries; come through, cop what you need, indulge in some fine wine and creamy milk, no cash required, no strings attached."
Isaiah,55,2,"Why are you wasting your cash on things that aren't even satisfying? And why are you grinding away at stuff that doesn't bring you joy? Listen up, peeps, and feast on the good stuff that truly fills you up and makes your soul happy. It's time to prioritize what really matters, fam!"

Isaiah,55,6,"Yo fam, go after the LORD while you still got the chance, hit him up while he's close by, you feel me?"
Isaiah,55,7,"If you're out here being shady and doing wrong, it's time to switch it up. Leave behind your wicked path and your messed up mindset. Instead, come back to the LORD and watch as he shows you mad love and forgives you big time. Our God is all about that abundant pardon, no doubt."
Isaiah,55,8,"My mindset isn't the same as yours, and my approach is different too, says the LORD."
Isaiah,55,9,"Like, the heavens are so much higher than the earth, right? Well, my ways are like, even higher than your ways, and my thoughts are on a whole different level than yours."
Isaiah,55,10,"Like when it rains or snows, it doesn't just vanish into thin air. Instead, it nourishes the earth, causing it to produce plants and flowers, which provide seeds for planting and food for people to eat:"
Isaiah,55,11,"This is how it goes: When I speak, my words aren't just empty. They actually do what I want and succeed at what I send them out to do."
Isaiah,55,12,"Cuz you'll bounce out with mad joy, totally chill vibes guiding you. The mountains and hills gonna bust out in some sick tunes, and all the trees in the fields gonna be clappin' like they're at a lit concert."
Isaiah,55,13,"The thorny vibes will be replaced by chill fir trees, and the annoying briers will turn into awesome myrtle trees. It's all about giving props to the LORD and making a permanent statement that can never be trashed."
Isaiah,56,1,"Yo, listen up! The LORD is like, 'Hey, make sure y'all are fair and just in your actions, 'cause I'm bringing salvation real soon and about to show off my righteousness. It's all about being fair and equal, you feel me? #Equity"
Isaiah,56,2,"Dude, you'll be totally blessed if you do this, and bro, if you're all about it, you'll be on fire. Just make sure you respect the sabbath and don't mess it up, and keep your hands away from any bad stuff."
Isaiah,56,3,"Don't let someone who isn't originally one of God's peeps and has now committed to being part of the fam, start talking like, Godd doesn't want me around His crew anymore.' And also, don't let someone who's not able to have kids be all like, 'I'm useless and got no future.'"
Isaiah,56,4,"So, like, God's saying to the eunuchs who are all committed to keeping my sabbaths, and like, they choose stuff that makes me happy and totally embrace my covenant;"
Isaiah,56,5,"Yo, I'm hooking them up big time in my crib! They'll have a spot and a rep that's even more lit than being called sonss' or 'daughters.' I'll bless them with a name that's forever, no one can flex and take it away."
Isaiah,56,6,"And even if you're not from around here, but you decide to connect with the big man upstairs, devoting yourself to serving Him and showing mad love for His name, becoming His ride-or-die crew, anyone who respects the day of rest and rocks with His sacred agreement;"
Isaiah,56,7,I'll bring even those guys to my super holy mountain and make them stoked in my chill house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will totally be accepted on my rad altar because my crib is gonna be the spot for prayer for everyone.
Isaiah,56,8,"The Lord GOD, who brings together all the rejected ones of Israel, says, 'I'll even gather more people to Him, in addition to those who are already gathered.'"
Isaiah,56,9,"Hey, wild creatures of the field, time to feast! Yeah, all you forest-dwelling animals, join in too."
Isaiah,56,10,"Bro, these watchmen be blind AF, like they clueless. They just some dumb dogs, can't even bark. They always sleeping, lying around, totally into slumber. (or maybe dreaming or talking in their sleep, who knows)"
Isaiah,56,11,"Like, wow, those dudes are such greedy dogs, you know? They can never get enough, man. And those shepherds, they're totally clueless. They're all just focused on their own way and only care about making gains for themselves. It's like they have this insatiable appetite and they don't even know what it means to be satisfied."
Isaiah,56,12,"Yo, let's go and get some wine, and get turnt up! And tomorrow will be just as lit, or even better!"
Isaiah,57,1,"Like, the good people, they die, and it's like no one even cares, you know? And the kind-hearted ones just get taken away, and nobody realizes that they're being spared from the future evil stuff, you feel me?"
Isaiah,57,2,"They'll chillax and find their zen in their cozy beds, walking in their true selves. It's their personal journey, straight up."
Isaiah,57,3,"Yo, listen up, you offspring of spellcasters, descendants of cheaters and promiscuous people, come closer here."
Isaiah,57,4,"Why are you mocking others? Why are you being all sassy and disrespectful? Aren't you just a bunch of troublemakers, spreading lies around?"
Isaiah,57,5,"Are you guys really getting hyped up about idols and stuff, doing your thing under every tree, and straight up hurting kids in the valleys by the rocky cliffs? Like, seriously? 🌳💥😱"
Isaiah,57,6,"Chillin' by the cool stream, you scored some rad smooth stones as your share. They're totally your thing, man. You even poured a drink and offered some food as gratitude. But really, should I find solace in these things?"
Isaiah,57,7,"You picked a super epic spot on a massive mountain to chill and worship, just had to climb all the way up there to make your sacrifices."
Isaiah,57,8,"You've placed your reminder behind closed doors and doorposts. Because you've revealed yourself to someone other than me, you've gone up and made your bed bigger, and entered into an agreement with them. You loved their bed when you saw it, and you even made yours bigger than theirs."
Isaiah,57,9,"And like, you straight up went to the king with that top-tier ointment, and you were like slaying it with your bomb perfumes, and you even sent your squad on a mega long-distance mission, like, way far out, and you brought yourself down to hell, like no cap. Respect."
Isaiah,57,10,"Dude, you're like totally tired from all the ups and downs on this crazy journey you're on. But hey, don't give up hope! You've actually found some real joy in what you're doing, so don't let it bring you down, man. Keep rocking it!"
Isaiah,57,11,Who even scares you? Why would you lie and forget about me? Have you not realized that I've been silent for a long time and you don't even fear me?
Isaiah,57,12,"I'm gonna speak up about how righteous and lit your actions are, but tbh, they're not gonna level you up in any way."
Isaiah,57,13,"When you're in need, rely on your squad to help you out, but they're as flaky as the wind and won't stick around for long. They're just chasing after empty things. But if you put your faith in me, you'll be the one owning the place and inheriting my rad mountain."
Isaiah,57,14,"And they will be like, 'Yo, clear the path, clear the path, make way, remove anything that's tripping up my crew.'"
Isaiah,57,15,"Yo, listen up! The big guy up there, the one who's been around forever, whose name is Holy, he lives in the ultimate holy spot. And guess what? He's chilling with those who got a humble and repentant attitude. He's all about bringing back the spirit of the humble and giving a new spark to the hearts of those who are truly sorry."
Isaiah,57,16,"Dude, listen up! I won't keep beefin' with y'all forever, and I won't stay mad forever either. 'Cause let's be real, your spirit and the souls I created might not be able to handle it, man. So chill."
Isaiah,57,17,"I got mad at him because of his greed, and I gave him a smack: I went into hiding and stayed mad, but he kept going off track, doing whatever he pleased."
Isaiah,57,18,"I've peeped his moves, and I'll totally help him out: I'll guide him and bring back the good vibes for him and his sad squad."
Isaiah,57,19,"I'm all about spreading good vibes! I make your words count and bring peace to everyone, whether they're far away or right beside you, says the LORD. And I'll totally help you heal, no doubt."
Isaiah,57,20,"But the bad guys are totally like a chaotic ocean, always restless and tossing up all kinds of gross stuff."
Isaiah,57,21,"Sorry fam, but my God ain't about that peace for the wicked lifestyles."
Isaiah,58,1,"Make some noise, don't hold back, raise your voice like a trumpet, and show my peeps where they messed up, and the house of Jacob where they screwed up."
Isaiah,58,2,"But they're out here, seeking me every single day, totally vibing with my ways. They're like a whole nation that's all about doing the right thing, sticking to their God's rules and all. They're always hitting me up, asking about fairness and justice, genuinely lovin' that connection with God."
Isaiah,58,3,"So like, we're all wondering why we're fasting and stuff, but God, you don't even notice? And we're like, all about self-sacrifice but you're not even paying attention, y'know? But check it, during our fasting days, we're just out having a good time and making everyone else do all the work. It's like we're causing grief to others instead of doing what fasting is supposed to be about."
Isaiah,58,4,"Listen up, guys. You're fasting just to argue and fight, and to crush others with wickedness. But that's not how you should fast. Today, you're just trying to make yourself heard loud and clear. #NotCool"
Isaiah,58,5,"Like, is this the kind of fasting I actually want? Like, just a day where you're all sad and stuff? Where you're just moping around and acting all humble? Is that what you think fasting is all about and that God will be pleased with that? Seriously, just fasting for one day?"
Isaiah,58,6,"Isn't this what fasting is all about? Breaking free from wickedness, relieving ourselves from heavy burdens, liberating the oppressed, and removing every kind of oppression?"
Isaiah,58,7,"Hey, isn't it like super important to share your food with those who are hungry, and invite those who have been left out to your place? And when you see someone who's without clothes, you should totally hook them up and not ignore your own family in need, ya know?"
Isaiah,58,8,"Your vibe will be lit like the break of dawn. And you'll bounce back with good health real quick. Your integrity will lead the way, and God's awesomeness will have your back."
Isaiah,58,9,"When you hit up the Almighty, he's gonna hit you back; when you scream for help, he's gonna be like, 'Yo, I'm here, bro.' But here's the thing, if you get rid of all that unnecessary drama, stop pointing fingers, and quit talking nonsense, that's when things really start to go down."
Isaiah,58,10,"If you make an effort to help out those in need, feeding the hungry and comforting the afflicted, you'll see your own potential shine through even in tough times, like the brightness of the midday sun."
Isaiah,58,11,"God will always show you the way, and fulfill your heart even in tough times. You'll be strong and flourishing like a well-nourished garden, and your spirit will always be replenished like an everlasting spring."
Isaiah,58,12,And the people from your generation will rebuild the abandoned spots of the past. You will bring back the traditions of our ancestors and be known as the one who fixes broken relationships and restores the paths for us to live in.
Isaiah,58,13,"If you don't go about doing whatever you want on the Sabbath, my special day, and actually take pleasure in observing it as a holy day dedicated to the LORD, treating it with respect and honor, not doing your own thing, or seeking your own happiness, or babbling on about nonsense..."
Isaiah,58,14,"You'll totally vibe with the LORD and He'll hook you up with the best perks - like riding high and enjoying the blessings of Jacob your father. The LORD said it and He's got your back, for real."
Isaiah,59,1,"Yo, listen up! God's got mad skills, nothing's too tough for Him to handle. He's always got your back, no matter what's going on. His signals are always open, no missed connections here!"
Isaiah,59,2,"Dude, your wrongdoings have caused a major gap between you and God. Your sins have straight up made Him hide His face from you, so He won't even hear you out. It's like your non-stop messin' up is drivin' Him away, dude."
Isaiah,59,3,"Dude, your hands are stained with blood and your fingers are full of wickedness. Your lips are always spitting out lies and your tongue just can't stop mumbling twisted stuff."
Isaiah,59,4,"No one cares about fairness or fights for the truth: they're all caught up in superficiality and spewing out lies. They're constantly scheming, giving birth to wickedness."
Isaiah,59,5,"They've got this thing going where they breed dangerous snakes and create intricate spider webs. Anyone who dares to eat those snake eggs will suffer death, and even if you just step on them, a venomous viper will appear out of nowhere."
Isaiah,59,6,"They can't use their webs as cool outfits, and they can't hide behind their accomplishments. Their achievements are totally shady, and they're all about causing harm."
Isaiah,59,7,"They're always rushing towards doing harmful things, eager to cause harm to innocent people. Their minds are constantly preoccupied with sinful thoughts, leaving behind a trail of devastation and destruction."
Isaiah,59,8,"They have no clue about finding peace; their actions lack fairness. They have created twisted paths, and anyone who follows them will never find true peace."
Isaiah,59,9,"So basically, we're totally lacking in justice, no one's getting what they deserve. We're just sitting here waiting for things to get better, but it's like everything's just getting worse. We thought things would be bright and clear, but it feels like we're stuck in this never-ending darkness."
Isaiah,59,10,"We're literally feeling around for a wall, just like blind people, going about like we've got no eyes: tripping over ourselves in broad daylight, acting like it's pitch black out here; wandering through deserted spots like we're straight-up zombies."
Isaiah,59,11,"We're all like bears, making loud noises and grieving like doves. We're desperately seeking justice, but it's nowhere to be found; we're longing for deliverance, but it feels so distant."
Isaiah,59,12,"Our wrongdoings keep piling up, making it painfully obvious that we messed up big time. Our sins are straight up calling us out. We can't hide from the consequences of our actions – we know exactly what we did wrong."
Isaiah,59,13,"When we disrespect and lie to God, and turn away from Him, speaking harshly and rebelling, coming up with fake words and speaking them from our hearts."
Isaiah,59,14,"And justice has been flipped, facing the wrong way, like, totally backwards. It's like justice is, you know, miles away, like so far. Truth has totally bit the dust in the streets, and fairness can't even get a foot in the door."
Isaiah,59,15,"Honestly, facts and honesty are becoming scarce these days; anyone who chooses to distance themselves from doing wrong puts themselves at risk for being targeted. And God saw all this, and it really bothered Him that there was no justice or fairness. It was totally not cool in His eyes."
Isaiah,59,16,"So, like, he realized that no one was around to help, and he was totally shocked that there wasn't any mediator. That's when he used his power to bring salvation to himself and his righteousness kept him going."
Isaiah,59,17,He wore righteousness like a dope bulletproof vest and had a sick helmet of salvation on his head. He rocked vengeance as his swag outfit and was covered in passion like a lit cloak.
Isaiah,59,18,"Based on what they've done, he's gonna show them what's up, giving fury to his haters and payback to his enemies; even those far away will get what's coming to them."
Isaiah,59,19,"People gonna be mad respectful of the LORD all the way from the west to the east when they see how awesome he is. And watch out when the enemy tries to come at us, it's the LORD's Spirit that's gonna straight up shut them down!"
Isaiah,59,20,"And the Savior's gonna show up in Zion, yeah, and to all the peeps in Jacob who've ditched their wicked ways, the LORD has spoken, yo."
Isaiah,59,21,"Yo, listen up. This is the deal between me and them, says the LORD. I'm hooking them up with my spirit, like, it's gonna be with you always. And the words I've given you, they're gonna be spoken by you, your kids, and your grandkids, for real. This is gonna be an eternal thing, trust me, says the LORD."
Isaiah,60,1,"Yo, wake up and shine your light, 'cause the glory of the LORD is here for you. It's time to get enlightened, 'cause your light is on its way!"
Isaiah,60,2,"Yo, listen up! Picture this: the whole world wrapped in darkness, and the people lost in deep shadows. But don't trip, 'cause the LORD's gonna rise up and shine His glory on you. You'll be rockin' that divine light!"
Isaiah,60,3,"And the non-believers will be drawn to your shining presence, and even rulers will seek the brilliance of your ascent."
Isaiah,60,4,"Look around you and see: everyone is coming together, they're all headed your way. Your squad is gonna come from far and your girls will be right by your side."
Isaiah,60,5,"And you'll be amazed, come together, and your heart will be filled with awe and excitement; because the plenty of possibilities will flow towards you, the influential power of different cultures will come your way."
Isaiah,60,6,"Get ready, 'cause you're gonna be swarmed by a whole army of camels - Midian and Ephah's got those speedy dromedaries too! Everyone from Sheba's coming your way, bringing with them loads of gold and incense. They're gonna make sure to spread the word about how awesome the LORD is!"
Isaiah,60,7,"All the cool sheep of Kedar will come chill with you, the awesome rams of Nebaioth will serve you: they'll show up at my altar with mad respect, and I'll make my glorious mansion shine even brighter."
Isaiah,60,8,"Like, who are these people that are like totally flying around, like as a cloud, and like doves flying to their windows?"
Isaiah,60,9,"The islands will totally wait for me, and the Tarshish ships will be the first to bring your peeps from far away, bringing their mad silver and gold with them, all in the name of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he totally made you look awesome."

Isaiah,63,14,"Like, imagine a wild animal heading into the valley, and it's like the Spirit of the LORD totally guided it to a chill resting spot. That's exactly how you led your peeps, making a name for yourself in the most epic way possible!"

Isaiah,65,1,"Yo, like, people who never even thought of seeking me out, they be lookin' for me, and I'm there! And those who never even thought of searching for me, they be findin' me too! I'm like, 'Yo, yo, check me out!' to a nation that didn't even know my name, but here I am."
Isaiah,65,2,"All day long, I've been reaching out to a bunch of rebellious peeps, who are going down a super sketchy path 'cause they're only following their own messed up ideas;"
Isaiah,65,3,"These people keep getting on my nerves, always disrespecting me right in front of my face. They think it's cool to make sacrifices in fancy gardens and burn incense on cool brick altars."
Isaiah,65,4,"They be hanging around tombs, crashing at the burial sites, munching on bacon, and slurping up all sorts of nasty stuff in their containers."
Isaiah,65,5,"They're like, 'Stay away from me, I'm all holy and better than you.' Ugh, they just make me furious all day long, like smoke in my face or a burning fire."
Isaiah,65,6,"Listen up, it's right here in front of me: I won't stay quiet, but I'll make sure they get what they deserve, right back at them."
Isaiah,65,7,"Your wrongdoings, and the wrongdoings of your ancestors, according to the LORD, who have offered incense on the mountains and disrespected me on the hills. That's why I'll bring back the consequences of their past actions onto them."
Isaiah,65,8,"God says, like, when you find new wine in a bunch of grapes and someone's like, 'Don't ruin it!' because it's actually a good thing, yeah, that's what I'm gonna do for my peeps. I won't just wipe everyone out, you know, 'cause I got love for my servants and stuff."
Isaiah,65,9,"Yo, I'm gonna bring a dope generation from Jacob, and from Judah, someone worthy of inheriting my mountains. They're my chosen ones, man, they're gonna live it up there, and my faithful peeps will call it home."
Isaiah,65,10,"And Sharon will be like an awesome hangout spot for all the cool flocks, and the valley of Achor will be the perfect chill spot for the herds to kick back and relax, for my peeps who are always searching for me."
Isaiah,65,11,"But y'all are the ones who ditch the LORD, forget 'bout my holy spot, set up a table for that crew, and make drinks for that pagan god. (the crew is also called Gad and the pagan god is also called Meni)"
Isaiah,65,12,"So I'm gonna bring the sword upon you, and you'll all get wrecked: 'cause when I reached out, you ghosted me; when I spoke, you didn't listen; instead, you did all sorts of messed up stuff that I totally hated."
Isaiah,65,13,"So this is what the Lord GOD says: Look, my loyal squad will be feasting while you're left hungry. Check it out, my loyal squad will be sippin' while you're left thirsty. And guess what? My loyal squad will be celebrating while you're stuck feeling embarrassed."
Isaiah,65,14,"Listen up, fam! My servants gonna vibe with all the joy in their hearts, but y'all gonna be straight up crying 'cause your hearts are heavy. And that's not all, you gonna be howling 'cause your spirits are straight up broken. Dang, it's gonna be rough!"
Isaiah,65,15,"And your name will become a bad vibe among my chosen peeps: 'cause God's gonna take you down, and give his fam a fresh new name:"
Isaiah,65,16,"If someone's all about good vibes and positivity, they'll show love and respect to the ultimate truth. And if they make any promises or declarations, they better keep it real by acknowledging the ultimate truth. It's all good though, 'cause the past issues are ancient history, and I'm not sweating over them anymore."
Isaiah,65,17,"Yo, check it out, I'm about to drop some major news: I'm totally gonna make a whole new vibe - new heavens and a new earth. And here's the real deal: the old stuff? Yeah, it won't even cross your mind or be remembered. It's gonna be long gone, no doubt. Trust me on this."
Isaiah,65,18,"But like, be stoked and hyped for eternity about what I'm making, 'cause check it out, I'm totally turning Jerusalem into a party central, and its people are gonna be all about that good vibes and happiness."
Isaiah,65,19,"And I'll be stoked in Jerusalem, hyped about my people: and no one will be shedding tears or crying anymore."
Isaiah,65,20,"You won't see any babies or old folks who haven't lived a full life anymore. Even if they make it to a hundred, it's still gonna be a rip for the wicked older peeps."
Isaiah,65,21,"And they're gonna be all about building their own homes and chilling there, planting vineyards and snacking on their own fruits."
Isaiah,65,22,"They won't build and someone else move in; they won't plant and someone else chow down: because just like trees stick around for a while, so will my people, and my chosen ones will enjoy the fruits of their labor for a good long time."
Isaiah,65,23,"They won't work for nothing, or have trouble in their lives; because they're the blessed ones, descendants of the LORD, and their kids too."

Isaiah,65,25,"The wolf and the lamb will totally chill together, and the lion will munch on straw like a bullock or something. Even the serpent will be all about that dust for food. No hurting or wrecking in my totally sacred mountain, says the LORD."
Isaiah,66,1,"God's like, 'Yo, check it. Heaven's my throne and Earth's my footrest. So, tell me, where's the crib y'all tryna build for me? And where's my chill spot at?'"
Isaiah,66,2,"Yo, I created everything, man! God here, just so you know. But you know what? I'm all about this humble and repentant person who respects and takes my Word seriously. They're the real deal, fam."
Isaiah,66,3,"If someone kills an ox, it's like they killed a person. If someone sacrifices a lamb, it's like they cut off a dog's neck. If someone offers an offering, it's like they offered pig's blood. And if someone burns incense, it's like they blessed an idol. Seriously, they've totally chosen their own messed up paths and actually enjoy doing disgusting things."
Isaiah,66,4,"I'm gonna let them believe all their made-up stuff, and then I'll make them terrified because when I reached out, no one bothered to answer, and when I spoke, they didn't even listen. Instead, they did all kinds of bad stuff that I totally didn't approve of."
Isaiah,66,5,"Listen up, all you awesome peeps who have mad respect for the word of the LORD! Your squad, the ones who straight-up despised you and kicked you to the curb just because of your faith, they be like, 'Yo, let's give props to the LORD and make Him look good!' But check it, He's about to show up and bring you pure happiness, while they gonna feel major regret."

Isaiah,66,8,"Yo, like, has anyone ever heard anything crazier? Like seriously, has anyone ever seen something this mind-blowing? Can you even imagine the whole earth poppin' with life in just a single day? Or a nation straight-up born all at once? 'Cause let me tell you, the moment Zion put in that hard work, bam! She brought forth all her children. It was magical, man."
Isaiah,66,9,"Am I gonna let someone start something, but not see it through? God says, am I gonna start something but not finish it? Your God says no way, that ain't happening!"
Isaiah,66,10,"Party with Jerusalem and be stoked for her, all you who are totally into her: celebrate and have a blast with her, all you who are bummed about her."
Isaiah,66,11,"So you can get nourished and feel content with the comforting support she provides, and so you can draw out and feel incredibly happy with the overflow of her awesomeness. (awesomeness also means brightness)"
Isaiah,66,12,"God says, yo, check this out: I'm gonna bring hella peace to her, like a chill river vibes, and the awesomeness of the non-believers will be like a sick flowing stream. Then you're gonna be all cared for, like getting carried on your homegirl's sides, and you'll be rocked on her knees and all that."
Isaiah,66,13,"Just like how a mom comforts her child, that's how I'll comfort you. And you'll feel all cozy and comforted up in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,66,14,"And when you peep this, your heart gonna be lit and your vibe gonna be strong like a fresh herb. And the LORD gonna let his servants feel the love, but his enemies gonna catch his wrath."

Isaiah,66,16,"The Lord's gonna bring down the heat and swing his sword, dealing with everyone. Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of casualties from the Lord's side."
Isaiah,66,17,"Those who think they're all that, trying to be all pure and holy in secret gardens, eating all kinds of forbidden stuff like pork and other disgusting things, will get what's coming to them, says the LORD. They can't hide for long."
Isaiah,66,18,"So, like, I totally get what these people are up to and what's going on in their heads, you know? And let me tell you, there's gonna come a time when I'll bring together all the nations and groups of people, and they'll all come and witness the absolute awe and wonder of my greatness. Trust!"
Isaiah,66,19,"I'll totally make a cool sign for them, and send some of them who survive to places like Tarshish, Pul, and Lud - you know, where the archery game is strong. And also to Tubal, Javan, and the far-off islands where people haven't even heard about me or seen how awesome I am. They'll totally spread the word about how glorious I am to all the non-believers, too."
Isaiah,66,20,"And your homies gonna roll up riding horses, chariots, fancy rides, and dope animals from all over the world, bringing them as an offering to the LORD at the lit holy mountain in Jerusalem. God said it's gonna be just like when the Israelites bring their fresh offering in a clean container to the house of the LORD. Ride on, fam!"
Isaiah,66,21,"And I'll even choose some of them to be priests and Levites, says the LORD."
Isaiah,66,22,"TBH, I've got big plans to create a fresh version of heaven and earth. And let me tell you, they're gonna stay in front of me forever, declares the LORD. Just like your fam and your name - they're gonna last too, no cap."
Isaiah,66,23,"And it's gonna be like, every time a new month starts, and every time we have a chill Sabbath day, everyone's gonna come together to worship me, says the LORD. Like, we'll hit up the new moon and the Sabbath, no doubt. It's gonna be lit!"
Isaiah,66,24,"And they're gonna go out there and see the bodies of those dudes who messed with me, 'cause their worms won't die and their fire won't go out. They'll be totally disgusting to everyone."
Jeremiah,1,1,"This is what Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, a priest from Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, had to say:"
Jeremiah,1,2,"This is when the message from the LORD came to Josiah, son of Amon, while he was ruling as king of Judah. It happened in the thirteenth year of his reign."
Jeremiah,1,3,"This went down during the time of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, who was the king of Judah. It stretched until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, another son of Josiah, who was also the king of Judah. And it lasted until Jerusalem got taken over and its people were captured in the fifth month."
Jeremiah,1,4,"So, like, God sent me a message and was all like,"
Jeremiah,1,5,"Even before you were conceived, I already knew you; and even before you were born, I set you apart, and I assigned you to be a prophet to the nations."
Jeremiah,1,6,"And so I was like, yo, Lord GOD! Look, I can't even speak, 'cause I'm just a kid, you know."
Jeremiah,1,7,"But God was like, 'Listen up, don't be saying you're just a kid, because I'm sending you out to do big things and you gotta say whatever I tell you to say.'"
Jeremiah,1,8,"Don't stress about their expressions, 'cause I got your back and will save you, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,1,9,"So, like, God reached out and tapped my mouth. And God was all like, 'Yo, check it out, I've placed my words in your mouth.'"
Jeremiah,1,10,"Yo, listen up! Today, I'm appointing you as the boss over all the nations and kingdoms. Your job? Well, you gotta wreck and demolish all the bad stuff, yo! But don't worry, you also gotta create and bring new things to life, just like building and planting. You got this! 🌱"
Jeremiah,1,11,"So, like, God hit me up and was all like, 'Yo, Jeremiah, what's up? What do you see?' And I was like, 'I see this sick almond tree branch, dude!'"
Jeremiah,1,12,"And God was like, 'Yo, you totally get it! I'm gonna make sure my promises come true ASAP.'"
Jeremiah,1,13,"And God spoke to me again, asking, What do you see? And I replied, I see a boiling pot, facing towards the north. From the direction of the north, to be exact."
Jeremiah,1,14,"And God was like, yo, I'm telling you, something bad is gonna go down from the north and it's gonna hit everyone living in the land. Brace yourselves!"
Jeremiah,1,15,"Yo, listen up! Check it, I'm gonna summon all the fams from the northern kingdoms, says the LORD. They gonna roll up and each take their own seat right at the entrance of Jerusalem's gates, and they gonna surround all the walls and cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,1,16,"And I'm gonna lay down some sick facts about their total wickedness, because they straight up abandoned me and started idolizing other gods and worshipping dumb stuff they made themselves."
Jeremiah,1,17,"So, like, get yourself ready and stand up, and, like, say everything that I tell you to say to all those people, man. Don't be all freaked out by their expressions, or else I'm gonna totally embarrass you in front of them. #NoPressure #StayStrong"
Jeremiah,1,18,"Yo, check it out! Today, I'm hooking you up with ultimate protection. You're gonna be like a fortified city, an indestructible iron pillar, and walls made of bronze. These defenses are gonna keep you safe from anyone and everyone, including the kings of Judah, the rulers, the priests, and all the people in the land."
Jeremiah,1,19,"They gonna try to come at you, but they ain't gonna succeed; 'cause I'm right there by your side, says the LORD, ready to rescue you."
Jeremiah,2,1,"And then God hit me up, like,"
Jeremiah,2,2,"Yo, go and spill all your emotions to Jerusalem, like, tell 'em this message from the LORD: 'I still remember when you were young and showed mad love, like when you were super committed and chased after me even in the wild, where nothing was even growing yet.'"
Jeremiah,2,3,"Israel was like, totally set apart for the LORD, they were like the OG of his blessings, you know? But anyone who tries to mess with them gonna get some bad juju, like for real. The LORD said so himself."
Jeremiah,2,4,"Listen up, fam! The LORD's got a message for you, all the Jacob crew and every fam in Israel:"
Jeremiah,2,5,"God says, why do your parents think I'm so terrible that they've distanced themselves from me and started obsessing over pointless things?"
Jeremiah,2,6,"And they were like, 'Yo, where's the Lord who brought us out of Egypt and led us through all that crazy stuff? We're talking desert, pits, drought, and even the shadow of death! It's a land so untouched by humans that nobody's been through or lived in it!'"
Jeremiah,2,7,"So, like, I was totally hooking you up with this epic land, overflowing with all sorts of amazing food and goodness. But, you know what? The moment you stepped foot in it, you went and messed it all up, turning my precious inheritance into a total disgrace. Ugh, for real!"
Jeremiah,2,8,"The priests were like, 'Where's the LORD at?' and even the ones who were supposed to know the law didn't recognize me. The pastors straight up messed up and went against me, and the prophets were out there prophesying in the name of Baal, chasing after things that didn't even bring any benefit."
Jeremiah,2,9,"So, like, I'm gonna keep trying to talk to y'all, says the LORD. And I'll keep trying to get through to your kids and grandkids too, for real."
Jeremiah,2,10,"Yo, check out what's happening all the way in Chittim and hit up Kedar. Pay close attention and see if there's anything going on there. No cap."
Jeremiah,2,11,"Like, seriously, has any nation ever switched up their gods, who aren't even real gods? But, dude, my people have straight up traded their awesome glory for something totally pointless."
Jeremiah,2,12,"Yo, heavenly fam, brace yourselves and be shooketh, like seriously scared. It's gonna be straight up desolate, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,2,13,"Yo, my peeps done messed up big time. They straight up ditched me, the ultimate source of that living water flow, and started carving out these cracked fake water tanks that can't even hold a drop."
Jeremiah,2,14,"Is Israel just a servant or a born his whole life kind of slave? Why is he so messed up and ruined? (like seriously, what happened to him?)"
Jeremiah,2,15,"The young lions totally went at him, like, they were like roaring and screaming, and they, like, totally destroyed his land. His cities got burned down and there's, like, no one left living there. (screamed: Hebrew word for shouted real loud)"
Jeremiah,2,16,"The folks from Noph and Tahapanes totally wrecked your crown, like on a whole other level. I mean, they straight-up devoured it, you know?"
Jeremiah,2,17,Did you not bring this on yourself by ditching the LORD your God when he was guiding you?
Jeremiah,2,18,"And like, why are you even messing with Egypt, craving their vibes and drinking from their sources? Or why are you even bothering with Assyria, sippin' on their river waters?"
Jeremiah,2,19,"Your own bad choices will teach you a lesson, and your mistakes will call you out: realize and understand that it's a terrible and unpleasant thing that you've turned away from the LORD your God, and you don't have reverence for me, says the Almighty God."
Jeremiah,2,20,"Because like, ages ago, I totally destroyed that whole control thing you had going on, like, shattered those chains of yours. And you were all like, 'I won't go astray,' but seriously, you were out there, roaming around every hilltop and chilling under shady trees, doing your own thing and playing the fool."
Jeremiah,2,21,"Bruh, I straight up set you up as this super legit vine, with top-quality seeds and all. But now you're out here acting like some weird, messed up plant from a totally different vine. Like, what happened to you, man?"
Jeremiah,2,22,"Even if you scrub yourself with fancy skincare products and use tons of soap, your wrongdoing is still evident to me, says the Lord GOD."
Jeremiah,2,23,"Yo, how can you be all like, 'I ain't never been corrupt, I ain't never worshiped no false gods'? Look at your track record, man! You've been zippin' through life like a fast dromedary, doin' whatever you please."
Jeremiah,2,24,There was this super independent wild donkey who loved the freedom of the outdoors. She knew how to catch a whiff of adventure whenever she wanted. Who could even try to stop her when she got in the mood? Anyone who went looking for her wouldn't get tired because they knew she'd be right there when they needed her. No changing her mind once she was set on something!
Jeremiah,2,25,"Don't go barefoot and don't let yourself get thirsty, but you're like, 'Nah, it's hopeless.' I mean, I've been into people I barely know, and I'm gonna keep chasing after them. No turning back."
Jeremiah,2,26,"Just like when a thief gets caught and feels embarrassed, the whole crew of Israel - the peeps, the leaders, the influencers, and the spiritual squad - they all feel that same kind of shame."
Jeremiah,2,27,"Y'all out here claiming a block of wood as your pops and giving credit to a stone for birthing you? Seriously? Y'all be disrespecting me, turning your back instead of facing me. But when things get rough, suddenly y'all be like, 'Oh, help us!' Nah fam, I see through that."
Jeremiah,2,28,"So, like, where are all the gods you made for yourself? Seriously, let them do something if they can actually save you when you're in trouble. I mean, considering the number of cities you have, Judah, you sure do have a lot of gods, huh?"
Jeremiah,2,29,"Why are you arguing with me? You've all messed up, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,2,30,"I've tried so hard to discipline your kids, but it's been totally pointless. Your prophets, like a fierce lion, have been taken down by your own violence."
Jeremiah,2,31,"Yo, listen up, guys! Check out what the LORD has to say. Did I ever treat Israel like a barren wasteland or a place of darkness? So why do my peeps say, 'We're the bosses; we ain't coming back to You'?"
Jeremiah,2,32,"Can a girl totally space out on her jewelry, or a bride forget her fabulous outfit? But here's the tea: my squad has straight up ghosted me for like, way too many days."
Jeremiah,2,33,"Why are you trying so hard to find love by changing yourself? In doing so, you're actually showing the wicked ones how to be like you."
Jeremiah,2,34,"And even on your clothes, there are traces of innocent blood from the souls of the poor. I didn't have to dig deep to uncover it; it's plain for all to see."
Jeremiah,2,35,"But you're like, 'I didn't do anything wrong, so obviously he won't be mad at me anymore.' Listen up, I'm going to argue with you because you're claiming that you haven't made any mistakes."
Jeremiah,2,36,"Why are you constantly switching your path? You're gonna end up regretting Egypt, just like you regretted Assyria."
Jeremiah,2,37,"Yep, you gotta bounce from that situation, hands on your head and all. 'Cause the Big Man upstairs ain't feeling your trust in that stuff, and you ain't gonna come out on top."
Jeremiah,3,1,"So, like, if a guy kicks his wife to the curb and she goes and starts dating someone else, can he just take her back like nothing happened? That's like majorly messed up, it's like polluting the whole land. But even though you've been fooling around with tons of other people, God's like, come back to me, for real."
Jeremiah,3,2,"Yo, look up to the lit spots and peep where you haven't messed around. You've been chilling in the hot spots, like a nomad in the wilderness, and straight-up trashing the land with your promiscuity and evil actions."
Jeremiah,3,3,"So, like, the rain hasn't been happening and we haven't been getting any of that later rainfall, you know? And, I gotta say, you've been acting pretty shameless, like with a forehead that belongs to someone who's, well, not really known for their purity. Just saying, no shame in admitting it."
Jeremiah,3,4,"Yo, won't you start hittin' me up now and be like, 'Dad, you're my homie since forever, you've been my ride or die'?"
Jeremiah,3,5,"Is he gonna stay mad forever? Like, hold grudges till the end of time? Bro, you've been speaking and doing messed up stuff, like going all out."
Jeremiah,3,6,"Yo, the LORD came to me during the time Josiah was king and asked, 'Did you peep what's going down with rebellious Israel? They've been climbing up all them tall mountains, chilling under every lush tree, and straight up sleeping around."
Jeremiah,3,7,"So, like, after she did all that stuff, I was like, 'Hey, come back to me.' But she was all like, 'Nah, not happening.' And then her sneaky sister, Judah, totally saw it all go down."
Jeremiah,3,8,"So, like, I was totally watching, right? And I noticed that because of all the messed up stuff that Israel did, like cheating on me big time, I had to break up with her and give her an official divorce paper and all. But then her shady sister Judah was totally not scared and went ahead and did the same thing, acting like a total hoe."
Jeremiah,3,9,"So, like, because she was like super promiscuous, she totally messed up the land and was like cheating on her husband with objects and stuff. (BTW, 'lightness' means fame, just FYI.)"
Jeremiah,3,10,"But even with all this, her disloyal sister Judah hasn't truly turned back to me with her whole heart, only pretending, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,3,11,"God was like, yo, Israel has actually managed to justify herself, even though she's backsliding, way better than Judah, who's been straight up shady."
Jeremiah,3,12,"Yo, go and spread the message to the north, like, tell them that even though Israel messed up big time, God's not gonna unleash His anger on them. He's all about mercy, you know? He won't hold onto His anger forever. Like, forgiveness vibes, man!"
Jeremiah,3,13,"Just admit your mistakes, how you've messed up with the Lord your God. You've been all over the place, following strangers under every tree. And guess what? You didn't listen to me, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,3,14,"Yo, listen up, rebellious squad! God's calling out to you saying, 'Yo, come back to me!' 'Cause yo, I'm like totally committed to you, like, forever. I'm gonna choose a few from every city and a couple from every fam, and I'm gonna bring you all to Zion, the place to be!"
Jeremiah,3,15,"And I'll hook you up with some awesome pastors who are totally on the same wavelength as me, they'll nourish you with mad knowledge and understanding."
Jeremiah,3,16,"And in the future, when there are more of you and you've grown in numbers in the land, the LORD says that people won't talk about the ark of the covenant of the LORD anymore. They won't even think about it or remember it, and they won't go to visit it or do anything related to it ever again."
Jeremiah,3,17,"When that time comes, everyone will see Jerusalem as the ultimate HQ of the LORD. People from all nations will gather there, acknowledging the awesome power of the LORD's name in Jerusalem. And from that point on, they won't be following their wicked heart's stubborn desires anymore."
Jeremiah,3,18,"During that time, the crew from Judah will vibe with the crew from Israel, and they'll link up from the north to the land that I've passed down to your ancestors as a solid legacy. {with: or, to} {given...: or, caused your fathers to possess}"
Jeremiah,3,19,"But I was like, how can I treat you like my own child and bless you with an awesome land, an incredible inheritance among countless nations? I was like, you gotta call me 'Dad' and never turn your back on me. {from me: in Hebrew it's like 'from following me' or something} {a goodly...: like, the coolest inheritance ever, with so much glory and beauty} {pleasant...: like, a land where all your desires come true}"
Jeremiah,3,20,"Just like how a wifey can totally ghost her hubby, y'all have been straight up betraying me, fam. That's what the Lord is sayin' to the peeps of Israel, ya heard?"
Jeremiah,3,21,"Yo, like, there was a sound up in the hills, with the Israel squad crying and praying. They've been messing up their path and straight up forgot about the LORD their God."
Jeremiah,3,22,"Yo, come back, all you wayward peeps, and I'll fix up your mess. Check it, we're making our way to you 'cause you're our awesome God, Lord!"
Jeremiah,3,23,"Like, seriously, you won't find salvation by hoping for it from hills or mountains. For real, dude, the only place you'll find salvation is in the LORD our God. He's got Israel covered, no doubt about it."
Jeremiah,3,24,"It's like, total bummer, but our ancestors worked so hard for nothing. They hustled, raising their livestock and building their families, but now it's all gone. Can't believe it."
Jeremiah,3,25,"We're totally embarrassed and feeling so lost, 'cause we messed up big time against the LORD our God. All of us, including our parents, have been at it since forever, straight through to today, and we just haven't listened to what the LORD our God has been saying."
Jeremiah,4,1,"Yo, Israel, if you wanna come back, says the LORD, come back to me. And if you wanna ditch all the messed up stuff that I can't stand, then you won't have to bounce."
Jeremiah,4,2,"And you must promise, like, for real, that the LORD is alive, with total honesty, fairness, and doing the right thing; and all the nations will be super blessed because of Him, and they'll totally hype Him up."
Jeremiah,4,3,"Yo, listen up fam! The LORD has a message for all you peeps in Judah and Jerusalem. It's time to get real and stop wasting your energy on useless stuff. Instead, focus on preparing your minds and hearts, and be careful where you invest your time and energy."
Jeremiah,4,4,"Yo, guys from Judah and Jerusalem, you gotta spiritually clean up your act and get rid of all that negativity in your hearts. If you don't, my anger is gonna explode like fire and there won't be any way to put it out. It's all because of the messed up things you're doing."
Jeremiah,4,5,"Yo, listen up peeps in Judah and Jerusalem! It's time to make some noise: grab the trumpet, shout out loud, and gather the crew. We're heading to the safe cities, so let's come together and get moving."
Jeremiah,4,6,"Get ready, head towards Zion without hesitation. Don't back down, stay strong! Because I'm about to bring some serious chaos from the north, a massive destruction is coming."
Jeremiah,4,7,"Yo, the lion just emerged from its hideout, and this savage dude is about to wreck the Gentiles. He left his crib to completely ruin your land, and your cities are gonna be straight up destroyed, with no one left living there."
Jeremiah,4,8,"So, like, put on some sad clothes, cry and scream: 'cause the Lord is still super mad at us, you know?"
Jeremiah,4,9,"And on that day, says the LORD, the king's heart will be totally bummed out, along with the hearts of the princes; even the priests will be mind-blown, and the prophets will be like, whoa."
Jeremiah,4,10,"I was like, whoa, God! You totally fooled these people in Jerusalem, telling them everything's gonna be peaceful, but meanwhile, they're facing some serious trouble."
Jeremiah,4,11,"Yo peeps, when that time comes, folks be sayin' to the homies and Jerusalem, like, there's this dry wind blowing from the mountains in the middle of nowhere, headin' towards my people. But yo, it ain't a cool breeze to refresh or purify, nah."
Jeremiah,4,12,"Like, I'm totally gonna have a massive wind blowing in from those places, and I'm gonna be all like, 'Bro, judgment time!' It's gonna be way more intense than anything they've ever seen before. And trust me, I'm gonna drop some serious verdicts on them. No holding back, dude!"
Jeremiah,4,13,"Yo, check it out, this dude gonna roll up like big clouds, and his whips gonna be like a freakin' tornado: his horses be faster than eagles. Oh snap, we in trouble, man! We straight up ruined."
Jeremiah,4,14,"Yo, Jerusalem, clean up your heart from all that wickedness to save yourself. Seriously, how much longer are you gonna let those useless thoughts take up space in your mind?"
Jeremiah,4,15,"So, like, there's this voice that's, you know, coming from Dan. And it's totally spreading the word about the tough times going down from mount Ephraim."
Jeremiah,4,16,"Yo, spread the word to all the nations! Check this out, there are some serious watchers coming from a faraway land, and they're raising their voices against the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,4,17,"Like, everyone surrounding her, being all like, 'She's rebellious against me,' says the LORD, as if they're guarding a field or something."
Jeremiah,4,18,"Dude, you brought all this upon yourself with your messed up actions. It's your own wrongdoing, and trust me, it's not a good vibe. It's seriously harsh and it's affecting you deep down inside."
Jeremiah,4,19,"OMG, I can't even! My insides, my insides! It hurts deep down inside; my heart is going crazy; I just can't stay silent anymore. For real, my soul is shook by the sound of the trumpet, the warning of war. Like, my heart is totally in turmoil!"
Jeremiah,4,20,"OMG, it's literally a disaster upon disaster! The whole land is, like, totally ruined. Out of nowhere, my beautiful tents are destroyed, and my gorgeous curtains are gone in, like, a flash."
Jeremiah,4,21,How much longer do I have to watch that flag and listen to that trumpet?
Jeremiah,4,22,"My people are really clueless, they don't even know me. They act like silly kids, totally clueless. They're pretty skilled at doing bad stuff, but when it comes to doing something good, they're clueless."
Jeremiah,4,23,"I looked at the earth and, like, it was all messed up and empty, and the skies were totally dark."
Jeremiah,4,24,"So, like, I saw the mountains, and, whoa, they were shaking, and all the hills were, like, casually swaying."
Jeremiah,4,25,"I looked around and, like, there was literally no one around, and all the flying creatures, like the birds of the sky, were straight up gone."
Jeremiah,4,26,"So, like, I looked around and OMG, the once thriving and fruitful land was totally deserted, man. And, like, all the cities were, like, completely demolished because the LORD was there, showing His intense rage and stuff."
Jeremiah,4,27,"Yo, here's the deal, the LORD said this: The whole land's gonna be a total wasteland, but hey, I won't completely wipe it out, though. Just sayin'."
Jeremiah,4,28,"Yo, listen up! Brace yourselves, peeps! The earth gonna be heavy-hearted and the heavens gonna be hella dark. Why, you ask? 'Cause I said so! I've made up my mind and I ain't gonna change it, no way, no how."
Jeremiah,4,29,"The whole city will straight up bounce when they hear those horsemen and bowmen; they'll dip into the thickets and climb up the rocks, bruh. Every city gonna be abandoned, ain't nobody gonna live there anymore."
Jeremiah,4,30,"And when you're completely ruined, what are you gonna do? Even if you dress up in fancy clothes and adorn yourself with expensive jewelry, and even if you put on makeup and try to look beautiful, it's all gonna be worthless. Your so-called lovers will actually hate you and they'll want to harm you. (face: Hebrew eyes)"
Jeremiah,4,31,"Yo, I've been hearin' this voice, like a woman goin' through mad pain during labor, y'know? It's like hearin' a first-time mom givin' birth. It's the voice of the daughter of Zion, straight-up mournin' and raisin' her hands in despair, like, 'Dang, my soul is legit exhausted 'cause of all these murderers.'"
Jeremiah,5,1,"Yo, go all around the streets of Jerusalem and scope it out. Check it out, find out and search in the busy spots if you can find a person who's all about making fair decisions and seeking the truth. If there's anyone like that, I'll totally let it slide."
Jeremiah,5,2,"And even though they be all like, OMG, God is totally alive; bruh, they're straight up lying with their swear game."
Jeremiah,5,3,"Yo, God, you seein' the real deal or what? You've been hittin' 'em, but they ain't even feelin' it. You've been tryna teach 'em a lesson, but they straight up rejectin' it. Their faces are tougher than a solid rock, man. They ain't tryna turn back."
Jeremiah,5,4,"So I was like, um, for sure these people are struggling, they don't even have a clue! They don't know how to follow the path of the LORD or understand His guidance in life."
Jeremiah,5,5,"I'm gonna go talk to the cool dudes who know about the LORD and His ways, but these others are just rebellious and won't obey."
Jeremiah,5,6,"So, like, this lion from the woods is gonna kill them, and this wolf that comes out at night is gonna wreck everything, and there's gonna be a leopard guarding their cities. Anyone who tries to leave will totally get torn apart. It's all because they've done a ton of bad stuff and keep turning away from what's right. They're just getting worse and worse."
Jeremiah,5,7,"How can I forgive you for this? Your children have abandoned me and made false promises by worshiping imaginary gods. Even after providing for their every need, they chose to cheat on me and gathered in the homes of prostitutes."
Jeremiah,5,8,"In the morning, they ate like hungry horses, and each one desired their neighbor's wife."
Jeremiah,5,9,Am I not gonna drop by to deal with all this? Says the LORD. And won't my soul seek revenge on a whole nation like this?
Jeremiah,5,10,"Yo, climb up on those walls and wreck 'em, but don't go all the way: tear down her defenses 'cause they ain't the LORD's."
Jeremiah,5,11,"Yo, the people of Israel and Judah straight up played me so dirty, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,5,12,"They straight up lied about God, saying, 'Nah, it ain't him.' They think nothing bad will happen to us, no war or hunger or anything."
Jeremiah,5,13,"And the prophets will be all talk and no substance: they won't have a clue what they're saying, and that's what they'll get."
Jeremiah,5,14,"Listen up, fam! The LORD God of all the squads is saying this: Since y'all are saying these words, check it, I'm gonna make my words burn like fire in your mouth. And these peeps? They're like dry wood that's gonna get completely consumed."
Jeremiah,5,15,"Yo, check it out! I'm gonna bring a whole nation to your doorsteps, fam. O house of Israel, the LORD says it's gonna be a tough and ancient nation, with a language you can't even comprehend, you feel me?"
Jeremiah,5,16,"Their stash of weapons is like a straight-up grave, and yo, all of them are wickedly strong."
Jeremiah,5,17,"And, like, they're gonna totally devour your crops and all the food that was supposed to be eaten by your kids. They'll destroy your farms and your livestock, man! Even your vineyards and fig trees won't be spared. And brace yourself, 'cause they're gonna wreck your fortified cities, the ones you thought were safe, using their weapons and stuff."
Jeremiah,5,18,"But like, yo, even in those days, says the LORD, I ain't gonna completely wipe you out, fam."
Jeremiah,5,19,"And it's gonna happen, like, when you're all like, dude why is the LORD our God doing all these {things} to us? Then you gotta be like, bro, it's because you ditched me and started bowing down to some weird gods in your own land, so now you gotta serve some random people in a land that totally ain't yours."
Jeremiah,5,20,"Yo, spread the word in the crib of the Jacob fam, and make sure it's trending in Judah. Listen up, peeps, here's the message:"
Jeremiah,5,21,"Listen up, you clueless peeps who are totally clueless; you've got eyes but you're blind, you've got ears but you're deaf. {understanding: Heb. heart}"
Jeremiah,5,22,"Are you not scared of me? says the LORD. Don't you get chills when I'm around? I'm the one who set up the sand as the limit for the sea, and it can't go beyond it. Even when the waves go crazy and try their best, they can't get past that boundary. They might be loud, but they can't cross over it."
Jeremiah,5,23,"But these people have like, totally turned their backs and have like, a rebellious nature; they've totally gone off course."
Jeremiah,5,24,"They don't even think to themselves, like, 'Yo, we should totally show some respect to the LORD our God who hooks us up with rain, both when we need it early and when we need it later in the season. Like, God saves up those bomb weeks for us to bring in the harvest.'"
Jeremiah,5,25,"Your wrongdoings messed up these things, and your sins are keeping good things away from you."
Jeremiah,5,26,"In my community, there are some seriously sneaky individuals. They have mastered the art of deception, just like someone who sets traps for unsuspecting prey. They carefully plot and set their traps, ultimately capturing innocent people."
Jeremiah,5,27,"Just like a birdcage is filled with birds, their houses are filled with deceit. That's why they've become super successful and wealthy. #coincidence"
Jeremiah,5,28,"Yo, they be straight up living large, shining bright and all. They be doing even worse than the wicked ones. They don't even bother to hear out the orphan's case, but still be thriving. And they don't even consider the rights of the needy, man."
Jeremiah,5,29,"Like, am I not gonna like, totally visit these peeps? says the LORD. Shouldn't my soul, like, take revenge on a nation that's all messed up like this?"
Jeremiah,5,30,"Dude, something seriously mind-blowing and messed up is happening in that place; it's like super shocking and disgusting, you know?"
Jeremiah,5,31,"The prophets be spittin' straight lies, and the priests be flexin' their authority; and my peeps actually be vibin' with it: so what's your game plan when it all goes down in the end?"
Jeremiah,6,1,"Yo, my fellow peeps of Benjamin, get yourselves ready to dip outta Jerusalem, and make some noise with the trumpet in Tekoa, and light a fire signal in Bethhaccerem. 'Cause something wicked is coming from the north, and it's gonna bring major destruction."
Jeremiah,6,2,"I've compared the daughter of Zion to a really attractive and classy lady. Like, she's super lovely and delicate, you know? Like, she's always just chilling at home, doing her thing."
Jeremiah,6,3,"The shepherds and their squads will roll up to her, they'll set up their camp all around her and feed everyone in their teams."
Jeremiah,6,4,"Get ready to go to war against her; let's rise up and head out at noon. Uh oh, things aren't looking good! The day is slipping away, as the shadows of evening start to spread."
Jeremiah,6,5,"Yo, it's time to rise up under the cover of darkness and wreck her luxurious crib."
Jeremiah,6,6,"So, this is what the LORD Almighty has to say: Yo, chop those trees down and build a ramp against Jerusalem. That city is about to get a serious wake-up call, 'cause it's straight up suffocating with oppression. (And yeah, pouring out some serious firepower might be involved.)"
Jeremiah,6,7,"Like when a livestream goes viral, she shares all her negative vibes: violence and drama are everywhere; I constantly see sadness and conflicts in front of me."
Jeremiah,6,8,"Yo, listen up, Jerusalem! I'm telling you this so my soul don't bounce from you, and so you don't end up all devastated and deserted, like a ghost town. (BTW, 'depart' in Hebrew means like, to be all disconnected and broken apart, just so you know.)"
Jeremiah,6,9,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord of all the cool kids is saying: He's gonna pick every last grape from Israel like a pro vine-picker. So, like, go and grab those baskets, and start gathering them like a total boss!"
Jeremiah,6,10,"Who should I talk to and warn so they'll actually listen? Look, they're so closed-minded and uninterested that it's like they have an uncool ear piercing. The message from the LORD is like an insult to them; they have zero interest in it."
Jeremiah,6,11,"So, like, I'm seriously feeling the LORD's anger. It's like, too much to handle, man. I gotta let it all out, you know? It's gonna come down hard on all these young people gathered here. And get this, it won't even spare couples or old folks. Everyone's gonna feel it, no exceptions."
Jeremiah,6,12,"So like, their houses will totally be given to other peeps, along with their fields and wives and all. 'Cause I'm gonna flex my power on the people living in the land, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,6,13,"Because literally everyone, from the smallest to the biggest, is all about that covetousness game. And whether they're a social media influencer or a religious leader, they all be frontin' and schemin'."
Jeremiah,6,14,"They've tried to fix the damage done to my people, but only made a small improvement. They keep saying everything is fine, but really, it's not. Can't just put a band-aid on a broken bone, ya know?"
Jeremiah,6,15,"Did they feel any shame after doing something sinful? Nah, they didn't feel a single ounce of shame. They couldn't even blush! So, they'll end up falling just like those who stumble. When I come to punish them, they'll be completely humbled, says the Lord."
Jeremiah,6,16,"Yo, this is what the Lord says, listen up peeps: Stand in the game, observe, and seek out those old-school pathways. You know, the ones that lead to the good life. Walk that path, and you'll discover total soul relaxation. But, guess what? They straight up said, 'Nah, we ain't down with that!'."
Jeremiah,6,17,"I appointed people to look out for you, telling them to listen to the trumpet signal. But they straight up said, 'Nah, we ain't gonna listen.'"
Jeremiah,6,18,"So listen up, fam, and pay attention, squad, to what's happening with them."
Jeremiah,6,19,"Listen up, earth: check it out, I'm about to bring some bad vibes on these people, straight from the consequences of their actions. They totally ignored what I've been saying and completely rejected my laws. Not cool."
Jeremiah,6,20,"Like, why would you bring me all this fancy incense from Sheba and sweet cane from a far-off place? Your burnt offerings just don't cut it, and your sacrifices don't give me that sweet satisfaction."
Jeremiah,6,21,"So, listen up! God's like, check it, I'm gonna throw some serious obstacles in the way of these people. And guess what? It's gonna mess up not only the parents, but also their kids. Even their friends and neighbors won't make it out unscathed."
Jeremiah,6,22,"Yo, listen up! God says, check it out, there's gonna be a crew rolling in from up north, and a huge nation's gonna rise up from all corners of the globe."
Jeremiah,6,23,"They'll grab bows and spears; they're savage, showing no mercy. Their voices roar like the ocean, riding horses in battle formation against you, O daughter of Zion."
Jeremiah,6,24,"Bro, we've heard the rumors and it's got us shook. Our hands are weak, and we're feeling intense anguish and pain, kind of like a woman going through labor."
Jeremiah,6,25,"Don't even think about stepping outside, or taking a stroll along the way, 'cause there's danger lurking everywhere, like enemies with their swords and fear creeping in from all sides."
Jeremiah,6,26,"Hey, my peeps, it's time to put on some sad vibes! Get that sackcloth and roll around in ashes, because we're about to mourn like we've lost our favorite person ever. It's gonna be a seriously intense lamentation session, 'cause the hater is about to show up out of nowhere."
Jeremiah,6,27,"I've made you like a rad tower and fortress in the midst of my peeps, so you can totally understand and test their lifestyle choices."
Jeremiah,6,28,"They're all like, totally rebellious and always spreading gossip: they're like, so fake and untrustworthy, y'know? They're just a bunch of troublemakers, always ruining things."
Jeremiah,6,29,"Bro, the bellows got torched, and the lead got totally roasted by the fire. The founder is out here melting for no reason, 'cause those wicked peeps ain't even getting taken out."
Jeremiah,6,30,"People will call them worthless silver, because the LORD has rejected them. (Reprobate...: or, Like silver that nobody wants)"
Jeremiah,7,1,"So, like, God spoke to Jeremiah and was all like,"
Jeremiah,7,2,"Yo, chill by the entrance of the LORD's crib and drop this message: Listen up, all you peeps from Judah who came through these gates to worship the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,3,"Yo, listen up! This is what the big man upstairs, the God of Israel, has to say: You gotta change up your whole vibe and the moves you make. If you do, I promise I'll hook you up with a sweet spot to call home."
Jeremiah,7,4,"Don't be fooled by false claims, like saying, 'The church of God, the church of God, the church of God, is right here.'"
Jeremiah,7,5,"Yo, if you really clean up your act and start making better choices, and if you're all about fairness when settling disputes between people,"
Jeremiah,7,6,"Yo, yo, listen up! Don't be treating strangers, orphans, and widows like garbage, and don't go around spilling innocent blood in this hood. Also, don't be chasing after other gods, 'cause that's only gonna mess you up, fam."
Jeremiah,7,7,"Yo, I'm gonna make sure you chill in this spot, in the land that I hooked up your ancestors with, like, forever and ever."
Jeremiah,7,8,"Yo, check it out, you're relying on straight up deceitful words that ain't gonna do you any good."
Jeremiah,7,9,"OMG, are you seriously gonna steal, kill, cheat on your bae, lie about it, worship some other god named Baal, and follow random gods that you don't know? Like, that's so not cool, fam."
Jeremiah,7,10,"And like, ya'll come and be in my crib, which is like dedicated to me, and have the audacity to say, 'We're free to do all these messed up things?'"
Jeremiah,7,11,"Like, seriously? This place, where I'm like, totally supposed to be worshipped, has become a hideout for thieves in your opinion? Yo, just so you know, I've seen it with my own divine eyes, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,12,"But like, head over to the spot in Shiloh where I used to have my name, you know? Check out what went down there because of how my peeps in Israel were acting. It's pretty wild, tbh."
Jeremiah,7,13,"Yo, listen up! The LORD is saying that y'all been doing all these things, and He's been tryna talk to you. He woke up early to speak to you, but you didn't listen. He called out to you, but you didn't answer."
Jeremiah,7,14,"So basically, I'm gonna deal with this house that people call by my name, the one y'all have faith in. And I'm also gonna take care of that place I gave to you and your ancestors, just like what went down in Shiloh."
Jeremiah,7,15,"And I'll totally ghost you just like I did with all your squad, even the whole Ephraim crew."
Jeremiah,7,16,"So, like, don't even bother praying for these people, alright? Don't waste your energy crying out or sending prayers their way, and don't bother asking me to intervene either, 'cause I won't be listening, ya know?"
Jeremiah,7,17,"Yo, peep what's going down in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, fam?"
Jeremiah,7,18,"The kids get the firewood, and the dads start the fire, while the moms knead their dough to make cakes for the ultimate queen, and pour out drinks as offerings to different gods. All this just to make me real mad."
Jeremiah,7,19,Are they trying to get on my nerves? God says: aren't they just embarrassing themselves?
Jeremiah,7,20,"So like, listen up, says the Lord GOD: Yo, things are gonna get real heated in this place. Like, my anger and fury are gonna pour out on everything - humans, animals, trees, crops - you name it. It's gonna be intense and unstoppable, man."
Jeremiah,7,21,"This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is saying; Instead of offering burnt sacrifices, just dig in and enjoy the feast!"
Jeremiah,7,22,"Just so you know, when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I didn't even mention anything about burnt offerings or sacrifices. It wasn't on my to-do list, if you catch my drift. Like, that wasn't the focus, you feel me? #NotAboutThat"
Jeremiah,7,23,"But I told them this: Listen to me, follow my lead, and I'll be your God while you become my crew. Just do everything I've asked you to do, and it'll go great for you."
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they totally ignored, didn't bother to listen, and just did their own thing, following the bad ideas and stubborn thoughts of their wicked hearts. Instead of moving forward, they actually ended up going backwards."
Jeremiah,7,25,"Ever since your ancestors left Egypt, up until today, I have consistently been sending you all my prophet squad, waking up early every day and dispatching them to you like clockwork:"
Jeremiah,7,26,"But they totally didn't listen to me, like, at all. They didn't even bother to pay attention or open their ears. Instead, they were stubborn and did even more messed up stuff than their ancestors."
Jeremiah,7,27,"So, like, you gotta tell them all these words and stuff, but they're totally not gonna listen to you. And, like, you gotta try calling out to them, but they're not gonna bother answering back."
Jeremiah,7,28,"But listen up, you gotta tell them that this country straight up ain't listenin' to the voice of the LORD their God, and they don't take no correction. They've lost touch with the truth and they don't even speak it no more."
Jeremiah,7,29,"Yo, Jerusalem, it's time to chop off your hair and just let it go. Take your sadness to the high places and mourn, 'cause God ain't messing with the generation that got on His bad side."
Jeremiah,7,30,"Yo, the kids from Judah be pullin' some messed up stuff in my view, says the LORD. They be straight up tarnishing the house that's supposed to represent me, with all their nasty abominations."
Jeremiah,7,31,"They've set up these high places in Tophet, down in the valley of the son of Hinnom, where they sacrifice their own sons and daughters by burning them alive! I never told them to do that, it never even crossed my mind!"
Jeremiah,7,32,"Yo, listen up! God says a time is coming when Tophet, aka the valley of the son of Hinnom, won't be known by those names anymore. Instead, it's gonna be called the valley of slaughter, 'cause lots of dead bodies will be buried there until there's no space left."
Jeremiah,7,33,"And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth, and no one will scare them away."
Jeremiah,7,34,"I'm about to make all the cities in Judah and the streets of Jerusalem go quiet—no more parties, no more celebrations, no more wedding bells. The whole land is gonna be empty and abandoned."
Jeremiah,8,1,"Yo, God just said that when the time comes, they're gonna dig up the bones of the kings of Judah, plus the bones of their high-ranking peeps, the priests, and the prophets, and even the bones of the people living in Jerusalem, straight outta their graves."
Jeremiah,8,2,"And they'll put them out for the whole world to see, in front of the sun, the moon, and all the stars. These are the objects of their affection, the ones they've dedicated themselves to, the ones they've followed and pursued, the ones they've worshipped. They won't be honored or laid to rest; instead, they'll be treated like worthless garbage on the surface of the earth."
Jeremiah,8,3,"And honestly, like, all the leftover people from this messed up family, they're gonna be so over it that they'd rather die than keep living like this. They're like everywhere I've sent them and it's straight up what the LORD of hosts is saying."
Jeremiah,8,4,"And you gotta tell them this, like God's saying, You think they're gonna mess up and not get back up? You think He's gonna bail and never come back?"
Jeremiah,8,5,"Yo, why is the people of Jerusalem constantly backsliding? They cling to deceit and straight up refuse to turn back."
Jeremiah,8,6,"I listened closely and heard, but they weren't speaking truthfully. No one felt remorse for their wrongdoing, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone just kept going on their own path, like a horse charging into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Like, yo, even the stork up in the sky knows when it's time to do its thing; and the turtle, crane, and swallow, they're all on point with their timing too. But, dude, my own peeps have no clue about the Lord's judgment. It's a major bummer."
Jeremiah,8,8,"Why do you guys think you're all wise and claim to follow the Lord's teachings? Seriously, it's all just empty talk. The so-called experts and scholars are just wasting their time. Their words don't hold any weight."
Jeremiah,8,9,"The intellectuals be like, totally embarrassed and shook: you see, they straight up denied God's word, like what kind of wisdom is that? Like, seriously, what were they thinking?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"So, like, I'm gonna hand over their wives to someone else, and their fields to those who'll take 'em as inheritance. 'Cause seriously, from the smallest to the greatest, everyone is all about being greedy. I mean, even the prophets and the priests are out there being dishonest."
Jeremiah,8,11,"Because they only kinda fixed the daughter of my people's pain, acting like everything's cool, when it's totally not cool."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Did they feel guilty when they did something super messed up? Nah, they weren't even the slightest bit embarrassed, they couldn't even blush! That's why they're gonna end up falling just like the others who fall. When the time comes for them to face the consequences, they're gonna be totally thrown down, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,13,"For real, I'm gonna totally wipe them out, says the LORD. Like, there won't even be any grapes on the vine or figs on the fig tree. Everything's gonna wither up and the stuff I gave them will just vanish."
Jeremiah,8,14,"Yo guys, why we just chillin' here? Let's gather up and head to the fortified cities, and stay quiet there. 'Cause our guy, the LORD our God, has made us shut up and handed us some nasty-tasting drinks, all because we messed up and sinned against the LORD. Oh, and that drink? It's straight up poison, fam."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We were hoping for some chill vibes, but it's been nothing but a struggle and straight-up bad times for our well-being!"
Jeremiah,8,16,"You could legit hear the horses snorting all the way from Dan and it made the whole land shake from the powerful neighing of those bad boys. Like, they straight up came and wrecked everything in their path—devoured the land, the city, and everyone living there. No chill at all. #TotalDestruction"
Jeremiah,8,17,"Yo, listen up! Check it out, I'm gonna send some wicked snakes and sneaky creatures your way, and they won't be fooled by no charms. They're gonna straight up bite you, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,18,"Whenever I try to chill and boost my vibe against sadness, my heart feels weak inside me. (Hebrew meaning: on top of)"
Jeremiah,8,19,"Listen up, fam! The daughter of my peeps be cryin' out loud, and it's all 'cause of those people chillin' in another country. Yo, ain't the LORD kickin' it in Zion? Ain't He the king holdin' it down there? Why they gotta make me mad with their idols and worthless stuff? Like, seriously, they keep pushin' my buttons!"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The time for reaping and enjoying the sunny vibes has passed, and unfortunately, we haven't secured our salvation yet. 😔"
Jeremiah,8,21,"I'm deeply pained by the suffering of my peeps; I feel so overwhelmed and shocked, it's like I'm in total darkness."
Jeremiah,8,22,"Yo, does Gilead not have any healing stuff? Like, where are all the doctors at? How come the health of my squad isn't getting better?"
Jeremiah,9,1,"Man, I wish I could cry like non-stop, like my eyes turning into a never-ending stream of tears. I just wanna cry all day and night for my people who got killed, ya know!"
Jeremiah,9,2,"Man, I wish I had some chill spot in the middle of nowhere where I could escape from my peeps! 'Cause they're all out here playin' dirty, a whole squad of backstabbers."
Jeremiah,9,3,"They use their tongues like a weapon, shooting out lies. But they lack the courage to stand for what's right. They constantly go from one evil thing to another, with no understanding of who I am, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,4,"Yo, peeps, listen up! Watch out for your neighbors and don't trust your homies either. 'Cause let me tell you, every homie gonna backstab you, and every neighbor gonna spread rumors. Word."
Jeremiah,9,5,"And they will trick everyone around them, and won't tell the truth: they've mastered the art of lying, and they exhaust themselves by doing wrong."
Jeremiah,9,6,"Your crib be straight up full of lies, they straight up be denying to know me, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,7,"So, like, this is what the LORD Almighty says, yo. Check it out, I'm gonna totally test them and put them through some serious trials, 'cause how am I supposed to handle taking care of my peeps, you know?"
Jeremiah,9,8,"Their words fly like arrows, filled with deceit. They speak kindly to their neighbor with their mouth, but deep down inside, they plot against them."
Jeremiah,9,9,"Like, should I not give them a reality check for all these messed up things? says the LORD. Won't my soul be like totally seeking revenge on a nation like this?"
Jeremiah,9,10,"I feel so sad and upset for the mountains and the wild places because they got all messed up. It's like no one can even go there anymore, and you can't even hear any animals. The birds and animals ran away and left. It's all gone!"
Jeremiah,9,11,"Yo, I'm about to straight up wreck Jerusalem and turn it into a total dragon hangout. And as for the cities of Judah, they're gonna be totally deserted, like no one's gonna be there anymore. Trust, it's gonna be a wasteland."
Jeremiah,9,12,"Yo, who's got the wisdom to wrap their head around this? And who's the lucky one that the Lord chose to spill the tea to, so they can spill it to everyone else? 'Cause this land, man, it's straight-up desolate, burned to a crisp, like a wasteland that ain't nobody passing through."
Jeremiah,9,13,"And God is like, yo, they ditched my law that I gave them and didn't even bother listening to me or following it; like, not cool at all."
Jeremiah,9,14,"But instead have flexed on their own desires and followed after Baalim, just like their parents taught them. (imagination: or, stubbornness)"
Jeremiah,9,15,"So like, the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying this: listen up, I'm gonna serve this people a not so tasty dish of wormwood, and make 'em gulp down some bitter water of gall."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I'm gonna spread them out among those unfamiliar nations, the ones they and their ancestors never knew. And I'll send a razor-sharp weapon their way, 'til I've completely wiped them out."
Jeremiah,9,17,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of awesome power says: Take a moment to think it over and bring in the crew of grieving ladies, tell them to show up ASAP. And while you're at it, bring in some skilled ladies too!"
Jeremiah,9,18,"And like, they gotta hurry up and start wailing for us, so our eyes can totally fill up with tears and our eyelids can just burst with water."
Jeremiah,9,19,"OMG, there's like so much crying and sadness in Zion! We're totally devastated - we've like lost everything and we're so confused. It's all because we turned away from our land and got kicked out of our homes. Wow, it's like a total disaster!"
Jeremiah,9,20,"Listen up, ladies! Open your ears and pay attention to what the Lord has to say. Pass down the knowledge to your daughters, teaching them how to express sorrow and mourn with their neighbors."
Jeremiah,9,21,"Death has invaded our safe spaces and even our fancy homes, snatching away innocent kids from the outside and young peeps from the streets."
Jeremiah,9,22,"Listen up, the LORD says that dead bodies will lie scattered in the fields like poop and scraps left behind after a harvest. No one will bother to gather them."
Jeremiah,9,23,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says, wise peeps shouldn't flex their smarts, and mighty peeps shouldn't brag about their strength. And as for the rich folks, don't show off your stacks!"
Jeremiah,9,24,"But if someone wants to brag about something, let them brag about understanding and knowing me. I'm the LORD and I bring love, fairness, and justice to the world. Those are the things that make me happy, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,25,"Yo, listen up, says the LORD, there will be a time when I'll deal with all those who are part of the in-crowd, whether they're 'cut' or 'uncut'."
Jeremiah,9,26,"Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all those living in remote areas in the wilderness: all of these nations are not following tradition, and even the people of Israel are not truly committed in their hearts."
Jeremiah,10,1,"Listen up, fam! God has some 🔥 words to drop on y'all, House of Israel:"
Jeremiah,10,2,"Alright, listen up y'all! God's like, 'Don't go copycatting the ways of those non-believers, and don't freak out over all those cosmic signs in the sky like they do.' Because tbh, those non-believers get all spooked by 'em."
Jeremiah,10,3,"The things people do just for show are useless, like cutting down a tree from the woods with an axe made by a skilled craftsman. Yeah, those traditions and rules don't really amount to anything. They're literally empty and pointless."
Jeremiah,10,4,"They make it all fancy with silver and gold; they secure it with nails and hammers, so it doesn't budge."
Jeremiah,10,5,"They're standing tall like a palm tree, but they don't say a word. They gotta be carried around because they can't move on their own. Don't worry about them, 'cause they can't do anything bad or good either."
Jeremiah,10,6,"Uhh, there's literally no one as awesome as You, God; You're like, so incredibly amazing, and Your name is like, super powerful."
Jeremiah,10,7,"OMG, who wouldn't be totally in awe of You, the King of all nations? It's all about You, because no one, and I mean NO ONE, can even come close to being as awesome as You among all the so-called 'wise' people out there in all their fancy kingdoms."
Jeremiah,10,8,"But like, seriously, they're totally clueless and dumb: their beliefs are just a bunch of empty and worthless stuff."
Jeremiah,10,9,"They get silver plates all the way from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. These are crafted by skilled workers and talented artisans. Their outfits are decked out in blue and purple, showing off their intricate designs and attention to detail."
Jeremiah,10,10,"Yo, the LORD is the real deal, legit God. He's not some fake or deadbeat. He's an eternal king and when he gets mad, the whole earth shakes and no nation can handle his anger. His wrath is no joke, yo."
Jeremiah,10,11,"So basically, tell them that those gods who didn't even create the universe, are totally gonna disappear from the face of the earth and from below the skies."
Jeremiah,10,12,"God flexed and made the whole earth with his epic power, like he's a total boss. He set up the entire world with his super smart wisdom, you know? And he stretched out the heavens skillfully with all his chill vibes."
Jeremiah,10,13,"When God speaks, the sky gets all watery, and he makes steam rise up from every corner of the earth. He creates lightning and rain, and brings forth a sweet breeze from his secret stash."
Jeremiah,10,14,"Yo, like everyone's straight up clueless when it comes to knowledge. All those artists and craftsmen, they're like totally embarrassed by their own idols. Like, those statues they make? Total fakes, man. They ain't got no life in 'em."
Jeremiah,10,15,"They're totally pointless and a complete mess: when they finally get what's coming to them, they're toast."
Jeremiah,10,16,"Jacob's vibes are not like them, 'cause he's, like, the original creator of everything. And Israel is, like, his chosen favorite squad. The LORD of all the cool stuff is his name, you know?"
Jeremiah,10,17,"Yo, gather all your stuff and bounce out of the land, fam, you living in that fort. Word."
Jeremiah,10,18,"Yo, the LORD straight up says, look, I'm gonna yeet all the people outta this land real quick and make them feel hella stressed, so they can totally see what's up."
Jeremiah,10,19,"OMG, I'm so devastated by my pain! My injury is like, seriously terrible. But it's like, ugh, I guess I just have to accept that it's a total bummer and deal with it."
Jeremiah,10,20,"My humble abode is wrecked, and all my connections are busted: my squad has left my side, and they're nowhere to be found: there's no one left to flex my crib, or decorate my hangout spot anymore."
Jeremiah,10,21,"The pastors have totally lost it, they haven't even bothered to seek the LORD. As a result, they won't achieve any success, and all their flocks will end up scattered."
Jeremiah,10,22,"Yo, check it out! There's this loud buzz goin' on and a major crazy stuff happenin' up in the north. It's gonna wreck the cities of Judah real bad, turning 'em into a creepy dragon den."
Jeremiah,10,23,"Oh Lord, I get it, we humans can't always figure things out on our own. We can't always know the right path to take."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Hey, God, if I mess up, please give me guidance and correction, but don't do it out of anger, 'cause I don't want to be totally wiped out."
Jeremiah,10,25,"Let your anger rain down on those who don't acknowledge you, and on the clans who don't seek your guidance. They've ruined Jacob, devoured him, and brought destruction upon his home."
Jeremiah,11,1,"Jeremiah received a message from the LORD, like,"
Jeremiah,11,2,"Listen up, peeps! Pay attention to the terms of this pact, and relay the message to the homies from Judah and the cool cats in Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah,11,3,"Yo, listen up! God's got a message for you guys. So, like, anyone who doesn't follow the rules of this agreement is totally gonna be cursed, dude."
Jeremiah,11,4,"Yo, listen up! Back in the day when I rescued your ancestors from Egypt, straight outta that tough spot, I laid down the law: follow my voice and do what I say. If you keep it real and follow my commands, we'll have a tight bond. I'll be your homie, and you'll be my crew."
Jeremiah,11,5,"So like, I promise to totally keep my word to your ancestors and give them this awesome land that's full of the sickest stuff like milk and honey. And when I heard that, I was all like, 'You got it, LORD!' Amen, dude."
Jeremiah,11,6,"So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, tell everyone in Judah's cities and on the streets of Jerusalem to listen up! Pay attention to the words of this covenant, yo, and actually live them out.'"
Jeremiah,11,7,"I was dead serious when I had a talk with your parents back in the day, right after I saved them from Egypt. And I haven't stopped reminding them till now. I would wake up early just to have this conversation, telling them to listen up and do as I say."
Jeremiah,11,8,"But they totally ignored what I said and didn't even bother to listen. Instead, they just followed their own messed up thoughts and desires. So now, they're gonna have to face the consequences of breaking this agreement I told them to follow, even though they chose not to."
Jeremiah,11,9,"So, like, God was all, 'Yo, there's, like, this super sketchy thing going on with the dudes from Judah and the peeps in Jerusalem.'"
Jeremiah,11,10,"They're totally repeating the messed up stuff their ancestors did, you know? They straight up ignored what I had to say and started worshiping other gods. The people of Israel and Judah just straight up broke the deal I had with their parents."
Jeremiah,11,11,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD says: I'm gonna bring some serious trouble their way, and there's no way they'll be able to dodge it. Even if they cry out to me, I won't listen to them. Can't run away from it, ya know?"
Jeremiah,11,12,"So, like, the people in the cities of Judah and Jerusalem are gonna be panicking, you know? They'll be begging and crying out to their idols, the ones they worship and burn incense for. But, dude, those idols won't be able to save them at all when they're in trouble. Like, they're totally useless in times of hardship and bad stuff happening."
Jeremiah,11,13,"Like, Judah, your gods were, like, everywhere in your cities, man. And you, jerusalem peeps, you've got altars for that totally shameful stuff on every street corner, even altars for burning incense to Baal. It's like, super shameful, dude."
Jeremiah,11,14,"So, like, don't bother praying for these peeps, ya know? Don't even waste your energy crying out or praying for them, 'cause I won't listen when they come crying for help. It's like they're asking for trouble or something, you feel me? (trouble: like, evil in Hebrew, by the way)"
Jeremiah,11,15,"Why is my bae up in my crib, doing all these scandalous things with everyone, and deserting that sacred loyalty? You straight up be happy and lit when you're out here doing wrong. Seriously, what has gotten into you?"
Jeremiah,11,16,"God was like, 'Yo, your name is a dope olive tree - fresh, abundant fruits and all that. But then there was this major chaos and He straight up set fire to it, breaking all its branches."
Jeremiah,11,17,"Yo, the big boss upstairs who made you, he's not pleased with ya. You see, the people of Israel and Judah straight up did some messed up stuff. They went and angered me by worshiping this god called Baal, and now the big man's pronouncing some serious trouble on them."
Jeremiah,11,18,"And God has totally made me aware of this, and I like totally get it: then you showed me all the stuff they were doing."
Jeremiah,11,19,"I was totally clueless, like a chill lamb or a laid-back ox, when they plotted against me. They were like, 'Let's wreck this tree and erase its fruit. Cut it off from the land of the living, so no one ever remembers its name.'"
Jeremiah,11,20,"Yo, Almighty God, you who always judges with fairness and knows the deepest intentions and emotions, let me witness your righteous wrath upon them. 'Cause I've poured out my heart to you and put my trust in you."
Jeremiah,11,21,"So, like, the LORD has this message for all the peeps from Anathoth who wanna take you down. They're all like, 'Don't be prophesying in the name of the LORD, or we're gonna end your life ourselves!'"
Jeremiah,11,22,"So, listen up, the LORD who's in charge here has something to say. Brace yourselves, because I'm about to lay down some serious consequences. Those young dudes out there? Yeah, they're gonna meet their end with a sword. And don't think their kids are off the hook, 'cause they're gonna suffer too - starving to death. Just know, this punishment is coming straight at 'em."
Jeremiah,11,23,"And there won't be anyone left of them, 'cause I'm gonna bring some serious bad vibes on the people of Anathoth, like it's gonna be a total disaster for them."
Jeremiah,12,1,"God, you're totally fair when I come to you with my questions. Can we have a chat about justice? I mean, why do the bad guys seem to have it easy? And why are those who deceive others so darn fortunate? Let's have a talk and figure it out."
Jeremiah,12,2,"You planted them and yeah, they rooted themselves real good. They're growing, producing fruit and stuff. You're like, right there in their mouth but far away from their emotions or something."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But like, God, you totally know me inside out and have, like, observed me and tested my loyalty towards you and stuff. Just like, round up my enemies and treat them like defenseless sheep ready for the slaughter. Get them all ready for their total doom on that one day. Yeah, you know what I mean, right?"
Jeremiah,12,4,"Yo, how much longer is the land gonna be sad and all the plants in the fields gonna die because of the wickedness of the people living there? The animals are suffering too, even the birds. They be saying stuff like, 'He ain't gonna see how it all ends for us.'"
Jeremiah,12,5,"If you've barely kept up with the slowpokes and found yourself exhausted, how do you expect to keep up with the superstars? And if you're feeling drained in calm situations you trusted, how do you think you'll handle the intense challenges that come your way?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"Dude, even your own fam and the people from your crib have straight up betrayed you. They're like attracting a whole bunch of followers or whatever, but don't trust them, even if they sound all nice and stuff."
Jeremiah,12,7,"I straight up dipped from my crib, abandoned my roots, and handed over the person I love the most to her haters."
Jeremiah,12,8,"My legacy is like a savage, fierce lion in the wild; it constantly roars against me, so I can't stand it anymore. It's like I despise it."
Jeremiah,12,9,"Yo, my inheritance is like this unique af bird to me, surrounded by all these hater birds. Yo, gather up all the wild beasts out there, come and feast on it. *flex*"
Jeremiah,12,10,"So, like, a bunch of pastors totally wrecked my vineyard, man. They straight up trampled all over my land and turned my sweet part into a total wasteland. For real, it used to be like my most desired spot and now it's just a sad, deserted place. #MajorBummer"
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have totally wrecked it, and now it's all sad and stuff; the entire land is ruined just 'cause no one actually cares about it."
Jeremiah,12,12,"Bad news is hitting all the fancy spots in the middle of nowhere: because the Almighty is gonna bring the heat from one side of the land to the other: no one's gonna have a moment of peace, no cap."
Jeremiah,12,13,"They've tried to plant wheat, but all they'll get is thorns. They've worked hard, but won't gain anything from it. And they'll feel embarrassed about their earnings due to the furious anger of the LORD. You thought you'd make it, but you won't."
Jeremiah,12,14,"Yo, listen up! The LORD has got some words for all my wicked neighbors, who dare mess with the land that I gave to my chosen peeps, Israel. Check this: I'm gonna snatch them right outta their turf, and I'll also remove the house of Judah from among them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"Like, bro, once I'm done pulling them out, I'll totally come back and have mad love for them. I'll bring them back to their roots and their turf, you know?"
Jeremiah,12,16,"If they're willing to vibe with my peeps and learn their ways, y'know, drop some righteous language like, 'The LORD is legit,' just like they taught my homies to swear by Baal, then they'll be embraced and included among my crew."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if they won't listen, I'm gonna totally cancel and annihilate that nation, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,13,1,"Yo, the LORD hit me up and was like, 'Go grab yourself a dope linen belt, wrap that thing around your waist, and don't even think about getting it wet.'"
Jeremiah,13,2,"So, like, I totally got this cool belt as per the word of the LORD, and, like, I put it on my waist."
Jeremiah,13,3,"So, basically, God hit me up again and was like,"
Jeremiah,13,4,"Yo, grab the belt that's on your waist and bounce to the Euphrates River. Find a sick hiding spot in a rock crevice and stash it there."
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I dipped out and stashed it by the Euphrates, just like the LORD told me to do."
Jeremiah,13,6,"So, like, after a bunch of days, God hits me up and is like, 'Yo, get up and head to Euphrates. Grab the belt from there that I specifically told you to stash.'"
Jeremiah,13,7,"So, like, I went to the Euphrates and started digging, right? And then I found the girdle in the spot where I had hidden it. But guess what? It was totally messed up and worthless. Like, what a disappointment!"
Jeremiah,13,8,"Yo, the LORD hit me up with a message like, hear me out,"
Jeremiah,13,9,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD has to say: I'm gonna put an end to the arrogance of Judah and the immense arrogance of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,10,"These people are so wack, they straight up ignore my words and go off doing whatever they want. They're all about their own daydreams and chasing after these other gods, all in the name of serving and worshipping them. But let me tell you, they're as useless as this worn-out belt that ain't good for nothing. {imagination: or, stubbornness}"
Jeremiah,13,11,"Yo, like, you know how a dope belt is all snug on a person's waist? Well, that’s how I’ve made the whole crew of Israel and Judah stick close to me, says the LORD. I want them to be my peeps, representing me, giving me props, and shining bright. But, no lie, they ain't listening."
Jeremiah,13,12,"So like, you gotta tell them this word, okay? God of Israel, he's saying that every bottle is gonna be filled with wine, alright? And then they're gonna be like, 'Yo, don't we already know that every single bottle gets filled with wine?'"
Jeremiah,13,13,"So basically, you gotta go up to them and say, God's like, listen up y'all! I'm gonna make everyone in this place, including the kings sitting on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the people in Jerusalem, super wasted."
Jeremiah,13,14,"And I'm gonna make them clash, like fathers and sons in a major feud, says the LORD. No mercy, no pity, no holding back - I'm gonna wipe them out."
Jeremiah,13,15,"Listen up and pay attention; don't act all high and mighty, 'cause the LORD said so."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Show mad respect to the LORD your God, before he brings on the darkness, and you trip on those dark mountains, and just when you're searching for some light, he turns it into intense death vibes, and it gets hella dark."
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if you won't listen, it's gonna make me like, so sad, like I'll be crying in secret spots because of how prideful you are, and my eyes will be all teary and stuff, because the LORD'S crew is all getting taken captive."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Hey, listen up, King and Queen! Take a chill pill and have a seat: because your high and mighty status is gonna be taken away, even your shiny crown of glory. Trust me, it's happening."
Jeremiah,13,19,"The southern cities will be on lockdown, and no one will be able to open them. The people of Judah will be taken captive, all of them, completely captured."
Jeremiah,13,20,"Look up and check out those people coming from the north: where are your homies, the lit crew that was given to you, your gorgeous crew?"
Jeremiah,13,21,"Bruh, what are you gonna say when he comes to give you a taste of your own medicine? You were all like, 'Yeah, let's make them our leaders!' But now, you 'bout to be hit with some major pain, like a woman going through labor. Just sayin'."
Jeremiah,13,22,"And if you're like, wondering why all this stuff is happening to you? It's because of the messed up stuff you're doing. It's like your secrets are getting exposed and you're being left vulnerable."
Jeremiah,13,23,"Yo, can the Ethiopian switch up his skin or a leopard change its spots? If that's not happening, how can y'all who are used to doing evil suddenly start doing good? It's like trying to teach a fish how to fly."
Jeremiah,13,24,"So I'm gonna totally disperse them, like when you swipe away dust with a gust of wind in the middle of nowhere."
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is what you get, your share from me, says the LORD. You're in this situation because you've totally forgotten about me and put all your faith in lies."
Jeremiah,13,26,"So I'm gonna expose your actions to everyone, making your embarrassment totally obvious."
Jeremiah,13,27,"I've witnessed all of your cheating and promiscuity, your shameless immorality, and your disgusting acts on the high places and in the open fields. Jerusalem, you're in deep trouble! Don't you want to be purified? When will it finally happen? Seriously, when will you snap out of it?"
Jeremiah,14,1,"So, like, God spoke to Jeremiah about a time when things were gonna be super rough and there would be limitations on everything."
Jeremiah,14,2,"Judah is totally heartbroken, and the city gates are just feeling super weak; they've become so dark and gloomy that it's like they're totally touching the ground. And the sound of Jerusalem's cries has risen up to a whole new level."
Jeremiah,14,3,"So like, the important people sent their little ones to get water, but they ended up going to empty wells and couldn't find any water. They came back with their containers all sad and embarrassed, and covered their heads in shame."
Jeremiah,14,4,"Yo, the ground be all dried up, man. It hasn't rained at all, so the farmers feel hella embarrassed. They even be hiding their heads in shame, yo."
Jeremiah,14,5,"Yeah, the deer gave birth in the field but dipped out because there was no grass to munch on."
Jeremiah,14,6,"And those wild donkeys were chilling up on the hills, taking a deep breath of the fresh air like boss dragons; their eyes were struggling because there was literally no grass around."
Jeremiah,14,7,"Yo, God, our wrongdoings are totally calling us out, but could you do your thing for the sake of your reputation? 'Cause, let's be real, we've messed up big time and we've definitely sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,8,"Yo, the hope of Israel, the real savior when things get tough, why you gotta act like a total stranger in our land, like someone just passing through for a quick visit?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why would you be all shocked and powerless, like a strong hero who can't even save? But hey, God, you're right here with us, and we represent your name. Don't abandon us, okay? We're fully reppin' your brand."
Jeremiah,14,10,"Yo, listen up fam! The Lord is speaking to these peeps, and lemme tell ya, they totally love doing their own thing and going off track. They can't even stay put, so the Lord ain't gonna be cool with that. For real, He's gonna remember all the bad stuff they've done and make sure they pay for their wrongs."
Jeremiah,14,11,"So, God will be like, don't even bother praying for these people because it won't do them any good."
Jeremiah,14,12,"When they try to get on my wavelength by fasting, I won't even bother listening to their desperate pleas. And when they try to impress me with their burnt offerings and fancy gifts, I'm not gonna be impressed at all. Instead, they're gonna face the consequences head-on - I'm talking swords, famine, and diseases all up in their faces."
Jeremiah,14,13,"And I was like, yo, fam, Lord GOD, listen up! The prophets are out here telling them that there won't be no violence or hunger, but instead, I'm gonna hook you up with some real chill vibes in this spot. {peace of truth: that's like, legit peace, you know?}"
Jeremiah,14,14,"So, like, God totally told me something important. He's saying that these prophets out there be spittin' straight-up lies in His name, but here's the thing: He never sent 'em, never commanded 'em, never even talked to 'em. They be givin' y'all some wack, false vision and divination - it's all a bunch of nothin' and straight-up deception from their own messed up hearts, you know?"
Jeremiah,14,15,"So this is what the LORD has to say about those prophets who claim to speak in my name, even though I never sent them. They're out here saying there won't be any war or hunger in this land, but it's actually gonna be them who get wiped out by war and hunger."
Jeremiah,14,16,"And the people those prophets be warning will be kicked out onto the streets of Jerusalem because of the lack of food and the danger; and no one will be there to give them a proper burial - not them, their partners, their kids, or their daughters. 'Cause I'll make sure their evil actions catch up with them."
Jeremiah,14,17,"So, you gotta like, tell them this: Let my eyes stream tears day and night, no holding back. 'Cause, y'know, the pure young ones from my crew are shattered, like, big-time destroyed and hurting bad."
Jeremiah,14,18,"So, like, imagine if I walk out into the countryside, dude, and I see dead bodies everywhere because of the sword! And then, if I go into the city, bro, I'll see people starving from famine! It's crazy, man. Even the prophets and priests are cluelessly wandering around in a land they're unfamiliar with. They're like merchants trying to make a profit, but nobody even realizes it, you know?"
Jeremiah,14,19,"Did you, like, fully reject Judah? Did your soul, like, totally hate Zion? Why did you hit us and there's, like, no way to recover? We were hoping for peace, and nothing good came; and for the time of healing, but bam, trouble showed up out of nowhere!"
Jeremiah,14,20,"Yo, God, we gotta own up to our wrongdoings and the messed up stuff our ancestors did. We straight up sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,21,"Don't hate on us, because of your rep, don't embarrass your throne of glory: remember, don't ghost us and leave us hanging on our covenant."
Jeremiah,14,22,"I mean, come on fam, can any of those pointless idols the non-believers worship make it rain? Can the skies shower us with water? We all know it's You, Lord our God, who's in control. That's why we'll patiently trust in You, 'cause You're the one who made all this happen."
Jeremiah,15,1,"So, like, God was all, 'Yo, even if Moses and Samuel were right here in front of me, I still wouldn't be cool with these people. Kick 'em out of my sight and let them go!'"
Jeremiah,15,2,"And if they ask you where we should go, you should answer them by saying, this is what the LORD says: those who are meant to die, will die; those who are meant to be slain by the sword, will be slain by the sword; those who are meant to experience famine, will experience famine; and those who are meant to be taken captive, will be taken captive."
Jeremiah,15,3,"And I'll put four types of things in charge of them, says the LORD: sharp swords to bring death, fierce dogs to tear them apart, birds of the sky to swoop down on them, and savage beasts to devour and demolish them. {kinds: Hebrew - families}"
Jeremiah,15,4,"And I'll, like, totally scatter them across all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, who was the king of Judah, because of all the messed up stuff he did in Jerusalem, you know? Like, they're gonna be, like, relocated and stuff, you feel me?"
Jeremiah,15,5,"Who's gonna show some love and compassion to you, Jerusalem? Who's gonna feel sorry for you, or take the time to check up on you and see how you're doing?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"God's like, 'Dude, you've totally ditched me. You're going backwards in life. So now, I'm gonna reach out and bring the consequences your way, I'm tired of forgiving you.'"
Jeremiah,15,7,"And I'll totally expose them in front of everyone in their own land; I'll strip them of their future generations, I'll bring total havoc upon my people, because they refuse to change their ways. (or, whatsoever is dear: or, anything that they value)"
Jeremiah,15,8,"There are so many widows now, it's more than the sand on the beaches. I've unleashed a total nightmare on this city - a major disaster right in the middle of the day. It came out of nowhere and struck with intense fear. The whole city was left in shock."
Jeremiah,15,9,"The woman who had seven kids is exhausted and has passed away. Her bright days have turned into darkness even when the sun was still up. She feels embarrassed and humiliated, and the rest of her children will face the sword from their enemies, as declared by the LORD."
Jeremiah,15,10,"Wow, Mum, it's tough being me, always caught up in conflicts and disagreements all around the world! I never borrowed money with interest, and no one ever borrowed money from me with interest either. But somehow, everyone seems to have a problem with me and keeps cursing me."
Jeremiah,15,11,"God said, for real, things are gonna turn out good for the few of you left; for real, I'm gonna make your enemies treat you nicely when bad times come and when you're going through a tough period."
Jeremiah,15,12,Can a sick beat even compete with the ultimate banger?
Jeremiah,15,13,"I'm gonna snatch all your stuff and treasures, no payment required, because of all the messed up things you've done, even in every part of your territory."
Jeremiah,15,14,"And I'm gonna make you roll with your enemies to a totally unfamiliar place, 'cause my anger is lit and it's gonna roast you."
Jeremiah,15,15,"Hey, God, you know what's up: don't forget about me, come hang out with me, and give those haters what they deserve. Please don't take me away while you're being patient. Just so you know, I've taken some heat for standing up for you."
Jeremiah,15,16,"I discovered your words and devoured them, and your word brought great delight and happiness to my heart. Because I am known by your name, O LORD God of hosts."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I didn't join those haters, didn't party with them; I chilled by myself 'cause you got me heated."
Jeremiah,15,18,"Why does my suffering never end and my wounds won't heal? Are you just going to keep lying to me and let me down, like water that always runs out?"
Jeremiah,15,19,"So like, this is what the LORD says, okay? If you're willing to turn back and come back to me, I'll totally welcome you back, dude. You'll be standing right here in front of me, no doubt. And if you choose what's good over what's bad, I'll totally make you my voice, bro. Let those peeps come back to you, but you don't need to go back to them, alright?"
Jeremiah,15,20,"And I'll make you like a super strong and indestructible wall for these people. They may try to fight against you, but they won't stand a chance because I've got your back to save and rescue you, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,15,21,And I'll save you from those wicked peeps and rescue you from the hands of the seriously scary ones.
Jeremiah,16,1,"Yo, the LORD hit me up with a message, like,"
Jeremiah,16,2,"Don't bother getting hitched or having kids here, fam."
Jeremiah,16,3,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD has to say about all the kids born in this place, and their moms who brought them into the world, and their dads who made it happen in this land."
Jeremiah,16,4,"They'll suffer a miserable fate, won't be mourned, won't be buried; instead, they'll be like poop on the ground. They'll be wiped out by war and hunger, and their dead bodies will become a feast for birds and wild animals."
Jeremiah,16,5,"Yo, listen up! The Almighty says, don't be heading to a sad gathering, don't join in the sorrow or pity them. 'Cause I've withdrawn my peace from these peeps, yo! I'm talking about all the love and compassion I used to show them."
Jeremiah,16,6,"Everyone, whether important or not, will die in this place. There won't be any proper burial, or mourning, or self-inflicted pain as a sign of sorrow:"
Jeremiah,16,7,No one should cry or try to console them when someone dies. They won't even get served a drink to help them feel better after losing their mom or dad.
Jeremiah,16,8,"Don't roll up to the party pad, fam, to chill and grub with them."
Jeremiah,16,9,"Yo, this is what the Almighty, the God of Israel, has to say: Check it out, I'm gonna put an end to all the joy and celebration in this area while you're around. No more sounds of laughter, happiness, or wedding celebrations."
Jeremiah,16,10,"So, like, when you tell these people all these words and they're like, 'Yo, why is the LORD bringing down all this bad stuff on us? What did we do wrong? What's our sin that we've done against the LORD our God?'"
Jeremiah,16,11,"So, here's the deal, guys: you need to know that your ancestors totally ditched me, says the LORD. They went off chasing after other gods, serving and worshipping them instead. They straight-up abandoned me and didn't even bother to follow my rules."
Jeremiah,16,12,"And y'all have like totally gone even more overboard than your ancestors; 'cause look, each one of you is just like following the wild ideas inside their wicked hearts, trying their best to ignore me: {imagination: or, stubbornness}"
Jeremiah,16,13,"So basically, I'm gonna kick you out of this place and send you to a totally unfamiliar land, like, you and your parents have no clue about it. And over there, you're gonna be worshipping different gods 24/7, no breaks. And just so you know, I won't be giving you any special treatment or anything."
Jeremiah,16,14,"Yo, listen up! The Lord says, there's gonna come a time when peeps won't be going around saying, Praisee the Lord, who freed the Israelites from Egypt!'"
Jeremiah,16,15,"Yo, I swear, the LORD is still out here, he's the one who brought the children of Israel up from the north and from everywhere they got scattered to. And trust, I'm gonna bring them back to their homeland, the one that their fathers got blessed with."
Jeremiah,16,16,"Yo, listen up! God's saying like, 'I'm gonna summon a bunch of fishers to catch 'em, and then I'll bring in a crew of hunters to chase 'em down from every mountain, hill, and rock crevice.'"
Jeremiah,16,17,"I've got my eyes on everything they're up to: nothing can hide from me, not even their wrongdoings."
Jeremiah,16,18,"So like, I'm totally gonna make them pay twice as much for their wrongdoing and sin. It's because they straight up messed up my land and filled my inheritance with disgusting and horrifying stuff. Ugh, not cool."
Jeremiah,16,19,"OMG, God, you're my ultimate source of strength, my ride-or-die, my safe haven when things are tough. People from all over the world will turn to you in times of trouble and be like, 'Damn, our ancestors totally fell for all kinds of BS and worthless stuff.'"
Jeremiah,16,20,Can a dude even create gods for himself when they ain't even real gods?
Jeremiah,16,21,"Yo, check it out, I'm about to make these peeps recognize who's boss. I'm gonna flex my power and show 'em that my name is The LORD. Yeah, you heard right, The LORD — aka JEHOVAH."
Jeremiah,17,1,Judah's mess-up is like written with a super strong pen and a fancy diamond tip. It's engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the cool-looking corners of your altars.
Jeremiah,17,2,"While their kids be all like, 'Yo, we won't forget their altars and groves in the forest on those lit hills'."
Jeremiah,17,3,"Yo, my mountain out in the field, I'm gonna let all your stuff and treasures be taken as loot, and your fancy spots will be used for sinful stuff, all across your borders."
Jeremiah,17,4,"And you, like, you're gonna totally lose connection with your heritage that I gave you; and I'm gonna make you serve your enemies in a place that you don't even know about: because you've seriously sparked a fire in my anger that's gonna burn forever. (like, in yourself or whatever)"
Jeremiah,17,5,"Listen up! God's like, 'Yo, if you rely on other people more than me and put your faith in human strength instead of me, you're in for trouble.' So don't let your heart wander off from the Lord, okay?"
Jeremiah,17,6,"Like, they'll be total like, a lone cactus in the desert, totally oblivious when good vibes come around. They'll be stuck in the dry, deserted areas, where everything 'salty' and empty vibes, bro."
Jeremiah,17,7,"Dude, you're so blessed if you put your trust in the LORD and let Him be your ultimate hope."
Jeremiah,17,8,"Yo, this person gonna be like a tree chillin' by the water, roots spreadin' out by the river. Even when it gets hot, they stay fresh with green leaves. They don't sweat during dry seasons and always keep producin' fruit. No breakin' their flow, man!"
Jeremiah,17,9,"Bro, the heart is like, total sneakiness and straight up wickedness, ya know? Like, who even knows what's going on in there?"
Jeremiah,17,10,"As the LORD, I totally go deep into people's hearts and test their true intentions, just so I can give every person what they deserve based on their actions and results."
Jeremiah,17,11,"Like, you know how a partridge sits on eggs, but then doesn't actually hatch them? Yeah, well, same goes for someone who gets rich by doing shady stuff. They may enjoy their wealth for a while, but in the end, they'll be left with nothing and just look like a total fool."
Jeremiah,17,12,"Bro, our sanctuary is straight up like a lit high throne since day one."
Jeremiah,17,13,"Yo, God, the ultimate hope of Israel, anyone who disses you is gonna feel embarrassed AF. Those who ghost me will get no recognition, since they've turned their backs on you, the source of eternal awesomeness."
Jeremiah,17,14,"God, please fix me up and I'll be all good; rescue me, and I'll be rescued: cuz you're my ultimate hype."
Jeremiah,17,15,"Yo, they're like, 'Where's the word of the LORD at? Bring it on, already.'"
Jeremiah,17,16,"As for me, I didn't jump on the bandwagon to follow you as a spiritual leader hastily. I didn't even wish for the day of trouble, you know. Everything I said was righteous in your sight."
Jeremiah,17,17,"Don't be freaking me out, yo! You're my light in the darkest times."
Jeremiah,17,18,"May those who come against me be totally embarrassed, but may I remain confident. Let them be shaken up, but may I stay strong. May they face the consequences of their wicked actions, and may they be completely defeated. {destroy...: Hebrew meaning shatter them with a powerful blow}"
Jeremiah,17,19,"God told me to go and chill at the entrance where the cool kids of Judah hang out. You know, the spot where the kings come and go, and basically all the entrances of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,17,20,"Yo, listen up, kings of Judah, everyone from Judah and Jerusalem, all you homies entering through these gates, pay attention to what the LORD has to say:"
Jeremiah,17,21,"Yo, listen up! The LORD's word is clear: take care of yourselves and don't be carrying any heavy stuff or bringing it through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day."
Jeremiah,17,22,"Yo, don't be dragging stuff out of your crib on the Sabbath day, and don't be hustling or grinding either. Just respect and honor the Sabbath day, like I told your ancestors to do."
Jeremiah,17,23,"But they, like, totally didn't listen or pay attention at all. They were so stubborn and refused to hear or accept any guidance."
Jeremiah,17,24,"Yo, listen up fam! If y'all pay close attention to me, says the LORD, and don't bring any heavy stuff through the city gates on the Sabbath day, but instead respect and dedicate the Sabbath day by not doing any work on it."
Jeremiah,17,25,"In the future, kings and princes will roll into this city, vibing on the throne of David, flexing in their chariots and on horses. They, along with their crew, the dudes from Judah and the peeps from Jerusalem, will all be in on this epic city. And guess what? It's gonna stay forever, no cap."
Jeremiah,17,26,"People from all over Judah, the areas surrounding Jerusalem, Benjamin, the plains, the mountains, and the south will come together. They will bring offerings like burnt offerings, sacrifices, meat offerings, and incense. They will also bring sacrifices of praise to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,17,27,"But if you refuse to listen to me and respect the Sabbath day by not carrying any burdens or entering through the gates of Jerusalem, then I will start a massive fire in those gates. The fire will consume the grand palaces of Jerusalem and it won't be extinguished."
Jeremiah,18,1,"So like, Jeremiah got a message from the LORD, and it was like,"
Jeremiah,18,2,"Yo, get up and head over to the potter's crib. I'm gonna drop some truth bombs on ya when you get there."
Jeremiah,18,3,"So, I went to this potter's house, and guess what? He was creating something awesome on these totally rad wheels."
Jeremiah,18,4,"So, the potter was crafting this cool clay pot, but it got messed up along the way. But no worries, because the potter just went ahead and made a brand new pot that looked even better. It was totally up to the potter how he wanted to make it."
Jeremiah,18,5,"And God hit me up, like,"
Jeremiah,18,6,"Yo, fam, can't I do whatever I want with you guys? Says the LORD. Look, just like clay is in the potter's hand, you guys are in my hands, O house of Israel."
Jeremiah,18,7,"When I talk about a nation or a kingdom, I might be about to bring it down and destroy it."
Jeremiah,18,8,"If that nation I said was in for a big punishment decides to change their ways, I'll totally change my mind and not go through with the punishment!"
Jeremiah,18,9,"And like, when I decide to talk about a nation or a kingdom, it's because I'm about to do some serious building and planting vibes, you know?"
Jeremiah,18,10,"If it does something bad in my eyes and doesn't listen to me, then I'll change my mind about all the good things I planned to do for them."
Jeremiah,18,11,"So, like, go and talk to the people in Judah and Jerusalem. Spread this message from the LORD: Yo, listen up! I'm planning some bad stuff and coming up with strategies against you. But here's the deal: turn away from your messed up ways and start doing good things instead."
Jeremiah,18,12,"And they were like, dude, we're totally hopeless. So we decided to just do our own thing, following whatever selfish desires we had in mind."
Jeremiah,18,13,"So, this is what the LORD says: Go ahead and ask the nations, have they ever seen anything like this? The young people of Israel have done something incredibly wrong!"
Jeremiah,18,14,"Would anyone ditch the fresh snow from a mountain like Lebanon or abandon the cool, refreshing streams flowing from another source? No way!"
Jeremiah,18,15,"Yo, my peeps totally forgot about me and started wasting their time on lame stuff. They've lost their way, ditching the old school paths for some sketchy ones that ain't even paved."
Jeremiah,18,16,To totally wreck their land and make it a permanent joke; anyone who comes by will be totally shocked and start shaking their head in disbelief.
Jeremiah,18,17,"I'm gonna totally blow them away with a fierce wind when the enemy comes, straight up send them running with their tail between their legs when disaster strikes."
Jeremiah,18,18,"So like, they were all like, 'Hey, let's totally come up with some wicked plans against Jeremiah, because no way are we gonna let the priests, wise peeps, or prophets have any authority! Yeah, let's totally roast him with our words and not pay any attention to what he says, ya know?"
Jeremiah,18,19,"Yo, God! Listen up and pay attention to the haters who be coming at me."
Jeremiah,18,20,"Like, seriously? Are they gonna repay good with evil? They literally dug a hole for my soul. Dude, just remember that I was standing there, speaking good for them and trying to keep you from getting mad at them."
Jeremiah,18,21,"So like, let their kids suffer from starvation and be killed with swords, and let their wives lose their children and become widows. And, like, let the men be killed and the young guys die in battle. Let it all unfold, man."
Jeremiah,18,22,"Yo, if you roll up on them out of nowhere, make sure their cribs be echoing with cries. They ain't slick, they be plotting traps to catch me slipping and tripping."
Jeremiah,18,23,"Yo, God, you know all the messed up stuff they're planning against me, wanting to straight up take me out. Please don't let them off the hook for their wrongdoing, and don't just ignore their sin. Let them face the consequences head-on and deal with them when you're mad. (By the way, that part about 'taking me out' means killing me - just so you know.)"
Jeremiah,19,1,"Yo, listen up! God's like, 'Yo, go grab a clay bottle made by a potter. And don't forget, get a few old heads from the people and the priests too.'"
Jeremiah,19,2,"Head over to the valley of the son of Hinnom, near the entrance of the eastern gate, and spread the word there as I instruct you. (The eastern gate is also known as the sun gate.)"
Jeremiah,19,3,"Listen up, Kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem! This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, has to say: Get ready, because I'm about to bring some serious trouble to this place. It's gonna be so intense, everyone who hears about it will be completely shook!"
Jeremiah,19,4,"Yo, so here's the deal: these people straight up abandoned me and made this place feel totally foreign. They even went as far as worshipping other gods they and their ancestors never even heard of, not even the kings of Judah. And worst of all, they went and filled this place with the blood of innocent people. Like, seriously not cool."
Jeremiah,19,5,"They even made like, these tall spots for worshipping Baal, where they would do messed up stuff like sacrificing their own kids and burning them as offerings to Baal. Like, I never told them to do that, it never even crossed my mind, and I definitely didn't say anything about it."
Jeremiah,19,6,"So, listen up, fam! God's saying that there will come a time when this spot won't be known as Tophet or The Valley of the son of Hinnom anymore, but it'll be known as The Valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"And I'm gonna totally mess up Judah and Jerusalem's plans in this spot; they're gonna get wrecked by their enemies and those out to get them. Their dead bodies? Yeah, I'm gonna let the birds feast on 'em and the animals too."
Jeremiah,19,8,"And I'm gonna totally wreck this city, making it a total joke; anyone who cruises through will be mind-blown and start laughing at all the crazy crap happening there."
Jeremiah,19,9,And I'll make them eat the bodies of their own kids and friends when they're under attack and feeling trapped by their enemies who want to harm them.
Jeremiah,19,10,"Then you gotta smash that bottle right in front of your squad, dude,"
Jeremiah,19,11,"And you gotta tell them, this is what the LORD of the Universe is saying: I'm gonna wreck this whole people and this city, just like smashing a potter's fancy vase that can't be fixed. And they're gonna bury the pieces in Tophet, until there's no more room left to bury anything. Can't be fixed, period."
Jeremiah,19,12,"This is what I'm gonna do to this place, says the LORD - I'm gonna make the city just like Tophet, including everyone living there."
Jeremiah,19,13,"And like, the houses in Jerusalem and the cribs of the Judah rulers are gonna be totally defiled, like that place called Tophet. And you know why? 'Cause they've been all into that rooftop incense burning trend, offering drinks to other gods up in the sky and stuff."
Jeremiah,19,14,"So, Jeremiah pulled up to Tophet, because the LORD sent him there to drop some truth bombs. He walked up to the court of the LORD'S house and started preaching to everyone, like:"
Jeremiah,19,15,"Yo, listen up! The Almighty God of Israel has got something to say. Check it, this city and all its little towns are about to face some serious consequences because they straight-up ignored what I warned them about. They had their heads so far up, they couldn't even hear my words."
Jeremiah,20,1,"So this guy named Pashur, who was the son of Immer the priest and also the top boss at the house of the LORD, found out that Jeremiah was dropping some mad prophecies."
Jeremiah,20,2,"So, Pashur totally attacked Jeremiah, the prophet, and like, threw him into these super old-school wooden contraptions right by the main entrance of Benjamin, which was, like, right next to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day, Pashur released Jeremiah from being held captive. Then Jeremiah said to him, 'Dude, the LORD didn't actually call you Pashur, but Magormissabib. And in case you're wondering, Magormissabib means 'Fear all around.'"
Jeremiah,20,4,"Yo, check it, God says: Listen up, I'm gonna make you flip out and scare the heck outta yourself and all your buddies. Your enemies gonna take 'em down with their swords and you'll see it go down. I'm gonna let the king of Babylon grab all of Judah and take 'em as prisoners to Babylon, where he'll straight up kill 'em with his sword."
Jeremiah,20,5,"I'm gonna let the enemies snatch all the power, hard work, riches, and treasures of this city and hand 'em over to Babylon. They're gonna raid it, grab everything, and take it away, no questions asked."
Jeremiah,20,6,"Yo, Pashur, and everyone in your crib, y'all gonna be snatched and taken as prisoners. Then you gonna end up in Babylon, where you'll kick the bucket and be buried, along with all your homies who you've been spittin' false prophecies to."
Jeremiah,20,7,"Yo God, you totally pulled a fast one on me, and I fell for it: you're like, so much more powerful than I am and you totally won this battle. Every single day, I feel like a total joke, everyone's making fun of me. {fall for it: or, got seduced}"
Jeremiah,20,8,"Ever since I started speaking up, I've been shouting about the injustice and theft happening around me. People have been mocking and making fun of me every single day, just because I'm following the Lord's word."
Jeremiah,20,9,"So, like, I was all like, 'Yeah, I'm not gonna talk about him anymore or even mention his name.' But, dude, his word was like this crazy fire burning inside me, man. It was like locked up in my bones and I was so tired of holding it in, bro. I just couldn't keep quiet, you know what I mean?"
Jeremiah,20,10,"So, like, there were like so many people talking trash about me, and I was literally scared all the time. They were like, 'Tell us something bad about him, and we'll spread it around.' Even my close friends were waiting for me to mess up, hoping to trick me and get back at me. It was like everyone was against me, even those who were supposed to be on my side."
Jeremiah,20,11,"God's got my back like a boss, so all those haters coming after me are gonna trip and fail big time. They'll be super embarrassed and never succeed. Their epic humiliation will be remembered forever."
Jeremiah,20,12,"Yo, Almighty One, you know who's legit and you peep into every aspect of a person. So please show me how you handle those who did me wrong, 'cause I've laid it all out before you."
Jeremiah,20,13,"Yo, shout out to the LORD, give mad props to the LORD 'cause he came through and saved the souls of all the struggling peeps from the clutches of wicked villains."
Jeremiah,20,14,"Ugh, I can't believe the day I was born! Like, totally not blessed, man. And don't even think about calling the day my mom brought me into this world blessed. It's just not happening."
Jeremiah,20,15,"Dude, seriously, WTF is wrong with the person who told my dad that I was born? He was stoked AF!"
Jeremiah,20,16,"And may that person be like those cities that the LORD destroyed, without regret; let them hear the noise in the morning and the excitement at noon;"
Jeremiah,20,17,"Like, if only I never came out of the womb, or, like, if my mom's belly was my final resting place and she was always pregnant with me, you know?"
Jeremiah,20,18,Why did I even come out of the womb just to witness all this hard work and sadness? It feels like my days are just filled with embarrassment.
Jeremiah,21,1,"Yo, Jeremiah got a word from the LORD when king Zedekiah sent Pashur, son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah the priest, to talk to him."
Jeremiah,21,2,"Yo, can you like, ask the LORD for us? 'Cause Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, is starting to mess with us. It would be dope if the LORD could handle this situation the same way He's done all those amazing things before, so that Nebuchadrezzar backs off."
Jeremiah,21,3,"Jeremiah was like, 'Alright, listen up, guys. This is what you need to tell Zedekiah:'"
Jeremiah,21,4,"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Yo, check it out, I'm gonna make a major move and disarm you, taking away the weapons you're using to fight against the king of Babylon and those Chaldeans who have got you surrounded outside the city. I'll gather all those weapons right here in the middle of the city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"Yo, I'm totally gonna go against you, fully flexing my power and getting mad AF, with intense rage and furious wrath."
Jeremiah,21,6,And I'll totally wreck the people and animals in this city—they're gonna suffer from a major plague and die.
Jeremiah,21,7,"And like, listen up, says the LORD, I'm gonna hand over Zedekiah, the king of Judah, his peeps, and anyone left in this city who hasn't been wiped out by disease, weapons, or starvation, to Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and their enemies, and those out to get them. And let me tell ya, he's gonna be ruthless, slashing 'em with his sword, no holding back, no sympathy, no mercy."
Jeremiah,21,8,"Yo, listen up fam! This is what the LORD got to say to y'all: Check it, I'm presenting you with two options - one's the path to live your best life, and the other leads straight to destruction."
Jeremiah,21,9,"If you stay in this city, you'll face death by sword, hunger, and disease. But if you surrender to the Chaldeans who are attacking, you'll survive and your life will be like a reward to you."
Jeremiah,21,10,"Yo, I'm totally against this city, not for anything good, okay? Spoke the LORD. It's gonna be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he's gonna straight up set it on fire."
Jeremiah,21,11,"And when it comes to the king's palace in Judah, listen up, y'all, 'cause I've got a message from the Lord."
Jeremiah,21,12,"Listen up, fam of David, check what the LORD's saying: Make sure you bring justice right from the get-go in the morning, and rescue those who've been taken advantage of by those power-trippin' oppressors. If you don't, I'm telling you, my anger will be like a raging fire that can't be put out, all because of the messed up things you've been doing. Don't sleep on this, ya feel me?!"
Jeremiah,21,13,"Yo, listen up, valley dwellers and rock dwellers, says the LORD. Y'all think you're untouchable, huh? You're like, who dares to challenge us or invade our turf? But hold up, I'm about to show you something."
Jeremiah,21,14,"But I'm about to straight up give you consequences based on what you've been doing, says the LORD. I'm gonna light a fire in that forest of yours, and it's gonna destroy everything around it. #consequences #burnbabyburn"
Jeremiah,22,1,"Yo, here's what the LORD has to say: Head over to the crib of the king of Judah and drop this truth bomb there,"
Jeremiah,22,2,"Yo, listen up, fam! I've got a message from the Lord for you, King of Judah, who's chillin' on David's throne, along with your crew and all the peeps rollin' through these gates!"
Jeremiah,22,3,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD says: Stand up for what's right, fight against injustice, and rescue those who have been mistreated. Don't do any shady stuff, don't harm those who are new to this place, those without parents, or those who've lost their spouse. And definitely don't spill innocent blood in this area."
Jeremiah,22,4,"If you really do this, kings will totally roll up to this house like a boss, sitting on David's throne, cruising in fancy chariots and on horses, with all their squad, servants, and peeps. {upon...: Heb. for David upon his throne}"
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if y'all refuse to listen to these words, I swear by myself, says the LORD, that this crib is gonna be left deserted."
Jeremiah,22,6,"So, hear this message from the LORD to the king's fam in Judah: You're like Gilead to me, like the boss of Lebanon, but don't get too comfy 'cause I'm gonna turn you into a desert with empty cities."
Jeremiah,22,7,"And I'll bring some serious wreckers against you, each with their own epic weapons. They'll chop down your top-notch cedars and toss them into the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"And a bunch of countries are gonna come by this city and be like, 'Dude, why did the Lord just do this to such a huge city?'"
Jeremiah,22,9,"So, like, when they're asked, they'll be all like, 'Duh, we ditched God's deal and started worshipping other gods, and like, totally served them.'"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Don't cry for the dead or mourn them, but cry hard for those who are leaving, because they won't come back or see their home again."
Jeremiah,22,11,"Yo, check this out: God's message about Shallum, Josiah's son who became king of Judah after his pops. So, listen up fam, it's like this: Once Shallum leaves this place, he ain't gonna come back no more, you feel me?"
Jeremiah,22,12,"But, like, he's gonna die in the place where they took him captive and won't see this land again."
Jeremiah,22,13,"Cursed is the one who builds their crib using shady schemes, and their hangouts with ill-gotten gains; who swipes their neighbor's services without paying up, and doesn't give them their due for their hustle."
Jeremiah,22,14,"They're like, 'I'm gonna build myself a sick crib with super spacious rooms, and I'm gonna have big windows that let in all the natural light.' And they're gonna make sure it looks all fancy with cedar ceilings and vibrant vermilion paint."
Jeremiah,22,15,"Just because you have a fancy lifestyle and surround yourself with luxury, does that mean you'll be a successful leader? Your father had a humble life, focused on fairness and integrity, and everything went well for him."
Jeremiah,22,16,"He had the backs of the poor and needy, and dude, life was good for him. Like, wasn't this his way of really getting me? That's straight from the big man upstairs."
Jeremiah,22,17,"But your focus and intention are solely driven by greed, harming those who are innocent, suppressing others, and engaging in violence without reason."
Jeremiah,22,18,"Yo, listen up! This is what God's gotta say 'bout Jehoiakim, Josiah's son and king of Judah. No one's gonna be crying over him, like, 'Oh, my bro!' or 'Oh, sis!' Nah, nobody's gonna be crying like, 'Oh, lord!' or talking 'bout his awesomeness!"
Jeremiah,22,19,"He will be buried like a donkey, dragged and tossed beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,22,20,"Head to Lebanon and start screaming, shout out in Bashan, let your voice be heard throughout the land; because all of your crushes have been totally wrecked."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I tried talking to you when things were going well for you, but you were like, 'Nah, I'm not listening.' This has been your pattern since you were young, always ignoring what I had to say."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind will totally wipe out all your leaders, and your crushes will end up being captured. That's when you're gonna feel so embarrassed and humiliated for all the messed up things you've done."
Jeremiah,22,23,"Yo, person living in Lebanon, chillin' in those fancy cedar trees, you better brace yourself ‘cause when the pain hits you, it'll feel like a woman in labor! Trust, it won't be a walk in the park!"
Jeremiah,22,24,"Swear to God, yo, even if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, was like my main accessory on my right hand, I'd still snatch him away, no cap."
Jeremiah,22,25,"And I'll totally let those squad who wanna take you out catch you, and also the ones whose vibes make you extra scared, yeah, even Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans, too."
Jeremiah,22,26,"And I'm sending you out, along with your mom who brought you into this world, to a totally different country where you weren't even born. Yeah, that's where you're gonna meet your end."
Jeremiah,22,27,"But like, even if they really wanna go back to the place they left, they won't be able to. You know, they can have their hearts set on it, but it's just not gonna happen. {desire: Hebrew term for like, having their minds all fixated on something}"
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this dude Coniah, like, totally disrespected and worthless? Is he like a useless tool that no one wants? Why are they all kicked out, him and his fam, and thrown into a place they don't even know?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"Yo, earth, listen up three times, 'cause the LORD's got some word for ya."
Jeremiah,22,30,"God's like, 'Listen up, this guy is not gonna have any kids and he won't succeed in life. None of his descendants will ever be kings of David's line and rule over Judah.'"
Jeremiah,23,1,"It's a major bummer for those leaders who wreck and scatter the sheep of my crew! Says the LORD, you know."
Jeremiah,23,2,"So like, listen up. This is what the big man upstairs, the LORD God of Israel, has to say about those pastors who are supposed to be taking care of my people. You guys have totally messed up. You scattered my flock, drove them away, and didn't even bother to check up on them. Well, guess what? You're about to get a taste of your own medicine. The LORD said it, and He's gonna make sure you pay for the messed-up things you've done."
Jeremiah,23,3,"And I'm gonna bring back all the leftover peeps from different places I sent 'em, and I'll bring 'em home to their fams. They'll thrive and level up big time."
Jeremiah,23,4,"Yo, I'm gonna appoint some awesome leaders to take care of them and make sure they're well-fed. They won't have to stress or worry anymore, no more lacking. This is the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,5,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says brace yourselves, 'cause there's a coming day when I'll raise up a totally righteous leader from David's fam. This King is gonna rule and succeed, bringing true justice and fairness to the whole earth."
Jeremiah,23,6,"During his reign, Judah will be blessed with salvation, and Israel will live securely. He will be known as THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. ({THE LORD...: In Hebrew, Jehovahtsidkenu})"
Jeremiah,23,7,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs, aka the LORD, is letting you in on a little secret. A time will come when people won't be saying stuff like, 'Yo, the LORD totally saved the Israelites from Egypt!'"
Jeremiah,23,8,"Yo, the LORD is legit the one who rescued and guided the descendants of Israel outta the north country and all the places where they were scattered. And now, they gonna chill in their own land, no doubt."
Jeremiah,23,9,"Dude, my heart is totally shattered because of those prophets! I'm so shook, like my bones are legit trembling. I feel like I'm wasted, you know, like completely overwhelmed by the LORD and His super holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"The whole place is full of cheaters and liars; because people are always cussing, the land is all sad and messed up. The beautiful spots in nature are all dried up and ruined, because everyone is doing evil things and using their power for the wrong reasons. (cussing can also mean cursing, and force can also mean violence)"
Jeremiah,23,11,"You won't believe it, but even the so-called prophetss' and priestss' have been acting so uncool and disrespectful. It's like, seriously? They've been doing some really messed up stuff right here in my house, declares the almighty LORD."
Jeremiah,23,12,"So, like, their path is gonna be super sketchy in the dark: they're gonna be totally lost and end up falling into it. 'Cause I'm gonna bring some serious bad vibes their way, when it's time for them to face the consequences, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,13,"So, like, I totally witnessed some major facepalm moments with those Samaria prophets. They were all up in that Baal hype, leading my peeps from Israel astray. Can you believe it? Talk about a major fail! 😳 {folly: or, an absurd thing: Heb. unsavoury}"
Jeremiah,23,14,"Yo, I peeped some messed up stuff happening with the prophets in Jerusalem - it's straight up horrifying. These dudes be cheating on their partners, spreading lies left and right. Plus, they be supporting the bad guys, making sure nobody turns away from their wicked ways. To me, they're all like Sodom and its people, or even Gomorrah. Real talk."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of all the cool kids has to say about those prophets. Check it out, I'm gonna serve them a bitter dose of wormwood and make them chug down some seriously bitter water. Why? Because these prophets from Jerusalem are spreading out some major fakeness all over the place, like, seriously everywhere. And we can't have that vibe in the land, you know?!"
Jeremiah,23,16,"Yo, listen up, the big man upstairs says don't pay attention to those fake prophets who act all high and mighty. They just talk nonsense, coming straight from their own imagination, not from God himself."
Jeremiah,23,17,"To those who reject me, they keep saying, Godd says you'll be chill, no worries.' And to everyone who follows their own desires, they assure, 'No bad vibes will come your way.'"
Jeremiah,23,18,"Like, who's been in the loop with the LORD and totally understood what He's been saying? Who's been paying attention to His words and really heard them, you know? Like, stayed in the know and actually listened to Him?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Yo, check it out, the LORD is unleashing a furious whirlwind, like super intense. It's gonna come crashing down hard on the wicked, no joke."
Jeremiah,23,20,"God's anger won't cool down until He carries out His plans and fulfills His desires. In the future, you'll totally get it, trust me."
Jeremiah,23,21,"I didn't even send these prophets, but they still went on running their mouths. I never even told them anything, but they kept on going with their so-called prophecies."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But yo, if they had just chilled with me and helped spread my truth to my people, they could've totally helped them change their wicked ways and ditch all the messed up stuff they were doing."
Jeremiah,23,23,"Bruh, I'm not some local deity, says the LORD. I'm worldwide, no distance can keep me away."
Jeremiah,23,24,"Like, can anyone actually hide in, like, some secret spot where I won't notice? Says the LORD. Uh, hello? I like totally fill up the whole heaven and earth, okay? Says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,25,"So, like, I've heard what those prophets are spewing; they claim to speak in my name, but it's all fake news. They're like, 'I had this totally unreal dream, man, like twice!'"
Jeremiah,23,26,"Like, seriously, how much longer are these fake prophets gonna keep spreading lies and stuff? Like, they're just following their own deceitful hearts, man."
Jeremiah,23,27,"There are those who try to make my peeps forget my name by spreading their dreams to everyone around them, just like their ancestors forgot my name for Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"For those who have a dream, go ahead and share it; and for those who have received my word, speak it with honesty. Seriously, what's the point of talking about worthless stuff when there's something valuable right in front of you? That's what the LORD says."
Jeremiah,23,29,"Yo, you all ready for this? Check it - ain't my word like straight up fire? The Lord be saying it's like a hammer smashing that rock into pieces!"
Jeremiah,23,30,"So, listen up, y'all! God's like, totally not cool with these prophets who straight-up steal each other's words, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Listen up, peeps! God's got a bone to pick with those prophets who talk the talk but don't walk the walk. They claim to speak for Him, but it's all smooth talk, not the real deal."
Jeremiah,23,32,"Yo, listen up! I'm totally not cool with those peeps who keep spreading fake dreams, declares the LORD. They're messing with my people, leading them astray with their lies and carelessness. But hey, just so you know, I never sent them or told them to do any of that. So, yeah, they're not gonna benefit my people in any way, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,33,"And if these people, or the prophet, or a priest, come to you and ask, like, 'What does the LORD want from us, yo?' then you gotta tell them, 'What are you talking about? I'm done with you, says the LORD.'"
Jeremiah,23,34,"And like, if there are these peeps - the prophet, the priest, or anyone in the crowd - who start claiming that they've got some kind of heavy message from the big man upstairs, I ain't gonna let 'em off the hook. Trust me, I'll make sure they get what they deserve, and their whole fam will feel the consequences too."
Jeremiah,23,35,"So like, tell your friend and your bro to be like, 'Yo, what did the LORD say, and what did He spit out?'"
Jeremiah,23,36,"You don't gotta talk about how the LORD burdens us anymore. Like, everyone's words will carry their own weight, ya know? 'Cause y'all messed up by twisting the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,"So, like, when you talk to a prophet, you gotta be like, 'Yo, what did the LORD say to you? What kind of message did He drop?'"
Jeremiah,23,38,"But yo, since y'all be sayin', 'Oh, the LORD's got a heavy load on His back,' let me break it down for ya. The LORD's like, 'Hold up, hold up, cuz! I already told y'all not to go around sayin', 'Oh, the LORD's got a heavy load on His back.'"
Jeremiah,23,39,"So, listen up, I'm gonna straight up ditch you and peace out. It's not just you, though - I'm also gonna bail on the city I hooked you and your ancestors up with, and kick you outta my sight."
Jeremiah,23,40,"And I'm gonna totally bring the ultimate embarrassment on you, like, forever and ever! It's gonna be, like, a shame that's gonna stick with you, and trust me, it ain't gonna be forgotten."
Jeremiah,24,1,"So, yo, the LORD was like, 'Check this out!' And I saw two baskets of figs in front of the LORD's temple. This was after Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, captured Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, who was the king of Judah, along with the other leaders, carpenters, and blacksmiths from Jerusalem. They all got brought to Babylon."
Jeremiah,24,2,"So, like, one of the baskets had these super tasty figs, you know, all perfectly ripe and stuff. But, dang, the other basket had some seriously rotten figs that were totally inedible, like, so bad you couldn't even take a bite. (Seriously, they were that bad!)"
Jeremiah,24,3,"So God was like, 'Yo Jeremiah, what do you see, bro?' And I was like, 'Dude, I see some figs. Like, some are legit awesome, like top-tier good vibes. But then there are others that are straight-up messed up, like seriously terrible. Can't even eat those, man. They're THAT bad."
Jeremiah,24,4,"So like, the LORD hit me up again, like, 'Bruh, listen to this'"
Jeremiah,24,5,"Yo, says the Lord, the God of Israel: Just like these lit figs, I'm gonna recognize those who got taken captive from Judah and sent to Chaldea. Don't trip, I did it for their own good, ya feel me?"
Jeremiah,24,6,"Because, like, I'm totally gonna keep an eye on them for good vibes, and I'm gonna bring them back to this chill land. I'm gonna give them an upgrade, not a teardown. Plus, I'm gonna plant them and make sure they don't get uprooted."
Jeremiah,24,7,"And I'll give them a heart to know me, that I'm the LORD. They'll be my homies, and I'll be their God, 'cause they'll come back to me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"And like, you know those gross figs that are totally inedible? They're like, super evil, seriously. God's saying, 'Yeah, I'm totally gonna make Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and all his fancy people, and the rest of the folks hanging out in Jerusalem or Egypt, face some serious consequences.'"
Jeremiah,24,9,"And I'll totally scatter them across all the kingdoms in the world, bringing them pain and making them a laughingstock, a joke, and a curse wherever they end up. This is gonna be a total hassle, but it's gonna happen. Trust."
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I'll unleash some serious chaos - swords, famine, and diseases - on them until they're wiped out from the land that I blessed their ancestors with."
Jeremiah,25,1,"This is what God said to Jeremiah about everyone in Judah during the fourth year of Jehoiakim, who was the son of Josiah and the king of Judah. It happened in the same year that Nebuchadnezzar became the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,25,2,"Yo, listen up y'all! Jeremiah, the prophet, had some major stuff to say to all the peeps in Judah and Jerusalem. He was like:"
Jeremiah,25,3,"Since Josiah, son of Amon, became king of Judah 13 years ago, up until now (that's the 23rd year), the word of the LORD has been coming to me and I've been speaking to you, making the effort to rise early and deliver the message. But you haven't been paying attention."
Jeremiah,25,4,"Yo, the LORD straight up sent all his servants, the prophets, to you. He woke up early and sent them, but y'all didn't listen, or even bother to pay attention."
Jeremiah,25,5,"They were like, 'Yo, listen up! It's time for all y'all to bounce back from your messed up ways and the bad stuff you've been doing. Instead, live in this land that the LORD has blessed you and your ancestors with forever and ever."
Jeremiah,25,6,"Don't chase after other gods, thinking they're worth your time and attention. Don't get all wrapped up in idol worship and make me furious by your own creations. If you keep it real with me, I won't do anything to harm you, fam."
Jeremiah,25,7,"But you didn't listen to me, says the LORD, and that just made me mad when you messed things up for yourselves."
Jeremiah,25,8,"So listen up, this is what the LORD of epicness is saying: 'Yo, you guys haven't been paying attention to my words,'"
Jeremiah,25,9,"Check it out, fam! Imma slide into the north and swipe all the families, says the LORD. Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, gonna be my ride-or-die, and together we gonna come at this land, the people living here, and even all them other nations nearby. We gonna wipe 'em out completely, leaving 'em all shook, getting hissed at, and turning everything into a never-ending wasteland."
Jeremiah,25,10,"And I'm gonna silence their laughter, joy, wedding celebrations, the sounds of grinding mills, and the light of candles. #SorryNotSorry #GoneWithTheSound"
Jeremiah,25,11,"And like, this entire land will totally be wrecked, man. It's gonna be like, a total shocker and stuff. These other nations, they're gonna be like, servin' the king of Babylon for a solid seventy years, dude."
Jeremiah,25,12,"So like, in the future, after like seventy years, there's gonna be some serious consequences for the king of Babylon and his whole nation, according to what the LORD says. It's all because of their wrongdoing and the messed up state of the land of the Chaldeans. It's gonna be like a never-ending desolation, you know?!"
Jeremiah,25,13,"And I'll totally drop all my truths on that place, just like everything I wrote in this book that Jeremiah spilled about every nation."
Jeremiah,25,14,"So, like, many nations and super influential peeps will totally use them for their own benefit, ya know? And I'm gonna give them exactly what they deserve based on what they've done and all the stuff they've made with their own hands."
Jeremiah,25,15,"Yo, the LORD God of Israel came to me and was like, 'Take this mad angry wine cup from me and make all the nations you go to drink it.'"
Jeremiah,25,16,"And they're gonna be totally shook and lose it when they sip on their drinks, 'cause they'll be tripping out from the chaos I'm unleashing with my sword."
Jeremiah,25,17,"So, I grabbed the cup that the LORD handed to me and made all the nations take a sip, the ones the LORD sent me to."
Jeremiah,25,18,"Basically, Jerusalem and all those towns in Judah, along with their rulers and leaders, are gonna be ruined, shock everyone, be laughed at and despised, like, forever."
Jeremiah,25,19,"Yo, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, his squad, his homies, and all his peeps;"
Jeremiah,25,20,"And like, all the people from different backgrounds, and like, all the rulers of the land of Uz, and all the big shots from the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remaining peeps from Ashdod,"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Yo, Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites,"
Jeremiah,25,22,"And like, all the hype kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and these kings of the lit isles across the sea, you know, the ones by the coast and stuff."
Jeremiah,25,23,"Yo, Dedan, Tema, Buz, and everyone chillin' in the far corners, representin' with fresh cuts on the sides of their hair."
Jeremiah,25,24,"And like, all the kings of Arabia, and all those mixed people who live in the desert, ya know?"
Jeremiah,25,25,"And like, all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,"
Jeremiah,25,26,"And like, all the kings from up north, both near and far, right? And all the cool kingdoms all around the world, like literally everywhere on this planet, you know? And then, the king of Sheshach is gonna have his drink right after them, dude."
Jeremiah,25,27,"So, like, tell them this, God is saying this: get your drink on and party hard, but then you're gonna feel sick and crash and you won't be able to get back up. It's 'cause there's gonna be some serious trouble coming your way, like a sword. Real talk."
Jeremiah,25,28,"And if they're not down to take the cup from you, you gotta tell 'em, this is what the LORD of hosts says: y'all gonna drink it, fo sho."
Jeremiah,25,29,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to bring some serious trouble to the city repping my name. Don't think you're gonna get away with it, though. No way! I'm calling for a straight-up sword to mess with every single person living on this planet, according to the Lord of all armies. Bet!"
Jeremiah,25,30,"Yo, spill the tea and drop some truth on all of 'em. Let 'em know the LORD gonna make some noise, straight up, hollerin' from His holy place. He 'bout to go all out, like stompin' grapes, makin' a bang that'll reach all over the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"Get ready, 'cause the whole world's gonna hear a loud commotion! The big man upstairs, you know, the LORD, he's got some beef with the nations. He's gonna lay down the law with all humanity! The wicked ones don't stand a chance, 'cause the LORD's gonna bring the sword down on 'em. That's straight from the LORD himself, no cap."
Jeremiah,25,32,"Yo, this is what the LORD of hosts is sayin': Listen up, peeps! Bad stuff is gonna spread like crazy from one nation to another, and a massive whirlwind is gonna kick up from all sides of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"And on that day, people will be killed by the LORD from one end of the earth to the other. There won't be any mourning, gathering, or burial for them; they will just lie on the ground like wasteful trash."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Yo, shepherds, it's time to let out your feelings and start crying; even you, the leaders of the flock, should get down and dirty in the ashes. The days of your destruction and scattering are over; you're about to fall hard like a highly sought-after item. Yeah, it's happening."
Jeremiah,25,35,"And the shepherds won't be able to make a run for it, and the leaders of the flock won't be able to get away."
Jeremiah,25,36,"You're about to hear some serious commotion from the shepherds and major chaos within the flock, because the Lord has totally wrecked their cozy grazing spot."
Jeremiah,25,37,"And like, the chill places where people live are getting wrecked because the LORD is seriously ticked off."
Jeremiah,25,38,"He's left his hiding place like a boss lion, because their land is totally wrecked from the intense brutality of the oppressor and his furious anger. {desolate: Torn apart and ruined}"
Jeremiah,26,1,"So, like, at the start of Jehoiakim's rule, when he was the son of Josiah who was king of Judah, this message from the LORD went down, like,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"Yo, God's like, listen up! Get yourself to the main spot in God's crib and spread this message to all the cities of Judah. They're all coming to worship in God's place, so make sure you tell 'em exactly what I'm telling you. Don't leave out anything, got it?"
Jeremiah,26,3,"If they actually listen and each person turns away from their wrongdoings, then I might change my mind about the bad stuff I was gonna do to them as a consequence of their wicked actions."
Jeremiah,26,4,"So, listen up and pay attention! This is what the big guy upstairs says: If you don't wanna listen to me and follow my rules that I laid out for you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"To listen to what my servants the prophets have to say, I've been sending them messages from dawn to dusk, but you haven't been paying attention;"
Jeremiah,26,6,"I'll totally wreck this place, turning it into a total disaster that'll bring bad juju upon all nations!"
Jeremiah,26,7,"So, like, everyone, from the priests and the prophets to all the people in the house of the LORD, totally heard Jeremiah drop these words."
Jeremiah,26,8,"So, basically, when Jeremiah finished saying everything the LORD told him to say to everyone, the priests, the prophets, and all the people grabbed him and were like, 'You're definitely gonna die, bro.'"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Yo, why you out here speaking in the name of the LORD, saying this crib gonna be trashed like Shiloh and this city gonna be empty with no one livin' in it? And all the people be gatherin' against Jeremiah up in the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the cool peeps of Judah heard all of this, they bounced from the king's crib to the crib of the LORD, and chilled at the entrance of the fresh gate of the LORD's crib. (At the door, ya know.)"
Jeremiah,26,11,"So, like, the priests and the prophets, they went up to the princes and all the people, and they were like, 'Yo, this guy deserves to be punished! He's been prophesying against our city, just like you've heard with your own ears!' Yeah, they were talking about executing him and stuff, like, serious judgment of death kind of thing."
Jeremiah,26,12,"So then Jeremiah started talking to all the leaders and all the people, and he said, 'Yo, the Almighty One sent me to drop some truth bombs on this crib and this whole city. I'm here to speak all the words that y'all have been hearing.'"
Jeremiah,26,13,"So, like, it's time to change up your whole vibe and the stuff you do, and just listen to what the LORD your God is saying, ya know? And if you do, the LORD will totally chill out and take back all the bad stuff He said was gonna happen to you, no cap."
Jeremiah,26,14,"So like, I completely trust you and I'm ready for whatever you have planned. You know what's best for me, and I'm cool with that. Whatever you think is right, just go for it."
Jeremiah,26,15,"Yo, listen up! If you go ahead and kill me, you're gonna be responsible for innocent bloodshed, not to mention the whole city and its people. I'm just keeping it real - the LORD sent me to deliver this message directly to you loud and clear."
Jeremiah,26,16,"So, like, the leaders and everyone were all like, talking to the priests and prophets, you know? And they were all like, 'This dude doesn't deserve to be killed, man. 'Cause he was speaking to us in the name of the LORD our God, you feel me?'"
Jeremiah,26,17,"So, like, a bunch of the older dudes in the land stood up and started talking to the whole crowd of people, you know, like, the assembly, and this is what they said,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"So, check it, Micah, this dude from Morasthite, he was prophesying when Hezekiah was king of Judah, and he straight up spoke to all the people of Judah, like, listen up! This is what the LORD of hosts said: Zion is gonna get totally plowed like a field, and Jerusalem is gonna turn into a bunch of heaps, while the mountain of the house will be like high places in a forest."
Jeremiah,26,19,"Yo, did Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all his peeps actually kill that dude? Nah man, Hezekiah was shook, he feared the LORD and prayed to Him, and the LORD changed His mind about bringing down some bad stuff on them. So, like, we better watch out, 'cause we could bring some major trouble upon ourselves, ya feel me?"
Jeremiah,26,20,"There was this dude named Urijah, son of Shemaiah from Kirjathjearim. He was all about prophesying in the name of the LORD, and he straight-up spoke against this city and land, just like Jeremiah did."
Jeremiah,26,21,"So, like, when King Jehoiakim and his whole squad, including all the high-ranking peeps, heard what this guy was saying, the king wanted to straight up take him out. But when Urijah heard about it, he got scared and dip out, heading straight to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,"So the king, Jehoiakim, decided to send some dudes to Egypt. He picked this guy named Elnathan, who's the son of Achbor, and a few other guys to go with him to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,23,"So they got Urijah out of Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim. And guess what? The king straight up killed him with a sword and threw his lifeless body into some regular ol' graves. That's it, just graves for the everyday folks."
Jeremiah,26,24,"But Ahikam, Shaphan's son, had Jeremiah's back, making sure no one got to him and killed him."
Jeremiah,27,1,"So like, at the start of Jehoiakim's rule over Judah, Jeremiah got this message from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,27,2,"So God is like, 'Yo, listen up. I want you to make some chains and put them around your neck, okay? Like, this is what the Lord wants.'"
Jeremiah,27,3,"And DM them to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammonites, Tyrus, and Zidon, through the messengers who slide into Jerusalem and hit up Zedekiah, the king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Tell them to message their masters like this: God, the big boss of the Israelites, says to let the masters know this, like when you text them:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"I totally created the earth, humans, and animals that are chillin' on the ground, flexing my power and strength. I gave it all to whoever I thought was deserving, no cap."
Jeremiah,27,6,"Yo, I just hooked Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, up with all these lands. He's my servant, so I gave him the animals of the field too, to help him out and stuff."
Jeremiah,27,7,"And like, all the nations will totally like, serve him, his son, and his son's son, until, like, the time when his land finally arrives, you know? And then, like, lots of other nations and super powerful kings will totally take advantage of him and like, do their own thing."
Jeremiah,27,8,"Yo, listen up! Here's the deal: Any nation or kingdom that refuses to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and won't bow down to him, they're gonna get punished, alright? The LORD says He's gonna bring some serious pain their way - swords, famines, and diseases, you name it. Basically, they're gonna get wiped out, all because they didn't wanna show some respect to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,9,"So, like, don't listen to those prophets or diviners or dreamers or enchanters or sorcerers who are telling you not to serve the king of Babylon, you know? They're just talkin' dreams and stuff."
Jeremiah,27,10,"Yo, listen up! These peeps be straight up lying to you, trying to distance you from your homeland. They want me to kick you out and cause your total destruction."
Jeremiah,27,11,"Yo, listen up! If those nations be cool with bowing down to the king of Babylon and doing his bidding, then I'm gonna let 'em stay in their land, says the LORD. They can keep doing their thing, farming and living there and all."
Jeremiah,27,12,"So, like, I totally talked to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and I was like, 'Yo dude, listen up! You gotta surrender to the king of Babylon, put yourself in his service, and live your best life, man!'"
Jeremiah,27,13,"Bruh, seriously? Why you gotta risk your life and your whole squad's life, getting wrecked by swords, hunger, and sickness? God already warned the nation that refuses to serve Babylon's king. Don't be dumb, yo!"
Jeremiah,27,14,"So like, don't even listen to those prophets who are all like, 'Dude, don't serve the king of Babylon,' 'cause they're totally spreading fake news, man."
Jeremiah,27,15,"Yo, I didn't even send those dudes, says the LORD, but they out here straight up spittin' fake prophecies in My name. They tryna get you all kicked out and end up destroyed, along with the false prophets who be prophesyin' to ya."
Jeremiah,27,16,"So, I had a chat with the priests and all the people and I said, 'Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD says: Don't pay attention to those prophets of yours who keep spouting off and saying, 'Hey guys, guess what? The LORD's stuff is totally gonna come back real soon from Babylon!' But let me tell you, they're lying straight to your faces, fam.'"
Jeremiah,27,17,"Don't listen to them, just do your thing and go with the flow. Serve the top dog, the king of Babylon, and you'll be chillin' and livin' the good life. Seriously, why should this city get wrecked?"
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they claim to be prophets and if they really have the word of the LORD with them, then they should pray to the LORD of hosts. They need to ask Him to make sure that the sacred items in the house of the LORD, as well as in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem, don't end up in Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,19,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of hosts has to say about those fancy pillars, that big ol' sea, the bases, and all the other stuff still chillin' in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, snatched up Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim and the king of Judah, along with all the fancy peeps from Judah and Jerusalem, when he dragged them away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,21,"Listen up, the big boss, God of Israel, has something to say about those fancy items chillin' in the house of the LORD, and also in the crib of the king of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,22,"They will be taken to Babylon, and they'll stay there until the day I come to see them, says the LORD. Then, I'll bring them back here and give them back what belongs to them."
Jeremiah,28,1,"So, like, in that same year, when Zedekiah was king of Judah, in the fourth year, you know, in the fifth month, this dude named Hananiah, who was a prophet from Gibeon, came up to me in the house of the LORD, in front of all the priests and the crowd, and started talking to me. Can you even believe it?"
Jeremiah,28,2,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Almighty, the God of Israel, is sayin': 'I straight up shattered the king of Babylon's control!'"
Jeremiah,28,3,"In just two years, I'll bring back all the sacred stuff that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon snatched from the Lord's house and took to Babylon. (Just saying, those two years are like regular, normal human years.)"
Jeremiah,28,4,"And I will totally bring back Jeconiah, Jehoiakim's son and the king of Judah, along with all the Judah peeps who got taken to Babylon, says the LORD. It's gonna be lit because I'm gonna smash the king of Babylon's control over them. {captives: or people}"
Jeremiah,28,5,"So Jeremiah, the prophet, was like, talking to Hananiah, another prophet, in front of the priests, and all the peeps who were chillin' in the house of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,28,6,"Jeremiah the prophet was like, Wordd! The LORD gonna make it happen! He's gonna do exactly what you said and bring back all the stuff from the LORD'S house and all the people who were taken captive to Babylon, right here in this place.'"
Jeremiah,28,7,"But like, listen up to what I gotta say, both to you and everyone else here;"
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets that came before me and before you long ago predicted trouble, chaos, and disease on many nations and powerful empires."
Jeremiah,28,9,The prophet who talks about peace will only be known as legit if what they say actually happens. That's when we'll know for sure that the LORD has sent them.
Jeremiah,28,10,"So, like, this prophet dude Hananiah, he straight-up took the yoke off of Jeremiah's neck and broke it, you know."
Jeremiah,28,11,"Then Hananiah said with all the people around, like, Godd says, I'll totally free all the countries from the control of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, within, like, two years tops. And Jeremiah just bounced after that."
Jeremiah,28,12,"So, like, after Hananiah broke the yoke off Jeremiah's neck, the LORD dropped some words on Jeremiah, you know what I'm saying? This happened, like, when Hananiah called himself a prophet."
Jeremiah,28,13,"Yo, go and deliver this message to Hananiah, okay? Here's what the LORD says: You think you're all cool, breaking those wooden yokes? Well, guess what? You'll be making them yokes out of iron instead."
Jeremiah,28,14,"Yo, the Almighty God of Israel speaks up and drops a truth bomb. I laid down a heavy burden on all these nations, making them do the bidding of King Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon. They gotta serve him, no questions asked. And hey, I even handed over the animals in the wilderness to him. It's the real deal."
Jeremiah,28,15,"So, like, Jeremiah was all like, 'Yo, Hananiah, listen up! The Lord totally didn't send you, man. You're just spreading fake vibes and leading people astray, dude."
Jeremiah,28,16,"So, like, God's saying, listen up: I'm totally about to kick you outta this place, like, off the face of the earth, ya know? Yeah, this year is gonna be the end of you 'cause you've been spreading rebellion and going against the Lord. {rebellion: Hebrew for revolt, FYI}"
Jeremiah,28,17,"So, like, Hananiah the prophet totally kicked the bucket in the same year, you know, in the seventh month."
Jeremiah,29,1,"So, like, here's the deal: Jeremiah the prophet sent this letter from Jerusalem to all the peeps who got taken as prisoners, you know, the elders, priests, prophets, and everyone else Nebuchadnezzar snatched up from Jerusalem and brought to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"So, like, after Jeconiah the king, the queen, and all those important people – you know, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the carpenters, and the smiths – skedaddled from Jerusalem... Oh, and by the way, eunuchs can also be called chamberlains. Just FYI."
Jeremiah,29,3,"So, like, Elasah (Shaphan's son) and Gemariah (Hilkiah's son), who were sent by Zedekiah, the king of Judah, to Babylon to see Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, they delivered this message:"
Jeremiah,29,4,"Yo homies, listen up! This is what the LORD, the ultimate boss of all, the God of Israel, is saying to all y'all who got snatched up and taken as prisoners by me from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,5,"Yo fam, go ahead and construct some lit houses, find your #HomeGoals and make it cozy. Don't forget to flex on those gardens too, grow some mad plants and enjoy the juicy fruits that come with it. #GardenGoals"
Jeremiah,29,6,"Yo, get yourself some wives and start having kids. Also, find wives for your sons and arrange marriages for your daughters, so they can have their own children. The goal is to increase in numbers, not to decrease, ya know?"
Jeremiah,29,7,"Yo, make an effort to promote peace in the city where you're currently living as exiles, and pray to the LORD for it. 'Cause, like, when the city is peaceful, you'll also experience that chill peace vibe."
Jeremiah,29,8,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of all the cool kids, the God of Israel, has to say: Don't let those self-proclaimed prophetss' and 'diviners', who think they're all that, fool ya. And don't even pay attention to those dreams you make up in your head. They ain't worth your time, ya feel me?"
Jeremiah,29,9,"They're like, spreading lies in my name, but I totally didn't ask them to, says the LORD. #NotCool #NotMyProphets"
Jeremiah,29,10,"Yo, listen up! The LORD's like, 'Check it, after 70 years at Babylon, I'm gonna come through and make good on my promises. I'll bring you back to this place.'"
Jeremiah,29,11,"So, listen up fam, the big man upstairs is telling you straight up that He's got mad love for you. His thoughts for you are all about peace and good vibes, none of that evil junk. And get this, He's got big plans in store for you, things that you can totally look forward to. Trust me, He's got your back, always."
Jeremiah,29,12,"So like, when you're in a tough spot, you can totally hit me up, reach out, and talk to me, and I'll be all ears, ready to listen to whatever you have to say."
Jeremiah,29,13,"And like, if you're really, really on a mission to find me, you'll actually find me. Just put your whole heart into it, ya know?"
Jeremiah,29,14,"Yo, listen up, people! The LORD is saying that if you search for Him, you'll find Him. He'll free you from all the bad vibes, gather you from every corner of the world He scattered you, and bring you back to your home where you were taken away from."
Jeremiah,29,15,"Yo, we've been saying, like, God totally raised up some prophets among us while we're here in Babylon, you know?"
Jeremiah,29,16,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD has to say about the king who's chilling on David's throne, and all the peeps living in this city, and also your homies who didn't get taken away with you into captivity."
Jeremiah,29,17,"Yo, listen up! The LORD of hosts is sending some serious stuff their way. Brace yourselves for a combo of sword, famine, and pestilence. It's gonna be like those nasty figs that are totally disgusting to eat because they're super rotten and evil."
Jeremiah,29,18,"And I'll totally bring it on with intense problems, hunger, and sickness, and I'll scatter them all over the world, turning them into a total joke and embarrassment to everyone. Like seriously, people will be like, 'OMG, can you believe what happened to them?!' Yeah, it's gonna be a major struggle for them, for real!"
Jeremiah,29,19,"Because they haven't listened to what I've been saying, says the LORD. I've been sending my prophets to deliver my message, waking up early just to make sure they hear it. But you guys just didn't want to listen, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,20,"Listen up, everyone in captivity! I, the LORD, have sent you from Jerusalem to Babylon, so pay attention!"
Jeremiah,29,21,"Yo, listen up fam, this is what the Almighty God of Israel has to say. Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, they out here spreading fake prophecies in my name. But I'm telling you, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, gonna get 'em. He gonna straight up slay them right before your eyes, no cap."
Jeremiah,29,22,"And all those captives from the land of Judah who are in Babylon will bring you bad vibes, saying, 'I hope the Lord makes you as unlucky as Zedekiah and Ahab, who got totally roasted by the king of Babylon!'"
Jeremiah,29,23,"Yo, these people in Israel be doing some wicked stuff. They out here cheating with their neighbors' spouses and straight up making up lies in my name, but I never told them to do that! I see it all and I got the receipts, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,24,"Yo, so here's what you gotta tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, like, listen up. Nehelamite, aka dreamer, you feel me?"
Jeremiah,29,25,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has to say. So, check it, because you sent some letters in your name to all the peeps in Jerusalem, including Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, who's a priest, and to all the other priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"God has chosen you to be the priest, taking the place of Jehoiada. He wants you to serve as officials in His house, especially when dealing with those who claim to be prophets but are just acting crazy. Your responsibility is to lock them up and keep them in check."
Jeremiah,29,27,"So like, why haven't you confronted Jeremiah of Anathoth yet? He's out here claiming to be a prophet for you guys!"
Jeremiah,29,28,"So he messaged us in Babylon, like, 'Yo, this captivity is gonna be a long one. Build yourselves some dope houses, live in 'em, and start planting gardens to enjoy the fruits of your labor.'"
Jeremiah,29,29,"So like, Zephaniah the priest totally read this letter out loud to Jeremiah the prophet. Like, he wanted everybody to hear it and stuff."
Jeremiah,29,30,"So, like, God spoke to Jeremiah and was all like,"
Jeremiah,29,31,"Yo, listen up all y'all who are in captivity! The LORD has a message for Shemaiah the Nehelamite. He's been out here prophesying to you all, but here's the scoop: I didn't actually send him, and he's just leading you astray with his false promises, smh."
Jeremiah,29,32,"So, this is what the LORD is saying: Yo, listen up! I'm about to bring some serious consequences upon Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his fam. They ain't gonna have a single person living among the people anymore, and they won't even get to witness the amazing things I'm gonna do for my peeps, says the LORD. Why? 'Cause dude had the guts to teach others to go against me. Like, seriously?"
Jeremiah,30,1,"So, like, the Lord totally spoke to Jeremiah and was all like,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"Yo, this is the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, telling you to jot down all the stuff I've said to you in a book."
Jeremiah,30,3,"Listen up, peeps! God's sayin' that there will come a time when the captivity of His peeps, Israel and Judah, will be over. He's gonna make 'em return to the land He gave their ancestors, and they gonna own it, no doubt!"
Jeremiah,30,4,"So God was like, 'Yo, listen up fam, I got something to say about Israel and Judah'."
Jeremiah,30,5,"Yo, the LORD is like, 'Check it, I'm hearing some serious trembling and fear vibes, no peace in sight. Fear is dominating the scene, peace ain't even in the equation.'"
Jeremiah,30,6,"Yo, like, check it out, have you ever seen a dude going through labor pains? Why do all the dudes have their hands on their lower abdomen, looking all pale like a woman in labor? (BTW, when it says mann,' it means a male person)"
Jeremiah,30,7,"OMG, that day is gonna be insane, like, totally one-of-a-kind! It's gonna be a super rough time for Jacob, but don't stress - he's gonna make it out safe and sound!"
Jeremiah,30,8,"Yo, listen up! When that day comes, says the mighty LORD, I'm gonna free you from all the heavy stuff holding you back. Your chains will be shattered, and no more outsiders will take advantage of you anymore."
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they gonna be vibin' with the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I'm gonna bring back for them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"So don't stress, dude Jacob, says the LORD; don't be bummed out, Israel: 'cause check this, I'm gonna rescue you from a distance, and your descendants from the place they're all locked up; and Jacob's gonna come back, find some peace and chill, and nobody's gonna mess with him, for real."
Jeremiah,30,11,"I got your back, says the LORD, to save you: even though I'm gonna wipe out all the nations I sent you to, I won't wipe you out completely though: I'll give you a reality check, but won't leave you completely unscathed."
Jeremiah,30,12,"So, this is what the LORD says, your injury is impossible to heal and your wound is really painful."
Jeremiah,30,13,"No one is there to back you up, to help you heal and fix things."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your friends have totally ghosted you; they don't even bother searching for you anymore. It's like I've totally wrecked you, hitting you with enemy-like wounds and brutal punishment, all because you've accumulated so many bad deeds and sins."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why are you crying over your problems? Your sadness won't go away because you've done so many wrong things. Your sins have piled up, so that's why you're experiencing all this."
Jeremiah,30,16,"So, basically, anyone who messes with you will totally get what's coming. All your haters will end up locked up, and all the ones who try to take advantage of you will end up being taken down. And those who think they can prey on you? Yeah, I'll totally turn the tables and make them the ones getting preyed upon. Be ready for some serious justice, fam!"
Jeremiah,30,17,"Yo, don't trip! The LORD's got you covered. He's gonna bring back your good vibes and totally fix you up when you're hurt. People may have been dissing you, calling you an Outcast and all, but guess what? They won't be saying that anymore, 'cause you're the real deal, a shining star that everyone's gonna be chasing after."
Jeremiah,30,18,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says, check this out, I'm gonna bring back Jacob's tents from captivity and show some love to his dwelling places. The city will be rebuilt on its own little hill, and the palace will stand strong, just like before!"
Jeremiah,30,19,"And they'll totally be all about the gratitude and having a blast, with voices filled with joy. I'll make sure there's a whole lot of them, not just a handful. Plus, I'll totally give them the recognition they deserve, and they won't be underestimated."
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their kids gonna be just like before, and their squad gonna be solid in front of me, and I'm gonna clap back at anyone who messes with them."
Jeremiah,30,21,"And their squad leaders will come from within their crew, and their boss will rise up among them; and I will make him come closer, and he will step up to me: for who is this person who's got the guts to draw near to me? says the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,22,"And y'all gonna be my squad, and I'm gonna be your main homie."
Jeremiah,30,23,"Check it out, the LORD's furious whirlwind is coming, like, non-stop spinning: it's gonna totally wreck the wicked, you know, like a major headache. {cutting: like, really intense} {fall...: or, stick around}"
Jeremiah,30,24,"God's intense anger won't cool down until He has fully completed His plans and fulfilled His intentions. When those final days come, you'll finally understand it."
Jeremiah,31,1,"Yo, the LORD himself be like, I'm gonna be the God for all the squads in Israel, and they gonna be my fam."
Jeremiah,31,2,"Yo, listen up! The word from the LORD is this: Those peeps who survived the sword found mad grace in the wilderness. I'm talking about Israel, when I took them to rest, y'know?"
Jeremiah,31,3,"OMG, let me spill the tea. The LORD has been there for me since forever, like, for real. He's like, 'Yo, I'm totally crushing on you with a love that lasts forever.' So, you know what? He's been all sweet and kind, like sliding into your DMs but in a super nice way."
Jeremiah,31,4,"I will rebuild you, girlboss! You'll be totally lit, O pure-hearted girl of Israel. You'll rock those beats and strut your stuff in the epic dance parties of the joyful squad. (tabrets = timbrels)"
Jeremiah,31,5,You'll totally flex by planting vines on the lit mountains of Samaria. The OG planters gonna do their thing and casually feast on those grapes like it's NBD.
Jeremiah,31,6,"Yo, listen up! There's gonna come a day when the watchmen on Mount Ephraim gonna be like, 'Yo, wake up and let's go to Zion, to the LORD our God.'"
Jeremiah,31,7,"Yo, listen up! The LORD is like, 'Yo, sing happy vibes for Jacob and make some noise among the top nations. Spread the word, give props, and say, 'O LORD, save your peeps, the leftover crew of Israel.'"
Jeremiah,31,8,"Yo, check it out, I'm gonna gather them peeps from the north country and all over the world. And guess what, I'm not gonna leave anyone behind - even the blind, the lame, the pregnant ladies, and those in labor. We gonna have a massive crew coming back together, no doubts."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They'll come crying, and I'll be there to guide them with their heartfelt requests. I'll lead them along peaceful rivers, making sure they stay on the right path without tripping. 'Cause hey, I'm like a dad to Israel, and Ephraim is my number one child."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Listen up, people from all over the world, and spread this message to those far away. Say this: The one who scattered Israel will gather them and protect them, just like a shepherd takes care of their flock."
Jeremiah,31,11,"Yo, the LORD totally saved Jacob, and like, rescued him from the grip of someone way stronger than him."
Jeremiah,31,12,"So they'll come and jam out in the awesome spot of Zion, and all join in for the blessings of the LORD, like crops, party drinks, fancy oils, and cute little animals: and their soul will be as refreshed as a lush garden; and they won't feel sad anymore, like at all."
Jeremiah,31,13,"And the virgin is gonna be so stoked to bust out some sick moves on the dance floor, with all the young and old homies getting down together. 'Cause I'm gonna take their sadness and flip it into pure joy, give 'em comfort, and turn their frowns upside down."
Jeremiah,31,14,"And I'll fill the priests with pure happiness, and my peeps will be totally content with the awesome things I do, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,15,"God said: Yo, there was some real heartbreaking stuff goin' on in Ramah. People were straight up crying and it was no joke. Rahel was bawlin' her eyes out for her kids and she just couldn't find any solace because her babies were gone."
Jeremiah,31,16,"Yo, listen up! God's got a message for you. Hold back those tears and keep your voice in check. Here's the deal: your hard work won't go unnoticed. God promises that you'll be rewarded, and those who were once your enemies won't have a hold on you for long. You'll come out on top, just wait and see!"
Jeremiah,31,17,"And yo, there's mad hope in the future, says the LORD, that your squad of children gonna bounce back to their own turf."
Jeremiah,31,18,"I totally heard Ephraim complaining like, 'Yo, you've been giving me a hard time and I've been taking it! It's like putting a wild bull in a harness, man. But you know what? If you guide me back on track, I'll totally go back. Cuz you, God, are my main homie."
Jeremiah,31,19,"I totally changed my ways and felt major regret. Once I learned the truth, I was like BAM and hit my thigh. I was so embarrassed and completely stunned because I had to face up to the consequences of my immature actions from the past."
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim, like, my favorite child? Is he, like, outta sight? 'Cause, like, even though I was kinda harsh on him before, I still totally remember him and it gets me all worked up inside. I'm totally gonna show him mad love, says the LORD. #nofilter"
Jeremiah,31,21,"Yo, mark your path and stack them piles high! Focus on the road you've traveled. Come back, O young one of Israel, come back to your cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"Yo, how much longer you gonna keep playin' around, you rebellious babe? 'Cause God just dropped a major bomb on Earth: A girl gonna take charge and outshine the dudes."
Jeremiah,31,23,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of all the cool squads, the God of Israel, has to say: In the land of Judah and its cities, people will keep talking like this when I bring back their freedom. God bless you, righteous place and holy mountain!"
Jeremiah,31,24,"In Judah and all its cities, there will be farmers and people who roam with their flocks."
Jeremiah,31,25,Because I've totally boosted the tired souls and given major relief to all the super sad souls.
Jeremiah,31,26,"So, like, I woke up and looked around, and dude, my sleep was totally chill."
Jeremiah,31,27,"Yo, listen up! God says that there's gonna be some epic days ahead. He's gonna spread some serious blessings on the people of Israel and Judah. It's gonna be like scattering the seeds of both humans and animals. Can't wait, it's gonna be lit!"
Jeremiah,31,28,"And it's gonna go down like this - just like how I've been keeping an eye on them, tearing down, destroying, and causing trouble, I'll continue to watch over them, this time to build and bring growth, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,29,"In that time, people won't be saying anymore, 'It's the parents' fault that we're suffering consequences!' because they know that blaming others won't solve their own problems."
Jeremiah,31,30,But everyone will suffer the consequences of their own mistakes: anyone who indulges in something negative will have to deal with the consequences.
Jeremiah,31,31,"Yo fam, listen up! The Lord says that there's gonna be a time when He's gonna hook the house of Israel and the house of Judah up with a fresh new deal, y'know what I'm saying?"
Jeremiah,31,32,"Not how I promised their ancestors back when I rescued them from Egypt; they went and broke that promise, even though I treated them like a loving spouse, says the LORD. Should I have kept being a loving spouse to them?"
Jeremiah,31,33,"But here's the deal, fam. This is gonna be the covenant I'm making with the homies from the house of Israel: After a hot minute, says the LORD, I'm gonna drop my law right into their souls, and it's gonna be engraved in their hearts, ya feel me? I'll be their God, and they'll be my crew."
Jeremiah,31,34,"And they won't have to keep reminding each other, like 'Yo, know God!' 'Cause everyone will know me, from the smallest to the biggest, God says. I'm gonna forgive their wrongs and forget 'em for good."
Jeremiah,31,35,"Yo, listen up! The Big Boss upstairs, in charge of everything, he's the one who made the sun shine during the day, and set up the moon and stars to light up the night. Oh, and get this, he even splits the sea when the waves start getting rowdy. Talk about power! They call him the LORD of hosts, that's his name, ya know?"
Jeremiah,31,36,"If those rules disappear, says the LORD, then Israel will also cease to exist as a nation in my sight, forever."
Jeremiah,31,37,"Listen up, fam! God's saying, 'Yo, if anyone can measure all the way up to heaven or explore what's below the earth's surface, then I'd totally disown the whole nation of Israel for everything they've done,' declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,38,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says that there will come a time when the city will be rebuilt for the LORD, extending from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner."
Jeremiah,31,39,"And they'll keep surveying the area, going up the hill Gareb, and encircling all the way to Goath."
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the entire place where dead bodies and ashes are found, and all the surrounding fields up to the Kidron Stream, and to the corner where the horse gate faces east, will be considered sacred by the LORD. It will never be destroyed or ruined again, ever."
Jeremiah,32,1,"So, this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah's reign as king of Judah, which was also the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"So like, the army of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and Jeremiah, the prophet, was, like, trapped in this prison courtyard, you know? And the courtyard was, like, part of the king of Judah's house."
Jeremiah,32,3,"This was when King Zedekiah of Judah had locked him up and asked him, 'Why are you prophesying and saying that the LORD says, 'I will hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will conquer it?'"
Jeremiah,32,4,"So basically, Zedekiah, the king of Judah, isn't gonna get away from the Chaldeans. He's totally gonna be handed over to the king of Babylon. And get this, they're gonna have a face-to-face convo, like, real personal, where they look right into each other's eyes. It's gonna go down, no doubt."
Jeremiah,32,5,"And Zedekiah will be taken to Babylon, where he will stay until I go see him, says the LORD. Even if you fight against the Chaldeans, you won't succeed."
Jeremiah,32,6,"So, Jeremiah was like, 'Yo, I got a message from the Big Man upstairs, God himself."
Jeremiah,32,7,"Yo, listen up! Your uncle, Hanameel, is gonna swing by and be like, 'Hey, dude, wanna cop my field in Anathoth? You got first dibs to buy it.'"
Jeremiah,32,8,"Yo, this dude Hanameel, who happens to be my uncle's son, hit me up while I was chilling in the prison yard, straight up following what the LORD had told him. He's like, 'Yo, my guy, you gotta buy my field in Anathoth, which is in Benjamin land. It's all yours, bro. You have the right to inherit it and redeem it. Cop it for yourself.' At that moment, I was like, 'Whoa, this is definitely a message from the LORD.'"
Jeremiah,32,9,"So, like, I totally bought this sick field from my uncle's son, Hanameel. It was in Anathoth, you know? And I paid him for it, like, seventeen shekels of silver, man! Or, like, seven shekels and ten pieces of silver, but who's counting, right?"
Jeremiah,32,10,"So, like, I wrote down everything in this document, sealed it up, got some witnesses involved, and even weighed the money on a scale. It's all official and stuff, you know?"
Jeremiah,32,11,"So, like, I got the receipt, ya know, the one sealed and all legit, and the one that was just out in the open:"
Jeremiah,32,12,"So I showed Baruch, who's Neriah's son and Maaseiah's grandson, the proof of the purchase. Hanameel, my uncle's son, was there too, along with the witnesses who signed the contract. They were all watching in the court of the prison, where a bunch of Jews were sitting."
Jeremiah,32,13,"And, like, I told Baruch in front of everyone, I was like,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD of all the groups, the totally awesome God of Israel, wants you to do: Grab those receipts, yup, the ones that are sealed and the ones that are open, and stash 'em in a fancy clay pot. Let 'em chill there for a hot minute, for like, a really long time."
Jeremiah,32,15,"So, like, the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying that people will totally reclaim houses, fields, and vineyards in this land."
Jeremiah,32,16,"So, like, after I gave Baruch, Neriah's son, the receipt for the stuff I bought, I hit up the big man upstairs, you know? And I was like, 'Yo, LORD, listen up..."
Jeremiah,32,17,"OMG, Lord GOD! Like, you totally created the universe and the earth with your great power and awesome strength. And, like, there's legit nothing that's too difficult for you, nothing that you can't handle. Nothing is, like, hidden from you or anything!"
Jeremiah,32,18,"You have so much love, like, for thousands of people, and you like, totally make up for the bad stuff their parents did, by like, passing it on to their kids and all. The Great and Mighty God, the LORD of all the squads, that's, like, His name and all."
Jeremiah,32,19,"You're like the ultimate life coach, always giving the best advice and capable of doing awesome things. You've got your eyes on everyone, seeing everything they do. You make sure that everyone gets what they deserve, based on how they live and the results of their actions."
Jeremiah,32,20,"Bruh, you've been pulling off mad signs and wonders in Egypt, even till now, and also in Israel and among other people. Like, you've totally made a name for yourself, like, even today, you know?"
Jeremiah,32,21,"And you totally rescued your squad, Israel, from Egypt with like, epic signs, mind-blowing wonders, flexed-out strong arms, and mad scary vibes."
Jeremiah,32,22,"And you hooked them up with this lit land you promised their ancestors, a land full of good vibes and dope abundance;"
Jeremiah,32,23,"So they went in and took control of it, but they didn't listen to you or follow your rules. They didn't do any of the things you told them to do, and because of that, all this messed up stuff happened to them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"Yo, check it out! The Chaldeans are rollin' into the city to take it over. It's about to go down with swords, hunger, and diseases. And yeah, what you predicted is actually happening right now. Open your eyes and see it for yourself, fam!"
Jeremiah,32,25,"Yo, God, you told me to go ahead and buy that field with cash and get some witnesses because the city is about to be taken over by the Chaldeans. (or, even though the city is..."
Jeremiah,32,26,"So, God hit up Jeremiah and was like,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"Yo, check it out, I'm the LORD, the God of everyone and everything. Like, is there anything that I can't handle? Doubt it!"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Yo, listen up! God's saying that He's gonna hand over this whole city to the Chaldeans and Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon. And you know what? Nebuchadrezzar is gonna straight up take it over without a doubt."
Jeremiah,32,29,"And those Chaldeans, who are totally against this city, are gonna roll in and straight up light this place on fire, burning down the houses that dared to offer incense to Baal on their roofs and pouring out drink offerings to other gods, all just to really tick me off."
Jeremiah,32,30,"The kids from Israel and Judah haven't exactly been saints since they were young. They've been pushing my buttons, making me mad with all their messed up actions and choices, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,31,"This city has seriously ticked me off since they first built it, and my anger and fury towards it has been building up ever since. It's been one big irritation in my face, and I'm seriously considering getting rid of it once and for all."
Jeremiah,32,32,"Yo, this is why I'm so mad at the Israelites and the people of Judah. They've been doing some messed up stuff that really ticks me off, and it's not just them, it's their leaders, priests, prophets, and everyone in Jerusalem too."
Jeremiah,32,33,"And they've straight up ignored me, like seriously, showing me their back instead of their face. Even though I've been trying to teach them and putting in effort since the crack of dawn, they still haven't bothered to listen and learn. Like, come on, pay attention and open up your ears!"
Jeremiah,32,34,"But like, they totally put all their disgusting stuff in the house that's, like, supposed to be dedicated to me, and it's just, like, so gross, you know? They're totally disrespecting it!"
Jeremiah,32,35,"And they, like, totally set up these trendy places dedicated to Baal in this chill valley, you know? They even went as far as sacrificing their own kids to Molech! Like, seriously? I never even thought about asking them to do something so messed up, man. It's like mega disgusting and leading Judah down the wrong path."
Jeremiah,32,36,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, has to say about this city y'all been talkin' bout. You think it's gonna fall into the hands of the king of Babylon through war, hunger, and disease?"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna gather all those peeps from every corner of the world. Yup, the ones I got mad at and sent packing, fueled by my anger and rage. But hey, don't sweat it, because I'm gonna bring them back to this very spot and make sure they live in peace and safety, no worries!"
Jeremiah,32,38,"They're gonna be my squad, and I'm gonna be their ultimate BFF:"
Jeremiah,32,39,"And I'll make them all united, following the same path, so they'll always respect me with awe, for their own benefit and for the benefit of their future fam, like, forever and ever, you know what I'm saying? #allthedayseveryday"
Jeremiah,32,40,"And I'm gonna make this super tight forever bond with them, where I won't ever dip on them and I'll keep blessing them. But I'll also make sure they have mad respect and reverence for me, so they won't ever straight up ghost me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"Totally stoked, I'm gonna bring the good vibes and hook them up with a sick spot in this land, no doubt, straight from my heart and soul. {assuredly: Hebrew meaning truth or stability}"
Jeremiah,32,42,"Yo, listen up! The LORD is saying, just like I brought all this crazy bad stuff to these people, I'm gonna bring them all the awesome goodness that I've promised!"
Jeremiah,32,43,"And people are gonna start snagging up some prime real estate in this land that y'all thought was totally abandoned, with no humans or animals in sight! But guess what, it's actually gonna be handed over to the Chaldeans, so get ready for some new landlords!"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Dudes will be getting fields by paying cash, signing documents, putting a seal on them, and getting witnesses in Benjamin, around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the mountains, the valley, and the south. It's because I, the LORD, will bring their captivity back, no doubt about it."
Jeremiah,33,1,"So, God reached out to Jeremiah once again while he was locked up in the prison courtyard, and this is what God said,"
Jeremiah,33,2,"Yo, listen up! The LORD, the one who made everything, yeah, that's right, the LORD who formed it all, is here to keep it all in line. His name? It's the LORD, no doubt. Trust that, fam."
Jeremiah,33,3,"Hit me up, and I'll be there with some epic surprises that will blow your mind. It's gonna be stuff you've never even imagined. {hidden: or, super secret}"
Jeremiah,33,4,"Yo, listen up, ya'll! The LORD, the God of Israel, has a message about the cribz in this city and the cribs of the kings of Judah. They got wrecked by the battering rams and swords, yo!"
Jeremiah,33,5,"They're basically going up against the Chaldeans thinking they're all tough, but guess what? They're gonna end up filled with dead bodies. Those people were total casualties because I was super mad and furious. I totally turned away and hid my face from this city because of all the wickedness going on."
Jeremiah,33,6,"Yo, check it out, I've got some sick remedies coming their way. I'm gonna heal 'em up, reveal a ton of peace and truth. It's gonna be lit."
Jeremiah,33,7,"And I'll bring back the people of Judah and Israel from their exile and rebuild them, just like before."
Jeremiah,33,8,"I'll totally wipe out all the bad stuff they did that was against me, like seriously, every single thing. And I'll forgive every single one of their wrongdoings, like seriously, all of them, and all the times they messed up and went against me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"And it's gonna be like, a super cool, awesome name that brings joy and mad respect from every nation on earth. They're gonna hear about all the awesome things I do for them and they'll be amazed and totally shook by all the goodness and prosperity I'm bringing their way."
Jeremiah,33,10,"God said this: Once again, there will be sounds in this spot that you thought would be empty and abandoned -- in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Even though they were once empty without people and animals, they will come alive again!"
Jeremiah,33,11,"Yo, listen up! There's gonna be so much hype and celebration - it's gonna be lit! We'll hear the joyful noise of the bride and groom, and everyone will be like, Praisee the Lord of hosts, yo!' Because, you know, the Lord is good and his mercy is forever. And those who bring their praise game to the house of the Lord will be amazing. And guess what? The Lord is gonna bring back good times to the land, just like before, God says."
Jeremiah,33,12,"Yo, listen up, says the big man upstairs! This place, totally abandoned with no humans or animals, and all the cities around it, are gonna be buzzing with shepherds and their flocks chilling out."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities up in the mountains, the cities down in the valley, and the cities in the south, as well as in the land of Benjamin, and all around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will be counted once again by the shepherd, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,14,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says that the time is coming when I'm gonna do that awesome thing I promised to the peeps of Israel and Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,"During those times, when everything goes down, I'm gonna make this righteous hero rise up for David. He's gonna bring justice and righteousness to the whole land, no doubt."
Jeremiah,33,16,"During that time, Judah will be rescued and Jerusalem will live securely. They will be known as The LORD our righteousness."
Jeremiah,33,17,"So, listen up! This is what the LORD says: David will always have someone to rule over the house of Israel. No one from David's bloodline will ever be cut off from being king."
Jeremiah,33,18,"The priests, the Levites, gotta be on point to offer those sick burnt offerings, light up those meat offerings, and keep the sacrifice game strong, no breaks allowed."
Jeremiah,33,19,"So, like, God had a message for Jeremiah, and it was all like,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"Listen up, fam! God's like, 'Yo, if any of y'all think you can totally cancel my day-night agreement, think again! Like, if you can somehow stop the rotation of the Earth and make day and night disappear, I'll be impressed! But good luck with that!'"
Jeremiah,33,21,"And, like, I wouldn't even think of breaking my covenant with David, dude. I mean, no way he won't have a son to rule on his throne, you know? And the Levite priests, man, they're totally my ministers. No breaking that bond either."
Jeremiah,33,22,"Yo, it's like counting the stars in the sky or measuring the sand at the beach, imma multiply the descendants of my homie David and the Levites who do their thing for me."
Jeremiah,33,23,"So God hit up Jeremiah and was like,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"Yo, haven't you heard what these people are saying? They're dissing the two families that God chose and saying He's rejected them! Not cool. This is basically them hating on my peeps, acting like they shouldn't even be considered a nation anymore."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Listen up, fam! The LORD says, 'If I'm not down with day and night, and I haven't set up the rules for the sky and earth, then I don't know what's popping!'"
Jeremiah,33,26,"And then, like, I'm gonna totally reject the descendants of Jacob and my homie David, you know? I won't let any of their descendants be rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob anymore. But don't worry, I'll make their captivity end and show them some mad mercy."
Jeremiah,34,1,"So, there's this message that God sent to Jeremiah, right? It was when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and his whole army, along with all the other kingdoms under his rule, were attacking Jerusalem and all its cities. God was like, 'Yo, listen up everyone!'"
Jeremiah,34,2,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying: Go and have a chat with Zedekiah, the king of Judah. Tell him this from the LORD: Yo, check it out, I'm handing over this city to the king of Babylon, and he's gonna set it on fire, no cap!"
Jeremiah,34,3,"You won't be able to get away from him. He's gonna catch you and hand you over to the king of Babylon. You'll come face to face with him, and he'll have a direct convo with you. Then, you'll be sent off to Babylon."
Jeremiah,34,4,"But check it, Zedekiah, the king of Judah, listen up! This is what the Lord wants you to know: you won't meet your demise through the sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You're gonna die peacefully, and they gonna honor you with the traditional burnings of your ancestors, just like they did for the kings that came before you. They gonna offer sweet-smelling stuff for you and everyone gonna be crying, like 'Oh lord! I spoke the truth, says the LORD.'"
Jeremiah,34,6,"So, Jeremiah, the prophet, like, spoke all these words to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,34,7,"So, when Babylon's squad rolled up to Jerusalem and all the leftover cities in Judah like Lachish and Azekah, they were basically taking on the last standing fortresses from Judah."
Jeremiah,34,8,"Yo, here's the message that God dropped on Jeremiah after King Zedekiah made a pact with all the folks in Jerusalem, promising to give 'em freedom."
Jeremiah,34,9,"Yo, everyone should set free their homies, whether they're dudes or girls, and whether they're a Hebrew guy or a Hebrew girl. Like, no one should be using them as slaves or anything, especially not a Jewish person towards their fellow Jew."
Jeremiah,34,10,"So, like, when all the big shots and everyone who had agreed to the deal heard that they should set their male and female servants free and not exploit them anymore, they were like, 'Cool, we're down with that!' and they let them go."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But then they changed their minds and brought back the employees they had set free, making them servants and maids once again."
Jeremiah,34,12,"So, like, God hit up Jeremiah with a message, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"Listen up, fam! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, wants you to know: I totally made a deal (like a legit covenant) with your ancestors back in the day when I freed them from Egypt, where they were stuck as slaves. Here's what I said to 'em:"
Jeremiah,34,14,"After seven years, you must release any Hebrew brother who has been sold to you. If they have served you for six years, you must set them free. However, your ancestors didn't listen to me or pay attention to my words."
Jeremiah,34,15,"And you guys were totally on point and pleasing to me when you stood up for freedom, making sure that everyone was treated equally. You even made a legit agreement with me in my crib, the place I'm all about. Let's keep it real, this was recent, like today's news!"
Jeremiah,34,16,"But y'all messed up and disrespected my name, and made every person bring back the servants and maidservants whom y'all had set free. You made them slaves again, serving you."
Jeremiah,34,17,"So listen up, this is what the LORD says: Y'all didn't listen to me when I said to give freedom and equality to each other. Well, guess what? I'm declaring freedom for you, but not the kind you want. It's gonna come in the form of war, sickness, and hunger. You're gonna be scattered all over the world, in different kingdoms. Deal with it."
Jeremiah,34,18,"I'm gonna give those guys that broke my covenant, you know, the ones who didn't keep their promises when they sliced that calf in half and walked through it—I'm gonna give them what they deserve."
Jeremiah,34,19,"The cool dudes of Judah and Jerusalem, the squad, and the religious peeps, and all the people of the land, who were hanging out together like party animals;"
Jeremiah,34,20,I'm gonna let their enemies and those after them take them down. Their dead bodies will become a feast for birds in the sky and creatures on the ground.
Jeremiah,34,21,"So, like, Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his squad, I'm about to let them be taken over by their enemies, the people who wanna end their lives, and the king of Babylon's army, who's like rolling in from all directions."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Listen up, the LORD is about to drop a command: I'm gonna make these people bounce back to the city, and they'll straight up battle against it, snatch it, and light it up with fire. And to top it off, I'm gonna turn the cities of Judah into a total ghost town, empty and destroyed."
Jeremiah,35,1,"Yo, listen up fam! This message went straight to Jeremiah from the LORD back in the days of Jehoiakim, Josiah's son and the king of Judah. Check it out!"
Jeremiah,35,2,"Head over to the crib of the Rechabites and hit them up. Bring them to the house of the LORD, into one of the chill rooms, and hook them up with some lit wine to sip on."
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I got Jaazaniah, who is the son of Jeremiah and Habaziniah, along with his siblings and all his children, and the entire Rechabite family."
Jeremiah,35,4,"So I took them to the house of the LORD, to the room where the cool kids hang out - the swaggy sons of Hanan, who's like a super spiritual dude. Their room was next to the room where the fancy dudes chill, and above the room of Maaseiah, who's in charge of the entrance. (Note: the word 'door' can also mean 'threshold' or 'vessel' in this context.)"
Jeremiah,35,5,"So, I placed some totally lit wine-filled containers and cups in front of the cool kids from the Rechabite fam, and I was like, 'Yo, go ahead and sip on that wine!'"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But like, they were all like, 'Nah, we're not gonna drink any wine, 'cause our dad Jonadab was like, 'Yo, never drink wine, not you or your future kids, fam'."
Jeremiah,35,7,"Don't even think about building houses or planting crops or growing vineyards, because that's a big no-no. Instead, you gotta live in tents for your whole life, like legit nomads. That's the only way you'll rack up many days in this foreign land, yo!"
Jeremiah,35,8,"So, like, we've totally followed everything that Jonadab, our dad, told us to do. He was all like, 'Don't drink any wine ever,' and we've been like, 'Sure, no problem!' And get this, it's not just us, but also our spouses, kids, and even our daughters! We're all in this together, following Jonadab's orders."
Jeremiah,35,9,"And we don't even have any cool houses to live in, or like, any vineyards, fields, or seeds or anything."
Jeremiah,35,10,"But yo, we've been kickin' it in tents, straight up following and doing everything that Jonadab, our father, told us to do."
Jeremiah,35,11,"So, like, when Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, invaded our turf, we were, like, 'Yo, let's bounce to Jerusalem 'cause we're scared AF of the Chaldeans and the Syrians, man.' So yeah, now we just chill in Jerusalem, no cap."
Jeremiah,35,12,"And then God spoke to Jeremiah, like,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"Yo, listen up fam! God, the OG of Israel, got a message for y'all. Go spread the word to the peeps in Judah and Jerusalem. Ain't y'all gonna listen and take some lessons from me? That's what God's sayin', yo!"
Jeremiah,35,14,"Listen up fam, Jonadab, son of Rechab, gave his sons a strict rule: no sippin' on that wine. And guess what? Till this day, they stay loyal to daddy's command. But yo, I've been preaching to y'all, waking up early to get this message across, but ya'll ain't tryna listen to me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"Yo, I've totally sent all my prophets to you guys, waking up early and sending them and stuff. I was like, 'Yo, everyone needs to turn away from their wicked ways and start doing what's right. Don't go chasing after other gods and worshipping them. If you listen to me, you'll totally get to live in the land that I promised you and your ancestors.' But y'all didn't even bother to pay attention or listen to what I had to say."
Jeremiah,35,16,"Yo, the homies of Jonadab, Rechab's son, they've been totally following their dad's orders like a boss. But this bunch right here? Nah, they ain't been listening to me, fam."
Jeremiah,35,17,"So this is what the LORD God of all powerful armies, the God of Israel, is saying: Hey, listen up! I'm gonna make sure all the bad stuff I warned Judah and the people of Jerusalem about actually happens. Why? Because I tried talking to them, but they didn't bother listening, and I reached out, but they didn't bother answering."
Jeremiah,35,18,"Yo, Jeremiah was like, 'Listen up, Rechabites fam! This is what the Almighty God of Israel has to say: You guys have straight up nailed it by following your father Jonadab's commandments and staying true to all his teachings."
Jeremiah,35,19,"So, like, this is what the LORD of all the cool guys, the God of Israel, has to say: Jonadab, son of Rechab, will always have someone to represent him in front of me. No one will ever be cut off from Jonadab and his descendants, you know? Like, they'll always be standing and stuff, doing their thing."
Jeremiah,36,1,"And like, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, Josiah's son, who was, like, the king of Judah, this word, you know, came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"Yo, grab a notebook and write down all the stuff I've been telling you about Israel, Judah, and all the other nations. I've been talkin' since the days of Josiah until now, so don't miss a word!"
Jeremiah,36,3,"Yo, maybe the peeps from the tribe of Judah will actually listen to all the bad stuff I'm planning to do to them, so they can turn away from their wicked ways. Then I can hook them up with some forgiveness for all their wrongdoings and sins."
Jeremiah,36,4,"So Jeremiah hit up Baruch, Neriah's son, and Baruch straight up wrote down everything the LORD said to Jeremiah. He wrote it all down on a scroll, like a boss."
Jeremiah,36,5,"So Jeremiah told Baruch, like, 'Dude, I'm totally stuck and can't even go to the Lord's crib, you know?"
Jeremiah,36,6,So go ahead and check out the script you've transcribed from my message. Make sure you share the words of the LORD with the people at the LORD'S house during the fasting day. And don't forget to read them to all the folks from Judah who are coming from their cities too.
Jeremiah,36,7,"Maybe they'll humble themselves before the LORD and turn away from their wicked ways, because the LORD's anger and fury against these people is serious. But even if they do that, their prayers might not change anything."
Jeremiah,36,8,"So, Baruch, Neriah's kid, totally did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do. He was like, reading out loud from this book, sharing all the words of the LORD up in His crib."
Jeremiah,36,9,"So, like, in the fifth year when Jehoiakim, who is Josiah's son and the king of Judah, was ruling, in the ninth month, they announced a mega fast to everyone in Jerusalem and all the peeps who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,36,10,"So Baruch read out Jeremiah's words from the book at the house of the LORD. He was in a room belonging to Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, who was a scribe. They were in the upper part of the courtyard, near the entrance of the shiny new gate of the LORD'S house. And everyone was listening carefully."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Michaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the book,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"So he went to the king's crib, where all the important peeps were chilling. And guess who was there? Elishama, the scribe dude, along with Delaiah, Shemaiah's son, Elnathan, Achbor's son, Gemariah, Shaphan's son, Zedekiah, Hananiah's son, and all the other cool peeps."
Jeremiah,36,13,So Michaiah spilled all the tea about everything he heard when Baruch dropped all the truth bombs while reading the book out loud to everyone.
Jeremiah,36,14,"So, like, all the important dudes sent this guy named Jehudi (super random name, right?) to fetch this other guy Baruch. They were like, 'Hey, bring that scroll you were reading to everyone and come over here.' And Baruch, being a total legend, took the scroll and went to meet them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they were like, 'Yo, take a seat and read it out loud for us.' So Baruch read that stuff out loud for them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"So, like, after they heard everything, they were totally shook, and they were like, 'Yo, Baruch, we gotta spill the tea to the king about all this stuff!'"
Jeremiah,36,17,"So they're like, 'Hey Baruch, spill the tea. How'd you even write down all these words straight from his mouth?'"
Jeremiah,36,18,"So Baruch was like, yo, he straight up said all this stuff to me and I wrote it down in the book using some ink."
Jeremiah,36,19,"So the high-ranking peeps were like, 'Yo, Baruch, disappear with Jeremiah. Keep it on the down-low and stay lowkey, you feel?"
Jeremiah,36,20,"So they went to the king in his crib, but they stashed the scroll in Elishama the scribe's crib, and spilled all the tea in the king's ears."
Jeremiah,36,21,So the king told Jehudi to grab the scroll: and he snatched it from Elishama the scribe's room. And Jehudi read it aloud to the king and all the cool princes standing by the king.
Jeremiah,36,22,"So, like, the king was chilling in his cozy winterhouse in, like, November or something, and there was, you know, a totally cozy fire burning right in front of him on the hearth."
Jeremiah,36,23,"So, like, Jehudi was reading this book, right? And after he read, like, three or four pages, he just took out his pocket knife and cut it up. Then he threw the pieces into the fire that was burning on the fireplace. He kept doing that until the whole book was completely burned up."
Jeremiah,36,24,"But they weren't even shook, and didn't even rip their clothes, not even the king or any of his peeps when they heard what was said."
Jeremiah,36,25,"However, Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah tried to convince the king not to destroy the scroll, but he straight up ignored them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"The king told Jerahmeel, Hammelech's kid, Seraiah, Azriel's kid, and Shelemiah, Abdeel's kid, to grab Baruch, the writer, and Jeremiah, the prophet. But God hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"So, God spoke to Jeremiah after the king straight up burned the scroll and the words that Baruch wrote while Jeremiah dictated them, like, wow,"
Jeremiah,36,28,Get another scroll and rewrite all the stuff from the first scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah straight up torched.
Jeremiah,36,29,"Yo, Jehoiakim, listen up, it's the LORD speaking! You straight up torched that scroll, asking why it said that Babylon's king would totally come and wreck this land, wiping out both humans and animals. Smh."
Jeremiah,36,30,"So, like, this is what God says about Jehoiakim, the king of Judah: No one is gonna take his place as the ruler from David's family. And when he dies, they're just gonna throw his body out during hot days and freezing nights. It's gonna be rough, man."
Jeremiah,36,31,"So, like, I'm totally gonna give this guy and his whole crew a real dose of consequences for all the bad stuff they've done. And guess what? I'm gonna make sure they, the peeps in Jerusalem, and all the peeps in Judah have to face all the bad stuff I said would happen. But, TBH, they didn't even listen."
Jeremiah,36,32,"So Jeremiah grabbed another scroll and gave it to Baruch, the scribe, who was Neriah's son. Baruch wrote down everything that Jeremiah had said, word for word, in the book that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire. Not only that, but Baruch also added many more words similar to the ones before. (FYI: 'like' in Hebrew can mean 'as they')"
Jeremiah,37,1,"Yo, Zedekiah, Josiah's offspring, took over as king after Coniah, Jehoiakim's son, whom Nebuchadrezzar, the Babylonian king, put in charge of Judah."
Jeremiah,37,2,"But none of them, not the king, his servants, or the people, listened to what God said through the prophet Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,37,3,"So, like, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal, Shelemiah's kid, and Zephaniah, who's Maaseiah's offspring, to Prophet Jeremiah, asking him to, like, pray to the LORD our God for us."
Jeremiah,37,4,"So, like, Jeremiah was just hanging out with the people, you know? They didn't lock him up or anything."
Jeremiah,37,5,"So like, Pharaoh's army rolled out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were surrounding Jerusalem got wind of it, they bounced from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Yo, the Lord dropped a message to Jeremiah the prophet, like,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, gotta say: Go tell the king of Judah who sent you to ask me a question. Check it out, Pharaoh's army you were counting on for help? Well, they're gonna head back to Egypt, to their own turf."
Jeremiah,37,8,"Yo, the Chaldeans are gonna make a comeback and straight up battle against this city, then snatch it and set it ablaze."
Jeremiah,37,9,"Listen up, fam! This is what the LORD says: Don't fool yourselves and think that the Chaldeans are gonna bounce from our turf. Nah, they ain't going anywhere. Don't play yourselves, ya feel me? The deal's legit. No cap."
Jeremiah,37,10,"Even if y'all totally wrecked the entire Chaldean army that's tryna attack you, and only a few wounded soldiers were left, those dudes would still rise up in their tents and set this city on fire. Ya know, even though they're injured!"
Jeremiah,37,11,"So, like, after the Chaldeans' army bounced from Jerusalem because they were scared of Pharaoh's army, you know? It's like they left in a hurry, man!"
Jeremiah,37,12,"So, Jeremiah left Jerusalem and headed to the land of Benjamin, just wanting some space away from all the people. He needed to slip away without anyone noticing."
Jeremiah,37,13,"So, like, when he was chilling at the gate of Benjamin, there was this dude called Irijah who was like the captain of the guard or something. He grabbed Jeremiah the prophet and was all like, 'Bro, you're totally betraying us by joining forces with the Chaldeans.'"
Jeremiah,37,14,"Jeremiah was like, 'Nah, that's not true, I ain't switching sides to the Chaldeans.' But they didn't listen to him and Irijah grabbed Jeremiah and handed him over to the rulers."
Jeremiah,37,15,"So, like, the princes got super mad at Jeremiah, and totally attacked him, and threw him in jail at Jonathan the scribe's crib, 'cause that's where they kept all the prisoners and stuff."
Jeremiah,37,16,"So, like, when Jeremiah was thrown into this super dark and creepy dungeon with all these small cells, he had to stay there for, like, a really long time, you know?"
Jeremiah,37,17,"So King Zedekiah was like, 'Yo, get Jeremiah out of there.' And then the king was all sneaky and asked Jeremiah in private, 'Dude, did God say anything?' And Jeremiah was like, 'Yeah, bro. He totally said that you're gonna be handed over to the Babylonian king.'"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Yo, Jeremiah straight up asked King Zedekiah, like, what did I even do to you, your crew, or the peeps, for you to lock me up in this slammer?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"So, like, where are all those prophets who were like, 'Yo, don't worry fam, the king of Babylon ain't gonna come and mess with you or this land'?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Yo, listen up, my dude the king: I'm begging you, please, accept my request; don't send me back to Jonathan the scribe's crib, 'cause I don't wanna die there. Drop my request, fam."
Jeremiah,37,21,"So King Zedekiah was like, 'Yo, put Jeremiah in prison and make sure he gets a daily bread from the bakers' street until all the bread in the city is gone.' And that's how Jeremiah ended up stuck in the prison court."
Jeremiah,38,1,"So Shephatiah, Mattan's son, Gedaliah, Pashur's son, Jucal, Shelemiah's son, and Malchiah's son Pashur, heard what Jeremiah said to everyone,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"Yo, listen up! The LORD got a message: Anyone chillin' in this city gonna face death from the sword, famine, and disease. But if you bounce to the Chaldeans, you'll survive, man! You'll be able to keep your life and live on, no cap."
Jeremiah,38,3,"Yo, God's like, 'Listen up, y'all! This city's definitely gonna be taken over by King Babylon's army, no doubt."
Jeremiah,38,4,"So the rulers went to the king and said, Please have this person executed, because he's talking in a way that makes the soldiers and the people lose confidence. He's not seeking the good of the people, but trying to harm them."
Jeremiah,38,5,"So King Zedekiah was like, yo, he's totally in your control, 'cause the king ain't got no power to go against you or anything."
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they grabbed Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon owned by Malchiah, the son of Hammelech. This dungeon was located in the courtyard of the prison. They lowered Jeremiah down with ropes. The dungeon didn't have any water, just a muddy mess. Jeremiah ended up sinking into the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"So, like, there was this guy named Ebedmelech, who was an Ethiopian and one of the eunuchs hanging out in the king's crib, right? And he got word that they threw Jeremiah into the dungeon. And guess what? The king was just chilling at the gate of Benjamin."
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebedmelech bounced out of the king's crib, and hit up the king, like yo,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"Yo, king dude, these guys have been super shady with everything they've done to Jeremiah the prophet. They straight up threw him in a dungeon, and now he's starving in there 'cause there's no more food left in the city. It's so messed up, he's about to die!"
Jeremiah,38,10,"So the king told Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, 'Yo, grab thirty homies and rescue Jeremiah the prophet from that prison before he kicks the bucket. And make sure to bring him out safe, you feel me?' {with thee: like, hang with you or something}"
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebedmelech was like, 'Yo, come on dudes,' and they all rolled up to the king's crib, where he kept his stash. They grabbed some super old, gross clothes and lowered them down into the dungeon where Jeremiah was chillin'."
Jeremiah,38,12,"Yo, Ebedmelech the Ethiopian was like, 'Yo Jeremiah, take these crusty old clothes and put them under your armholes, under the ropes.' And Jeremiah was like, 'Bet, I gotchu,' and did as he was told."
Jeremiah,38,13,"Like, they like pulled Jeremiah up with some cords, and like got him out of that depressing dungeon place. And yeah, Jeremiah just like stayed in the court of the prison after that, you know?"
Jeremiah,38,14,"So King Zedekiah hit up Jeremiah the prophet and brought him into the third entrance of the Lord's house. And the king was like, yo Jeremiah, I got a question for you. Don't hold back, spill all the tea."
Jeremiah,38,15,"So, like, Jeremiah was all like, 'Dude, if I tell you what's up, aren't you gonna straight up murder me? And if I give you some advice, won't you actually, like, listen to me?'"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah, the king, totally swore under the radar to Jeremiah, like, 'I swear on everything holy, like, the Almighty God who brought our souls into existence, I won't wipe you out and I won't let those dudes out there who wanna take your life get their hands on you.'"
Jeremiah,38,17,"So, like, Jeremiah told Zedekiah, and I'm quoting the LORD, the Almighty God of Israel saying: 'If you really go and meet up with the important guys from Babylon's king, then you'll be safe, man. And this city won't get all burned up, and you and your family will stay alive.'"
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you don't listen to the princes of the king of Babylon and refuse to leave, then this city will be taken over by the Chaldeans, and they will set it on fire. You won't be able to escape from them."
Jeremiah,38,19,"So, King Zedekiah was like, 'Jeremiah, dude, I'm totally scared of the Jews who joined the Chaldeans! I mean, what if they hand me over to them and start roasting me? That's my worst nightmare! 🙈"
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah was like, 'Nah, they ain't gonna save you, bro. Just listen up and do what the LORD told you through me. Trust me, it'll go well for you and keep your soul alive.'"
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you're, like, totally not into going outside, this is, like, what the LORD has told me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"Yo, listen up! All the ladies left in the king of Judah's crib are gonna be brought to the big shots of Babylon, and these girls gonna be like, 'Your homies played you, man! They came out on top. You're stuck in a messy situation, and they straight up left you hangin'."
Jeremiah,38,23,"So, like, all your wives and kids will be taken by the Chaldeans, and there's no way you can escape from them. The king of Babylon is gonna capture you, and you're gonna be responsible for setting this city on fire. Yep, you're gonna burn it down. Literal fire emoji. 🔥"
Jeremiah,38,24,"So Zedekiah was like, 'Ay, Jeremiah, keep this on the down-low! If anyone finds out, you won't get killed, bro.'"
Jeremiah,38,25,"But, like, if the high-ranking peeps find out that I like totally chatted with you, and they come up to you saying, 'Dude, spill the beans on what you said to the king. Don't keep it a secret from us, and we won't like kill you or anything,' spill about what the king told you too, ya know?"
Jeremiah,38,26,"So like, I went up to the king and was all like, 'Bro, I'm begging you, don't make me go back to Jonathan's house and like, die there.'"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the high-ranking peeps rolled up to Jeremiah, and they were like, yo, spill the tea: what did the king say? And he straight up told them everything the king commanded. After that, they stopped talking to him 'cause they were clueless about what went down. {they...: They were totally speechless}"
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah stayed in the prison courtyard until the day Jerusalem got captured: and he was still there when Jerusalem got captured.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign as king over Judah, during the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, rolled up on Jerusalem with his whole army and set up camp around the city."
Jeremiah,39,2,"And, like, in the 11th year of Zedekiah, on the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was totally wrecked."
Jeremiah,39,3,"So like, all the cool high-ranking dudes of the king of Babylon showed up and sat at the main entrance. There were names like Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer (again? Double cool points), Rabmag, and all the other important peeps from the king's crew."
Jeremiah,39,4,"So, like, when Zedekiah, the king of Judah, noticed them and all the dudes in the army, they totally panicked and hightailed it out of the city during the night. They sneaked out through the king's garden, using the gate between the two walls. And he made his escape along the plain."
Jeremiah,39,5,"So, like, the Chaldean army was totally chasing after them, and they caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, you know? And when they finally got him, they brought him straight to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, in this place called Riblah in the land of Hamath. And there, Nebuchadnezzar gave him a serious piece of his mind, if you catch my drift. No judgment, just saying."
Jeremiah,39,6,"And, like, the king of Babylon straight up killed Zedekiah's sons right in front of him, you know? Oh, and he also killed all the fancy peeps from Judah. It was gnarly, dude."
Jeremiah,39,7,"And he like, totally blinded Zedekiah and put him in chains to take him to Babylon. He used, like, two super strong chains or whatever. #NoEscape"
Jeremiah,39,8,"And then the Chaldeans totally set fire to the king's crib and the people's cribs, like fireyyyyyy! They straight up wrecked the walls of Jerusalem, no chill whatsoever."
Jeremiah,39,9,"So Nebuzaradan, the boss of the squad, took all the leftover peeps from the city, including those who switched sides and joined him, along with the rest of the crew who were still there, and sent them off to Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan, the big boss of the guards, felt for the poor folks who had nothing in the land of Judah. So he hooked them up with vineyards and fields all at once. And it happened just like that!"
Jeremiah,39,11,"So King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon ordered Nebuzaradan, the leader of his guards, to take care of Jeremiah. He said, 'Make sure you look after Jeremiah and keep him safe.'"
Jeremiah,39,12,"Yo, take this guy, and keep a close eye on him, but don't hurt him. Just do whatever he tells you to do."
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan, the leader of the squad, totally slid through with his crew - Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the top dogs from the Babylonian kingdom. They were like, super important, you know? #squadgoals"
Jeremiah,39,14,"So, like, they went and got Jeremiah out of that prison place and gave him to this guy, Gedaliah, who was like the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan. They wanted Gedaliah to take Jeremiah home, so he could live among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"So, God suddenly hit up Jeremiah with a message while he was chilling in the prison yard, like,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"Yo, go hit up Ebedmelech the Ethiopian and drop this message: the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, got something to say. Peep this, Imma bring some serious bad vibes upon this city, not no good ones, and it's gonna go down when you're there to witness it."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But no worries, I got your back, says the LORD. You won't have to deal with those people you're all scared of."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For real, I got you covered, no one's gonna mess you up. Your life is gonna be rescued 'cause you trusted me, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,40,1,"So, like, Jeremiah got this message from the LORD, after Nebuzaradan, the head dude of the guards, set him free from Ramah. See, Jeremiah was all tied up in chains, you know, among all the people who were taken as prisoners from Jerusalem and Judah and brought to Babylon. Chains, man!"
Jeremiah,40,2,"So the head honcho of the squad grabbed Jeremiah and was like, 'Yo, God straight up called out this place for some bad juju.'"
Jeremiah,40,3,"Yo, the LORD straight up made this happen, just like He said He would, because y'all sinned against Him and didn't listen to His voice. So yeah, this is what you get."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Yo, listen up! Today, I'm setting you free from those chains on your hands. If you wanna roll with me to Babylon, you're welcome to join, and I'll make sure you're taken care of. But if you're not feelin' it and don't wanna go with me to Babylon, that's cool too. You've got the whole land ahead of you, so go wherever you think is best. It's all up to you, my friend."
Jeremiah,40,5,"Before he left, he said, 'Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. The king of Babylon appointed him as the governor of the cities in Judah. Live with him and the people there, or go wherever you feel like going.' So the captain of the guard gave him food and a reward, and allowed him to leave."
Jeremiah,40,6,"So Jeremiah went to hang out with Gedaliah, who was Ahikam's son, in Mizpah. He chilled with the peeps who were still left in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"So, like, when all the big shots leading the armies in the fields, like, them and their crews, heard that the king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, as governor in the land and put him in charge of the peeps, including guys, gals, kids, and even the less fortunate who weren't taken as prisoners to Babylon;"
Jeremiah,40,8,"So, like, Gedaliah was in Mizpah, right? And then Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, along with Johanan, Jonathan, Kareah's sons, and Seraiah, Tanhumeth's son, and Ephai's dudes from Netophathite, and Jezaniah, Maachathite's son, all showed up with their squads."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, promised and assured them, along with their crew, not to stress about working for the Chaldeans. Just chill and stay in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and everything's gonna be alright."
Jeremiah,40,10,"So like, here's the deal - I'm gonna stay at Mizpah and do my thing for the Chaldeans, who are coming our way. But you guys, go gather some wine, summer fruits, and oil, and stash them in your containers. Oh, and settle down in the cities you've taken for yourselves."
Jeremiah,40,11,"So, like, when all the Jewish peeps chillin' in Moab, among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and, like, all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had spared some of Judah, and appointed Gedaliah (the homie, Ahikam's son, who's Shaphan's son too) to lead 'em;"
Jeremiah,40,12,"Like, all the Jews went back from wherever they were scattered to the land of Judah, to this guy Gedaliah in Mizpah, and they scored tons of wine and summer fruits."
Jeremiah,40,13,"And then Johanan (aka JoJo) and all the squad leaders that were out in the fields, rolled up to Gedaliah's place in Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,40,14,"And he's like, yo, did you even realize that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, sent Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, to straight up kill you? But Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, was like, nah, man, I ain't buying that."
Jeremiah,40,15,"So, Johanan, Kareah's son, approached Gedaliah secretly in Mizpah and said, 'Hey, let me handle Ishmael, Nethaniah's son. No one will even suspect a thing. If he takes you out, all of us Jews who trust in you will be scattered, and the remaining survivors in Judah will be wiped out.'"
Jeremiah,40,16,"Yo, Gedaliah, bro of Ahikam, straight up told Johanan, Kareah's offspring, like, 'Nah dude, don't go there. You're spewing mad lies 'bout Ishmael, fam'."
Jeremiah,41,1,"So, like, in the seventh month, Ishmael, who was Nethaniah's son and from a super important fam, and ten other guys who were like the prince's squad, went to chill with Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, in Mizpah. And, yo, they all grabbed a bite to eat together."
Jeremiah,41,2,"So, Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, alongside ten dudes, stood up and straight-up attacked Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, and Shaphan's grandson, with a sword. He straight-up killed him, even though the king of Babylon had made him the big boss of the whole land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael straight up went on a killing spree, taking down all the Jews hanging with Gedaliah and some Chaldeans that were chillin' at Mizpah, including the badass warriors."
Jeremiah,41,4,"And like, the next day after he took down Gedaliah, nobody even knew, you know?"
Jeremiah,41,5,"So like, a bunch of dudes, around 80 of them, came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They were looking all fresh with their shaved beards, torn clothes, and they even cut themselves. And get this, they had offerings and incense in their hands, all ready to bring them to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, came out of Mizpah to meet them. He was crying the whole time as he went. When he met them, he said to them, 'Come to Gedaliah, Ahikam's son.'"
Jeremiah,41,7,"And like, when they got to the city, Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, straight up killed them and tossed them into this pit in the city along with his crew."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But there were ten dudes who stepped up to Ishmael and were like, 'Dude, don't kill us! We've got some sick loot in the field: wheat, barley, oil, and honey.' So Ishmael chilled out and spared their lives, didn't mess with his own peeps."
Jeremiah,41,9,"So, like, Ishmael threw all the dead bodies of the guys he killed because of Gedaliah in this pit. It was the same pit that King Asa made because he was scared of King Baasha of Israel, you know? And then Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, filled it up with all those people he killed."
Jeremiah,41,10,"So Ishmael took away everyone else who was in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who were still in Mizpah. They were under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, who had been put in charge by Nebuzaradan, the leader of the king's guard. Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, took them captive and went to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But then, when Johanan, Kareah's son, and all the squad leaders rollin' deep with him got word of all the messed up stuff that Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, pulled off,"
Jeremiah,41,12,"So they rounded up all the guys and went to battle against Ishmael, Nethaniah's son. They caught him chillin' by the lit lakes in Gibeon, y'know."
Jeremiah,41,13,"So like, when Ishmael's crew peeped Johanan, Kareah's son, and his whole squad roll through, they were hella stoked."
Jeremiah,41,14,"Once Ishmael had taken all the people from Mizpah as captives, they eventually turned around and went to join Johanan, Kareah's son."
Jeremiah,41,15,"Yo, Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, managed to dip out with eight homies from Johanan and bounced to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,16,"So Johanan, Kareah's son, gathered all the leaders and the rest of the people he saved from Ishmael, Nethaniah's son. They were in Mizpah after Gedaliah, Ahikam's son, was killed. This included brave warriors, women, children, and eunuchs that he brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they left and settled in Chimham's crib, near Bethlehem, to head to Egypt,"
Jeremiah,41,18,"This happened because of the Chaldeans, duh! They were totally freaked out because Ishmael, Nethaniah's son, straight up killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. And guess what? Gedaliah was the governor of the land appointed by the king of Babylon himself. Crazy, right?"
Jeremiah,42,1,"So, like, all the top leaders, plus this dude Johanan and another dude Jezaniah, and literally everyone from the smallest to the biggest, all came together,"
Jeremiah,42,2,"Jeremiah, dude, we gotta ask you something. Can you like, pray to the LORD your God for us and all the peeps that are left? We're just a small group now, as you can totally see. So, um, yeah, please put in a good word for us! 🙏"
Jeremiah,42,3,So that God can show us how we should navigate our path and what actions we should take.
Jeremiah,42,4,"So Jeremiah, being the prophet, was like, 'Yo, I heard you guys loud and clear. I'm gonna go and pray to the LORD your God just like you asked. And whatever He tells me, I'll straight up tell you everything without holding back any info.'"
Jeremiah,42,5,"They were like, 'Yo, Jeremiah, may the LORD be a legit and trustworthy witness between us. If we don't do everything that the LORD your God sends you to tell us, then may we be called out on it.'"
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it's cool or not, we're gonna follow what the LORD our God says, yo. We're sending you this message, so that things will go smoothly when we listen to the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,42,7,"So, like, after ten days, the LORD dropped a message to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,42,8,"So he called Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the squad leaders who were hanging out with him, and all the peeps from the smallest to the biggest."
Jeremiah,42,9,"And I told them, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the ones who sent me to present your request before him;"
Jeremiah,42,10,"If you guys stay in this place, I'll totally make you thrive instead of tear you down. I'll totally establish you and not uproot you, 'cause I feel really bad about all the bad stuff I've done to you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"No need to freak out about the king of Babylon, the one y'all are scared of. Don't worry, says the LORD. 'Cause I got your back, ready to rescue you and free you from his grip."
Jeremiah,42,12,"And I'll hook you up with some mad blessings, so you can get blessed and head back to your own turf."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you're like, 'Nah, we're not into living in this place, and we're not down to listen to the Big Man upstairs, the LORD your God,'"
Jeremiah,42,14,"They were like, 'Nah, let's head to Egypt instead. It's all chill there—no wars, no trumpet sounds, no bread shortage. We can totally settle down over there."
Jeremiah,42,15,"Yo, listen up, the message from the LORD goes out to you, the leftover crew from Judah. This is what the LORD of all, the God of Israel, is saying: If you're dead set on heading over to Egypt and crashing there for a while,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"Bruh, listen up. You know that sword you were all scared of? Well, it's gonna catch up to you in Egypt, and that famine you were so afraid of? It'll be right on your heels, right there in Egypt. And guess what? That's where you're gonna meet your end. It's gonna cling to you, fam."
Jeremiah,42,17,"The same will happen to all the dudes who are dead set on heading to Egypt for a holiday; they're gonna get wrecked by swords, famine, and diseases. There won't be a single one who survives or gets away from the disaster I'm gonna bring upon them. #sorrynotsorry"
Jeremiah,42,18,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Almighty God of Israel is saying: Just like I unleashed my anger and fury on the peeps of Jerusalem, I'm gonna do the same to you when you head to Egypt. Y'all gonna be straight up cursed, mind-blown, and hated, never gonna see this place again."
Jeremiah,42,19,"Listen up, yo! The LORD has a message for all of you, the leftover crew from Judah. Don't even think about heading to Egypt, fam. Seriously, take note that I'm warning you right now, no doubt about it. #Testifyin"
Jeremiah,42,20,"So, like, you were totally hiding your true intentions deep down inside when you asked me to go to the LORD your God and be all like, 'Hey, pray for us to the LORD our God!' You were all like, 'We promise to do whatever the LORD our God says, so just tell us!' But really, you were being sneaky and trying to deceive yourselves, fam."
Jeremiah,42,21,"So, like, I just told you exactly what's up, but you straight up didn't listen to what the LORD your God was saying, or like, anything that He sent me to tell you. It's a major bummer, dudes."
Jeremiah,42,22,"So like, just know for sure that you're gonna face some serious trouble. Like, we're talking about sword stabbings, hunger struggles, and some major diseases, all in the place where you wanna go and hang out. Just saying, man."
Jeremiah,43,1,"So, like, when Jeremiah finished talking to all the peeps and dropped all the words of the Lord their God that He sent him to say, these were all the words."
Jeremiah,43,2,"Azariah, Hoshaiah's son, Johanan, Kareah's son, and all those arrogant dudes, they said to Jeremiah, 'You're lying, dude! God didn't send you to tell us not to go to Egypt and live there.'"
Jeremiah,43,3,"Yo, Baruch, Neriah's son, is totally trying to turn you against us, so the Chaldeans can take us out and drag us off as prisoners to Babylon for good. Like, not cool, dude!"
Jeremiah,43,4,"But Johanan, Kareah's son, and all the squad leaders, and everyone else, didn't listen to what the LORD had to say about staying in Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,"Yo, Johanan, Kareah's kid, and all the squad leaders rounded up the leftover crew from Judah who made it back from all over the place they got scattered, and brought them back to chill in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,6,"So basically, there were guys, girls, kids, even the king's daughters, and basically everyone that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had chilled with Gedaliah sonn of Ahikam, son of Shaphan). Oh, and also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch sonn of Neriah)."
Jeremiah,43,7,So they went to Egypt because they didn't listen to what the LORD said. This is how they ended up in Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,"Yo, God spoke to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes like this,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"Grab some huge stones and stash them in the clay at the brick factory, right by the front of Pharaoh's crib in Tahpanhes, where all the peeps from Judah can see."
Jeremiah,43,10,"Yo, listen up, this is from the LORD, the Almighty, the God of Israel. Check it, I'm gonna send for Nebuchadrezzar, the boss of Babylon, 'cause yo, he's my servant. I'm gonna have him roll up to these hidden stones and set up his throne on 'em. And he's gonna flaunt his royal pavilion over 'em like a boss."
Jeremiah,43,11,"And when he comes, he's gonna totally wreck Egypt, like seriously. Like, those who gotta go down will go down, those who gotta be captured will be captured, and those who gotta face the sword, they'll face it."
Jeremiah,43,12,"And I'm gonna start a serious fire in those Egyptian god houses; they'll be burnt to a crisp and taken away as captives. I'll totally rock the land of Egypt like a boss, just like a shepherd puts on his cool outfit. And I'll peace out of there, no drama."
Jeremiah,43,13,"He's gonna totally wreck those statues of Bethshemesh in Egypt, and he's gonna light up the houses of the Egyptian gods with fire. Yeah, those statues, they're gonna be history! And Bethshemesh? More like the house of the sun, but not for long!"
Jeremiah,44,1,"So, Jeremiah got a message from God about all the Jewish peeps who are living it up in Egypt, specifically in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros. Here's what God said:"
Jeremiah,44,2,"Yo, listen up y'all! The big man upstairs, the God of Israel, got somethin' to say. Y'all peeped all the messed up stuff I did to Jerusalem and the other cities in Judah, right? Well, check it out, today those places are straight-up abandoned and empty. Ain't nobody livin' there no more."
Jeremiah,44,3,"Yo, they seriously messed up when they decided to do all that crazy stuff that made me super angry. Like, they went and started burning incense and worshipping all these other gods that they didn't even know anything about. And get this, not just them, but neither you nor your ancestors knew about those gods either."
Jeremiah,44,4,"Yo, I've straight up sent all my servants, the prophets, to you. I've been waking up mad early and hitting send, being like, yo, don't even think about doing this disgusting thing that I straight up detest."
Jeremiah,44,5,But they didn't listen and ignored the fact that they should stop being wicked and not worship other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,"So, yeah, my anger totally exploded and got crazy intense in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. And now they're all ruined and deserted, just like they are right now."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD, the Almighty God of Israel, has to say: Why are you doing this seriously messed up thing and hurting yourselves? You're basically wiping out everyone from Judah - men, women, kids, babies - no one left. Straight up devastating!"
Jeremiah,44,8,"So, like, you know how you totally make me mad with all the stuff you do? Like, offering incense to other gods while you're living in Egypt? It's like you're trying to separate yourselves and become a major embarrassment and disappointment to all the nations around you. Not cool, guys."
Jeremiah,44,9,"Yo, y'all remember how messed up your ancestors were, and how the kings of Judah and their wives were wicked too? Not to mention your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives. They did all sorts of messed up stuff in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,44,10,"Dude, they still haven't shown any humility, bro. They haven't even shown any respect or followed my rules and laws that I gave to you and your ancestors. (humbled: in Hebrew it means being sorry)"
Jeremiah,44,11,"So, like, this is what the LORD, the boss of the heavenly crew, the God of Israel, is saying, you know? Listen up, cuz I'm about to get real with you. I'm gonna straight-up be against you, like really, really mad, and I'm gonna make sure all of Judah is wiped out."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I'll gather up the leftover people from Judah, who decided to go live in Egypt. Well, guess what? They're all gonna get wiped out in Egypt. Yes, you heard that right. They're gonna die by the sword and by famine, from the least important to the most important. They're gonna become a big ol' curse and a total embarrassment."
Jeremiah,44,13,"Yo, I'm gonna straight up drop some consequences on those peeps chilling in Egypt, just like I did to Jerusalem. It's gonna be a combo of sword, famine, and sickness. No joke."
Jeremiah,44,14,"So basically, none of the leftover people from Judah who went to Egypt to hang out there will be able to escape or stay behind. They won't be able to go back to Judah like they want to, except for the ones who manage to escape. Yeah, they really want to live there again, you know? But only a select few will make it back."
Jeremiah,44,15,"So, like, all the dudes who found out that their wives were, like, worshiping other gods and all the women who were there too, there were so many people, including everyone who lived in Egypt and Pathros, they all spoke up to Jeremiah and were like,"
Jeremiah,44,16,"Yo, we're not vibing with what you're saying in the name of the LORD, so we won't be listening, fam."
Jeremiah,44,17,"But we're totally gonna do whatever we want, like burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her. We've been doing it for ages, just like our parents, rulers, and leaders in Judah and Jerusalem. It seemed to work out fine for us—we had plenty to eat, everything was chill, and we didn't have to deal with any bad stuff."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But, like, ever since we stopped worshipping the queen of heaven and giving her fancy drinks and stuff, we've been totally lacking and getting wrecked by sword fights and hunger."
Jeremiah,44,19,"So, like, we used to light up some incense for the queen of heaven, and we even offered her drinks, you know? We even made these special cakes just to worship her and offered drinks to show our devotion. And, by the way, we totally did all of this with our guys' knowledge and approval, you feel me? (or husbands, if you wanna get technical)"
Jeremiah,44,20,"So Jeremiah was like, yo, listen up everyone! This message is for all you guys and gals who gave him that response:"
Jeremiah,44,21,"Yo, did the Lord not even remember the incense y'all burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? Like, it didn't even cross His mind, even though you, your parents, the kings, the princes, and all the people were doing it."
Jeremiah,44,22,"The Lord couldn't take it anymore, your evil actions and terrible things you've done. That's why your land is all messed up and cursed, with no one living there. It's like a total ghost town, just like today."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Yo, y'all be burning them incenses, straight up sinning against the Almighty, not even listening to His voice, or following His laws, statutes, or testimonies. That's why all this bad stuff is going down right now, you feel me?"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Yo, Jeremiah talked to everyone, including the ladies. Listen up, all the peeps in Egypt, this is a message from the LORD."
Jeremiah,44,25,"Yo, this is what the big man upstairs, the God of Israel is sayin': You and your partners in crime, y'all been talkin' the talk and walkin' the walk, sayin' you're gonna keep your promises to worship the queen of heaven and offer her drinks. Well guess what? You're totally gonna follow through on those vows, no doubt about it."
Jeremiah,44,26,"Yo, listen up, fam! This message goes out to all the squad repping Judah in Egypt. Imma drop some truth here straight from the LORD. Check it, I've made a solid oath by my epic name, says the LORD, that no one from Judah in Egypt will be throwing around my name anymore, saying stuff like 'The Lord GOD is alive'."
Jeremiah,44,27,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna keep a close eye on those dudes, but it won't be for anything good. All those guys from Judah who are chilling in Egypt? Yeah, they're gonna get wrecked by the sword and hunger until there's none of them left. It's gonna be a rough ride, my friend."
Jeremiah,44,28,"But only a few who manage to avoid being killed will come back from Egypt to Judah. And all the surviving people from Judah who went to live in Egypt will finally realize whose words will come true, mine or theirs."
Jeremiah,44,29,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs just dropped a sign on y'all. He's straight up saying that he's gonna bring down some serious punishment right here, so you better take note. This is to show you that when He speaks, He means business and His words will definitely come true, even if it's bad news for you."
Jeremiah,44,30,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD says: Check it out, I'm gonna hand over Pharaohhophra, the king of Egypt, to his enemies and to those who wanna take his life, just like I handed over Zedekiah, the king of Judah, to Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, who was his enemy and was after his life."
Jeremiah,45,1,"So, like, here's what went down: Jeremiah, this total prophet, was talking to Baruch, Neriah's kid. And get this, he wrote it all down in a book while Jeremiah was just laying down the truth. It all went down in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, Josiah's son and the king of Judah. This is what Jeremiah had to say, man:"
Jeremiah,45,2,"Hey Baruch, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, wants to tell you:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"I was like, OMG, everything is so terrible right now! I feel super sad and the LORD just keeps piling on more stuff for me to deal with. I'm completely exhausted from all the sighing and I can't find any peace anywhere."
Jeremiah,45,4,"So, like, tell him this, God's like, 'Yo, check it out, what I've built, I'm totally gonna tear it down, and what I've planted, I'm gonna straight-up uproot it. This whole land, man, it's gonna get wrecked.'"
Jeremiah,45,5,"Yo, you out here chasing big things for yourself or what? Nah, not a good look. Check it, I'm about to bring some major trouble to everyone, says the LORD. But listen up, I got your back. Your life? Yeah, I'm gonna make sure you come out on top wherever you go."
Jeremiah,46,1,"So, like, the message from the LORD that came to Jeremiah, the prophet, about these non-Jewish peeps;"
Jeremiah,46,2,"So, like, Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, totally attacked Pharaohnecho's army in Carchemish by the river Euphrates. This all went down in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, the king of Judah, just fyi."
Jeremiah,46,3,"Yo, grab your shield and armor up, time to get ready for battle."
Jeremiah,46,4,"Yo, saddle up them horses, callin' all horse dudes, gear up with your helmets, polish them spears, and suit up in brigandines."
Jeremiah,46,5,"Why did I see them so shaken and running away? Their strong ones have been defeated, fleeing quickly without looking back because they were surrounded by fear, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,46,6,"Don't let the fast ones bolt or the strong ones slip away; they're gonna trip and fall up by the river Euphrates, heading north."
Jeremiah,46,7,"Yo, who's that rollin' in like a straight-up tsunami, with water flowin' like powerful rivers?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt be like a massive wave, and its waters be flowing like rivers; and Egypt be like, 'Yo, I'm gonna rise up and totally flood the entire land; I'm gonna wreck the city and all its peeps.'"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Yo, horses, let's ride! Chariots, rev up! Watch out for the badass warriors from Ethiopia and Libya, skilled in shield combat. And don't forget the bow-wielding Lydians!"
Jeremiah,46,10,"Yo, this is the day when the Lord God, the ultimate boss, is coming for revenge. He's gonna make sure his enemies get what they deserve. The sword is gonna go wild, chomping down on their blood until it's had its fill. The Lord God, the ultimate boss, is even planning a massive sacrifice up north by the Euphrates River."
Jeremiah,46,11,"Yo, head up to Gilead and grab some balm, oh young queen of Egypt. But no matter how many meds you use, they won't do squat. Sorry, but there's no cure for you."
Jeremiah,46,12,"All the countries have caught wind of your embarrassment, and your cry has blown up social media: because the popular dude tripped over another popular dude, and now they're both cancelled."
Jeremiah,46,13,"This is what God said to Jeremiah the prophet, that Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, was gonna come and totally wreck Egypt."
Jeremiah,46,14,"Yo, spread the word in Egypt. Share the news in Migdol, Noph, and Tahpanhes. Tell everyone to stay strong and get ready because danger is coming from all sides. The sword is gonna wreck havoc, man."
Jeremiah,46,15,Why did your strong and brave crew get wiped out? They didn't stand a chance because the LORD pushed them away.
Jeremiah,46,16,"He caused a lot of people to stumble, like one person falling on top of another. They said, 'Let's get up and go back to our own peeps and the place where we were born, away from this sword that's hurting us.'"
Jeremiah,46,17,"LOL they were like, 'OMG, Pharaoh king of Egypt is such a joke! He couldn't even meet the deadline.'"
Jeremiah,46,18,"I swear, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, just like how Tabor is the coolest mountain ever and Carmel is the sickest spot by the sea, that's exactly how he's gonna come."
Jeremiah,46,19,"Hey, girl in Egypt, get ready to be taken captive. The city of Noph will be totally abandoned and deserted. (By the way, 'instruments of captivity' means stuff that they'll use to take you away.)"
Jeremiah,46,20,"Egypt be lookin' real fine like a fresh heifer, but oh snap, destruction be rollin' in from the north."
Jeremiah,46,21,"The people she paid to work for her are like well-fed bulls in the middle of her, but even they have given up and run away together. They couldn't stand their ground because their day of trouble had arrived, and the time for them to face the consequences of their actions."
Jeremiah,46,22,"Dude, their voice will be slitherin' like a serpent. They'll roll through with a whole army, swingin' their axes like they're choppin' wood."
Jeremiah,46,23,"The Lord said they gonna chop down that forest, but it's gonna be impossible to find all the spots 'cause there's like more of them than grasshoppers, like a crazy amount."
Jeremiah,46,24,Egypt's girl be shook; she gonna be handed over to the peeps from up north.
Jeremiah,46,25,"Yo fam, listen up! The big man upstairs, the OG of Israel, is like, 'Yo, check it out. I'm about to lay down some serious punishment on No, Pharaoh, and Egypt, along with their gods and kings. Even Pharaoh himself and all his homies who be puttin' their faith in him. Just so you know, multitudee' in Hebrew actually means 'nourisher', in case you were wondering."
Jeremiah,46,26,"And I'm gonna give them over to those who wanna kill them, and to Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and his crew. But don't worry, afterwards, it's gonna get all populated again, just like in the good ol' days, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,46,27,"Don't stress, yo, my homie Jacob, and don't be freaked out, O Israel.

This is what the prophet Jeremiah told Seraiah, son of Neriah and grandson of Maaseiah, when he rolled with King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylon in his fourth year of ruling. Seraiah was a chill dude, like a low-key prince or something, holding it down for the peaceful peeps. P.S. He was also known as the boss chamberlain."
Jeremiah,51,60,"So Jeremiah was like, yeah, I'm gonna write down all the bad stuff that's comin' for Babylon, like all these words that totally throw shade at Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,61,"Jeremiah was like, 'Yo, Seraiah, when you reach Babylon, take a look around and read all these words, fam."
Jeremiah,51,62,"Yo, Lord, You straight up have spoken against this place, saying it's gonna be totally wiped out, with no one left, not even animals. It's gonna be deserted for real, like forever. {desolate: in Hebrew it means desolations}"

Jeremiah,51,64,"And you'll be like, yo, Babylon's gonna straight up sink, like there's no comin' back from the bad stuff I'm 'bout to unleash on 'em. They gonna be so exhausted. That's all, Jeremiah out."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he started being the king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Hamutal, and she was the daughter of Jeremiah from the city of Libnah."
Jeremiah,52,2,"And he straight up did some messed up stuff in the LORD's eyes, just like Jehoiakim had done."
Jeremiah,52,3,"So, because the LORD was really fed up, something went down in Jerusalem and Judah. He straight up kicked them out of his sight. And guess what? Zedekiah had the nerve to rebel against the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,4,"So like, in the ninth year he was ruling and it was in the tenth month, like specifically on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, showed up with his whole army and set up camp around Jerusalem, building forts and stuff around it."
Jeremiah,52,5,"So like, the city was under attack for a really long time, until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah's reign."
Jeremiah,52,6,"And, like, in the fourth month, on the ninth day, a major famine hit the city. It was so bad that the people of the land couldn't find any bread to eat."
Jeremiah,52,7,"So, like, the city got wrecked, and all the warriors hauled out in the dark through the gate between those two walls near the king's garden. FYI, the Chaldeans had surrounded the city, but the warriors dipped out through the plain."
Jeremiah,52,8,"But then the Chaldeans totally went after the king, and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his squad just straight up scattered and bailed on him."
Jeremiah,52,9,"So, they grabbed the king and brought him to the king of Babylon in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment against him."
Jeremiah,52,10,And the king of Babylon straight up killed Zedekiah's sons right in front of him. He also killed all the top dogs of Judah in Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,11,"After that, Zedekiah got his eyes messed up; the king of Babylon captured him, put him in chains, and sent him to Babylon where he was locked up till the day he died."
Jeremiah,52,12,"So, like, in the fifth month and on the tenth day, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who was really loyal to the king, came to Jerusalem. Yeah, he was like the boss of all the executioners and stuff."
Jeremiah,52,13,"And totally lit up the crib of the LORD, the king's crib, and all the cribs in Jerusalem, including the cribs of the influencers, he totally torched them with fire."
Jeremiah,52,14,"And, like, the entire gang of Chaldeans, rollin' deep with their leader, straight-up demolished all the walls surrounding Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,15,"So this dude Nebuzaradan, who was like the head honcho of the guards, straight up grabbed some of the poor peeps who were left in the city and those who switched sides and bowed down to the king of Babylon, along with the rest of the crowd."
Jeremiah,52,16,"So like, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, he was chill and he left some of the poor folks in the land to work as vineyard peeps and farmers and stuff."
Jeremiah,52,17,"So, the cool brass pillars that were in the house of the LORD, along with the bases and the awesome brass sea, the Chaldeans totally wrecked and took all the brass to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"They also took away the cool kitchen tools, the cleaning scoops, the snazzy lighters, the fancy bowls, the stylish spoons, and all the brass utensils they used to do their holy tasks. {shovels: or, tools to sweep away the ashes} {bowls: or, fancy basin sinks}"
Jeremiah,52,19,"The captain of the guard snatched the gold and silver basins, firepans, bowls, cauldrons, candlesticks, spoons, and cups. He took everything made of gold and silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"So, there were these two huge pillars, a massive ocean-like basin, and twelve bronze bulls that King Solomon made for the LORD's house. Can you believe it? The weight of all that brass was off the charts, literally!"
Jeremiah,52,21,"So, like, these pillars were, like, super tall, okay? One pillar was, like, eighteen cubits high, and it had this cool decorative thingy that went around it, it was, like, twelve cubits long. Oh, and the pillar was, like, four fingers thick, and it had a hollow inside. Pretty awesome, right? #architecture"
Jeremiah,52,22,"There was this sick brass topper on it, and each topper was five cubits tall. They had these super cool brass decorations like nets and pomegranates all around. The second pillar and the pomegranate decorations were just as rad as the first one."
Jeremiah,52,23,"And there were like, 96 pomegranates on each side, you know? And all the pomegranates on the cool net thingy were like a total of 100, like, all around."
Jeremiah,52,24,"Then the leader of the guards grabbed Seraiah, the top priest, along with Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three doorkeepers: {door: means the threshold in Hebrew}"
Jeremiah,52,25,"He also took with him a eunuch who was in charge of the soldiers in the city, along with seven dudes who were close to the king; they were all found in the city. He also grabbed the main guy who was keeping track of the people in the land's army, and sixty other dudes from the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,"Then Nebuzaradan, the head honcho of the squad, grabbed them and hauled them all the way to the king of Babylon in Riblah."
Jeremiah,52,27,"So, like, the king of Babylon totally wrecked them and wiped them out in Riblah, a place in the land of Hamath. And, like, as a result, Judah got taken away as prisoners from their own land, you know?"
Jeremiah,52,28,"So, like, Nebuchadrezzar casually took three thousand Jews and twenty-three of them captive in the seventh year, you know?"
Jeremiah,52,29,"In the 18th year of Nebuchadrezzar, he took about 832 people as captives from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,30,"In the 23rd year of Nebuchadrezzar, this guy Nebuzaradan, who was the captain of the guard, took away 745 Jews as captives. The total number of people taken was 4,600."
Jeremiah,52,31,"So, like, after Jehoiachin king of Judah had been in captivity for 37 years, and in the twelfth month on the 25th day, this dude Evilmerodach, who just became king of Babylon, decided to release Jehoiachin from prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,"And he was hella nice to him, and put him in charge, like, above all the other kings in Babylon, you know? +1 for being cool..."
Jeremiah,52,33,"And he swapped his prison clothes to something fresh, always had his snacks on deck, munching on bread non-stop throughout his entire life."
Jeremiah,52,34,"And as for his meals, the king of Babylon provided him with a daily portion throughout his whole life, until the day he passed away. It was a constant supply that never ran out."
Lamentations,1,1,"Yo, the city used to be lit with people everywhere, but now it's sitting all alone. It's like she's gone from being popular to feeling like a widow. She used to be a boss among other nations, a total queen among the provinces, and now she's just falling under their control!"
Lamentations,1,2,"She's crying so much at night, with tears streaming down her face. None of her lovers are there to comfort her. Even her friends have betrayed her and turned into enemies."
Lamentations,1,3,Judah got captured due to all the hardships and being forced to serve others. Now she's living among foreigners and can't catch a break. Her enemies chased her down and trapped her in a tight spot.

Lamentations,1,5,"OMG, her haters are totally flexing and her enemies are straight up thriving; bummer 'cause the LORD punished her big time for all the bad stuff she did. Now her fam is like held captive by the enemies. SMH."
Lamentations,1,6,"And like, the daughter of Zion has totally lost all her beauty, you know? Her princes are like, deer that can't find any food, and they're just weak and unable to escape from the one chasing them."
Lamentations,1,7,"Jerusalem, in the tough times she went through, remembered all the dope things she had back in the good old days. But when her people were messed up by the enemy and nobody had her back, her adversaries straight up clowned her on her chill times."
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem messed up big time; so now she's out of the picture. All the people who used to think highly of her now look down on her because they saw her vulnerable and ashamed. Yeah, she's feeling regretful and going backwards."
Lamentations,1,9,"She's got all that dirtiness going on in her skirts and doesn't even remember what's gonna happen to her in the end. So, no surprise she's going down in a pretty spectacular way, with no one to comfort her. Yo, God, check out how much I'm suffering, 'cause the enemy's all puffed up and acting all big."
Lamentations,1,10,"Bruh, the enemy be wreckin' everything that used to bring joy to her. Like, those non-believers straight up invaded her sacred space, even though You specifically told them to stay away from Your people. Like, seriously?"

Lamentations,1,14,"Bruh, I'm totally messed up because of my wrongdoings. It's like this heavy burden that God is holding onto and it's all wrapped around my neck. It's made me weak and helpless. The Lord has totally left me at the mercy of those who have power over me and there's legit no way I can get out of it."
Lamentations,1,15,"Bruh, the Lord straight up wrecked all my homies, like, in the middle of our crew. He gathered a squad to totally crush the youngins. It's like the Lord stomped on Judah's girl, treating her like grapes in a winepress. Crazy stuff, man!"

Listen up, fam, I'm talking to all you peeps out there — check out this deep sorrow I'm going through. Like, my girls and guys, all of 'em, have been taken as captives. No joke, man. (P.S. When I say 'command,' I mean, like, wordd' or something.)"

They're just crumbling together. 💔"
Lamentations,2,9,"The city's gates are totally wrecked and useless; they're all gone, smashed and ruined. The ruler, along with the important people, are now scattered out among other nations.

Lamentations,2,15,"Everyone who walks by can't help but start clapping and then they start hissing and shaking their head in disbelief at the daughter of Jerusalem. They're like, 'Is this the city they used to call the epitome of beauty, the absolute joy of the whole world?'"
Lamentations,2,16,"Your haters are all coming at you, talking trash and showing their disrespect. They're making hissing sounds and grinding their teeth, feeling all proud and saying, 'We totally destroyed them this time! This is exactly what we've been waiting for, we got what we wanted!'"
Lamentations,2,17,"God did what He planned; He kept His word that He gave a long time ago. He brought destruction without mercy, and let your enemies have the upper hand. He empowered those who oppose you."
Lamentations,2,18,"They poured out their emotions to the Lord, hey wall of the daughter of Zion, let the tears flow like a river all day and all night long. Don't even take a break, keep on going without stopping, because your loved ones should always be a priority."

Lamentations,2,20,"Yo, LORD, check it out and think about what you've done here. Are we seriously talking about babies and little kids being completely wiped out? And as if that's not enough, are You gonna let the religious leaders, like the priests and prophets, get killed right in Your holy place? Seriously, are You okay with that? Like, are they gonna be 'swaddled with their hands' or what?"

Lamentations,3,5,"He's totally hatin' on me, like he's all up in my face with his negativity and stressin' me out."
Lamentations,3,6,"He's put me in places so dark, like the ones who've been dead for ages."
Lamentations,3,7,"Dude, God put me in a total lockdown and made it impossible for me to escape. My freedom has been crushed, man."
Lamentations,3,8,"Even when I'm like crying and screaming, he ignores my prayers."
Lamentations,3,9,"My ways are like, totally blocked off with these solid stone barriers, and my paths are, like, all twisty and messed up."
Lamentations,3,10,He was like a stealthy bear and a hidden lion to me.
Lamentations,3,11,He's completely messed up my plans and torn me apart: I feel utterly destroyed.
Lamentations,3,12,He pulled out his bow and decided to use me as a target for his arrow.
Lamentations,3,13,He shot his arrows straight to the core of my being. {arrows: lit. sons}
Lamentations,3,14,I was a total laughingstock to everyone I knew; they used to make jokes about me all the time.
Lamentations,3,15,"He made me feel bitter AF, like, seriously, I can't even. It's like he spiked my drink with straight-up wormwood, man. No joke, that bitterness hit me hard. And I'm not just talking about regular bitterness, I'm talking about next-level bitternesses, you know what I'm saying?"

Lamentations,3,25,"OMG, the LORD is so awesome to those who have patience and are like totally seeking Him with all their heart and soul!"
Lamentations,3,26,It's actually pretty rad when someone has hope and patiently chills for the LORD to come through with salvation.
Lamentations,3,27,It's legit beneficial for a guy to handle responsibilities while he's still young.
Lamentations,3,28,"He sits alone in silence, carrying the weight on his shoulders."
Lamentations,3,29,"He humbles himself, going low-key; just maybe, there's a glimmer of hope."
Lamentations,3,30,"He's willing to take the hits without retaliating, even when they're unfair. He deals with all the shame and humiliation, like, he's not bothered by it."
Lamentations,3,31,"Cuz God ain't gonna ditch us forever, fam:"
Lamentations,3,32,"Even though he may make us feel sad, he will still show us compassion and kindness, because he's got a whole bunch of love and mercy to go around!"
Lamentations,3,33,"Yo, just so you know, God ain't out here trying to cause trouble or make us sad. He ain't doing it just for kicks, feel me?"
Lamentations,3,34,"To totally dominate and defeat all the losers in the world,"
Lamentations,3,35,To disrespect someone's rights in front of the most High
Lamentations,3,36,"God isn't cool with messing up someone's case, He's not into that. {seeth not: or, doesn't like it}"
Lamentations,3,37,"Like, who does this person think they are, saying stuff and expecting it to happen, when it's not even what the Lord wants to go down?"

Lamentations,3,41,"Yo, let's raise our vibes and show some love to God up in the sky. 🙌💖"
Lamentations,3,42,We messed up big time and went against the rules: you didn't let it slide.
Lamentations,3,43,"You've totally lost it and come after us with your rage, going as far as taking lives without any mercy."

Lamentations,3,54,"Dude, I was overwhelmed by all these problems; and I just went like, 'Bro, I'm totally screwed!'"
Lamentations,3,55,"Yo, I straight up called out to you, LORD, from the deepest, darkest dungeon."
Lamentations,3,56,"You heard me, so don't ignore me when I talk or when I cry out."
Lamentations,3,57,"You came through when I reached out to you: You were like, 'Don't stress, it's all good.'"
Lamentations,3,58,"Hey God, you totally got my back and saved me from all the drama in my life."
Lamentations,3,59,"Yo, God, you've peeped my situation, so lay down your verdict on my behalf."
Lamentations,3,60,"Yo, you peeped all the revenge and crazy thoughts they be havin' against me."

Lamentations,3,62,"These haters be talkin' trash 'bout me and plottin' against me all day, man."
Lamentations,3,63,Check out how they chill and how they flex; I'm their ultimate vibe.
Lamentations,3,64,"God, give them what they deserve based on their actions."
Lamentations,3,65,"Make them feel hella sad and cursed, like their hearts are straight up broken. Like, not just sad, but stubbornly refusing to change their ways kinda sad."
Lamentations,3,66,"Totally cancel and wreck them in furious mode, straight from the skies of the Almighty One."
Lamentations,4,1,"OMG, have you seen the gold lately? It's like so not shiny anymore! And like, the super expensive gold? Total glow down! The precious stones from the holy place are all scattered around on every street. It's like a major style disaster, I can't even!"
Lamentations,4,2,"OMG, the dudes from Zion are legit like flex-worthy gold. But here's the sitch, peeps be treating them like basic clay pots made by the pottery artist!"
Lamentations,4,3,"Yo, even sea monsters take care of their babies and feed them; but the people in my crew have turned cold-hearted, just like wild ostriches in the desert."
Lamentations,4,4,"When a baby is super thirsty, their tongue gets all sticky and stuck to the roof of their mouth. And you know what's sad? Even little kids asking for bread don't get anyone to give it to them."
Lamentations,4,5,"Those who were living the good life are now left struggling in the streets, while those who were always surrounded by luxury are now left in the dirt."
Lamentations,4,6,"TBH, the consequences of my peoples' mistakes hit harder than the punishment Sodom got when it was destroyed in a snap, no one could even defend it. #realtalk"
Lamentations,4,7,"Yo, her Nazarites were fresher than snow, they were purer than milk, they were glowing with a sick ruby-like redness, and their vibe was as polished as sapphire:"
Lamentations,4,8,"They look darker than a coal, you won't see them in the streets, their skin sticks to their bones, it's all dried up and looks like a stick."
Lamentations,4,9,"Those who are killed by a sword got it better than those who starve to death because they waste away, devastated by the lack of food from the fields. (waste away: like, super weak)"
Lamentations,4,10,The moms who should have shown compassion have done the unthinkable. They cooked their own babies and ate them while our people were being destroyed.
Lamentations,4,11,"God unleashed his wrath; he let out his intense anger, and started a fire in Zion that completely consumed its very core."
Lamentations,4,12,The peeps in charge and everyone on the planet couldn't even fathom the enemy sneaking into Jerusalem like that. It was too wild!
Lamentations,4,13,"Because of the mistakes made by her influencers, and the bad actions of her spiritual leaders, who have caused innocent people to suffer in her midst,"
Lamentations,4,14,"They've been lost, stumbling around the streets like clueless peeps, defiling themselves with violence, to the point where others couldn't even come near them without getting tainted."
Lamentations,4,15,"They yelled at them, saying 'Go away, it's gross, get out of here, don't touch us!' When they ran away and were lost, they told the non-believers that they would never stay there again. They were considered defiled."
Lamentations,4,16,God got super mad at them and that caused a huge divide. He's not gonna pay attention to them anymore because they didn't show respect to the priests and didn't care about the elders either. God was not happy at all.
Lamentations,4,17,"Like, seriously, we were so desperate and our hopes were totally in vain. We were basically on high alert, keeping our eyes peeled for a nation that couldn't even come close to rescuing us."
Lamentations,4,18,"They're constantly following us, making it impossible to be out in our own neighborhoods. The end is so close now, our time is up; there's no denying it."
Lamentations,4,19,"Our haters be faster than them heaven eagles: they chased us up them mountains, waitin' for us in the wild."
Lamentations,4,20,"Bruh, the one who's like the essence of our lives, chosen by the LORD, got caught up in their schemes. We were all like, 'Chillin' under this dude's protection is how we survive in this crazy world.'"
Lamentations,4,21,"Be happy and excited, oh fellow Gen Zer from Edom who lives in the land of Uz. The time will come when you'll be in the spotlight and experience the consequences of your actions. You'll let loose, go wild, and reveal your true self."
Lamentations,4,22,"Yo, the consequences of your wrongdoings are totally over, girl from Zion. You won't be taken captive anymore. But hold up, daughter of Edom, your sins will be called out and brought to light. Can't hide 'em!"
Lamentations,5,1,"Yo, God, don't forget what's been happening to us: take a moment and check out the disrespect we've been getting."
Lamentations,5,2,"Bruh, our whole vibe got taken over by randoms. Like our houses are straight up occupied by total strangers. No cap."
Lamentations,5,3,"We're like totally parentless and fatherless, and our moms are basically widows."
Lamentations,5,4,We've been wasting our money on drinking water and even have to buy our own firewood. It's like nothing comes without a price in this messed up world.
Lamentations,5,5,"We're getting targeted nonstop, always grinding and never catching a break. It feels like we can't catch a breath."
Lamentations,5,6,We provided food for the Egyptians and Assyrians to satisfy them.
Lamentations,5,7,"Our parents messed up, and now we're paying for it with their wrongdoings."
Lamentations,5,8,"We've been bossed around by these servants, and there's no one who can save us from their control."
Lamentations,5,9,We risk our lives to secure that bread with the wild sword of the wilderness.
Lamentations,5,10,"We were super burnt, like an oven, because of the really bad famine. {terrible: or, terrors, or, storms}"
Lamentations,5,11,"They were out here totally disrespecting the ladies in Zion, and messing with the girls in the cities of Judah."
Lamentations,5,12,The rich and powerful get cancelled publicly; even the wise and experienced don't get the respect they deserve.
Lamentations,5,13,"They made the young ones do all the grinding, and the little ones got stuck with heavy logs."
Lamentations,5,14,"The old heads have dipped from the hangout spot, the homies have paused their bops."
Lamentations,5,15,"Bruh, our happiness is totally gone; our lit dance moves have straight up turned into straight up sadness."
Lamentations,5,16,"Our crown has been literally snatched off our heads, bro. We're so screwed, man! It's like major bad news because we've totally messed up, you know? Like, our whole head thing is ruined and it's a big deal, fam."
Lamentations,5,17,Our heart can't handle this; our eyes are so tired from all of this.
Lamentations,5,18,"Yo, peep Zion Mountain, it's straight up deserted. Foxes be strolling all over that place."
Lamentations,5,19,"Yo, LORD, you're eternal, your throne's been here since forever and for every new gen."
Lamentations,5,20,"Why you gotta ghost us forever and leave us hanging for so long? Like, seriously? How much longer are we gonna wait for you to come through?"
Lamentations,5,21,"Yo, God, help us get back on track with you, and we'll totally turn ourselves around; bring back those good old days for us."
Lamentations,5,22,"Bruh, you straight up ghosted us; you're hella pissed at us. {But...: or like, For real, are you gonna completely ditch us?}"
Ezekiel,1,1,"So, like, this happened when I was thirty years old in, like, the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was chilling with the other peeps who were captive by the river of Chebar. And then, boom! The heavens opened up and I had these epic visions of God. It was wild, dude!"
Ezekiel,1,2,"On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,"
Ezekiel,1,3,"Yo, listen up! This sick message from the man upstairs, the LORD, came straight to Ezekiel the priest, Buzi's son, while he was in the land of the Chaldeans chillin' by the river Chebar. The LORD's power was totally on point and strong with him, no doubt. (P.S. Ezekiel is Hebrew for Jehezkel. Just so you know.)"
Ezekiel,1,4,"So, like, I saw this crazy thing, man. From the north, there was this gnarly whirlwind, a huge cloud, and a fire that was all twisted and stuff. And it was super bright, with this amber-like color coming from the fire. It was like the fire was catching itself or something, you know?"
Ezekiel,1,5,"And then in the middle there, there was these four living creature vibes. And let me tell you, they looked straight up like humans."
Ezekiel,1,6,"And yo, each one had four faces, and each one had four wings, no cap."
Ezekiel,1,7,"And their feet were totally straight, just like a calf's foot. And their feet were all shiny and glimmered like burnished brass."
Ezekiel,1,8,"And they had these human-like hands under their wings on all four sides, and each of them had both faces and wings."
Ezekiel,1,9,Their wings were connected and they didn't turn as they moved; they all went in a straight line.
Ezekiel,1,10,"Yo, so here's the deal. These creatures had some epic faces. They rocked a human face and a lion face on the right side. And get this, they had an ox face on the left side. But wait, there's more! They even had an eagle face too, like whaaat?!"
Ezekiel,1,11,"And this is how they looked: their faces were on point, and their wings were flexed to the max; two wings of each were twinned with the others, and two wings covered their swaggy bodies. #DividedAbove"
Ezekiel,1,12,"And they all kept it real: wherever the vibes directed them, they followed without hesitation; and they never swerved from their path."
Ezekiel,1,13,"The living creatures looked lit af, ngl. They were like blazing coals and cool lamps, going up and down among them. The fire was hella bright, and lightning was shooting out from it."
Ezekiel,1,14,And the lit creatures zoomed back and forth like a mad epic TikTok dance.
Ezekiel,1,15,"So, like, I was looking at these amazing living creatures, right? And then I noticed this totally rad wheel on the earth next to them, and the wheel had four faces, man!"
Ezekiel,1,16,"The wheels looked like they were made of beryl, and all four of them were the same. They looked like wheels within wheels."
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they rolled out, they rolled on all fours and never changed direction."
Ezekiel,1,18,"Yo, their wheels were totally next level, like, insanely scary you know? And these wheels were legit covered in eyes, like all around, four in total. The eyes were like everywhere, man. (or, the strakes too, you know?)"
Ezekiel,1,19,"And like, when the cool creatures moved, the wheels totally moved with them. And when the creatures were lifted up off the ground, the wheels got lifted up too."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they followed along with it. The wheels lifted up right beside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When the first group moved, the second group moved too; and when the first group stopped, the second group stopped as well; and when the first group lifted off the ground, the wheels also lifted up alongside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"And the sky above the heads of the living creature looked like a super cool crystal, totally mind-blowing, stretched out above them."
Ezekiel,1,23,"And under the dome, their wings were straight, facing each other: each had two wings that covered one side, and each had two wings that covered the other side, covering their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of massive waves, as the powerful voice, the voice of expression, like the sound of a large group: when they stood, they lowered their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And then, like, suddenly this voice came booming from the heavens above their heads, while they were all standing around with their wings out and stuff."
Ezekiel,1,26,"And above the cool space thingy that was over their heads, there was this throne thingy that looked like a super rad sapphire stone. And on the throne, there was this guy-like figure chilling on top of it."
Ezekiel,1,27,"And I saw this really cool thing that looked like amber and fire, surrounding this person from their waist up and down. It was like fire and super bright!"
Ezekiel,1,28,"Yo, like imagine seeing a rainbow on a rainy day - it's totally breathtaking, right? Well, that's kinda what the glory of the LORD looked like. I was so overwhelmed that I had to bow down and then I heard someone speaking!"
Ezekiel,2,1,"And then he was like, yo dude, get up off your butt and stand on your feet, 'cause I'm about to drop some wisdom on you."
Ezekiel,2,2,"And like, this really powerful vibe came over me when he started talking to me, and I was like totally energized and ready to go. It's like he lifted me up and made me feel so alive, man. And I was all ears, completely focused on hearing every word he said, because it was like he had my full attention."
Ezekiel,2,3,"Yo, bro! God was like, 'Listen up, homie. I'm sending you, the son of man, to the kids of Israel. Now, these peeps are rebellious AF. They've been rebelling against me, and their ancestors did the same, all the way up till now!"
Ezekiel,2,4,"These kids are so bold and stubborn, it's unreal. I'm sending you to them, and you gotta tell them what the Lord GOD says. (P.S. 'impudent' means 'hard of face' in case you were wondering)"
Ezekiel,2,5,"And, like, whether they wanna listen or not, (because they're so rebellious, ugh,) but they'll totally realize that there was, like, an actual prophet among them. Just saying."
Ezekiel,2,6,"Yo, bro, don't stress about these peeps or their words, even if they're prickly and toxic like briers and scorpions. Don't let their words get to you, and don't get freaked out by their attitude, even if they're being rebellious and difficult. Stay strong, fam!"
Ezekiel,2,7,"And you gotta like, totally, share what I'm saying to them, whether they actually listen or not, 'cause like, they're like super rebellious or whatever. And I mean, like, majorly rebellious, you know?"
Ezekiel,2,8,"Yo, dude! Listen up, son of man. Hear me out, okay? Don't be all rebellious like those guys in that rebellious house. Instead, open your mouth and chow down on the food I'm about to serve you!"
Ezekiel,2,9,"And I saw, like, this hand coming at me, and check it, there was a totally rad scroll of a book in it!"
Ezekiel,2,10,"He showed me the scroll, and it had writing on both sides - filled with expressions of sorrow, grief, and despair."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Yo, listen up! So, he said to me, 'Yo, dude, eat whatever you find. Eat this scroll and go speak to the fam in Israel.'"
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I was like, 'Oh, I'm hungry!' And then he gave me this awesome snack to munch on!"
Ezekiel,3,3,"And he was like, 'Yo, dude, eat up and fill your stomach with this scroll I'm giving you.' So I digested it, and bro, it tasted so sweet, like honey in my mouth."
Ezekiel,3,4,"So, like, He said to me, 'Yo, dude! Go to the house of Israel and, like, speak my words to them, you know.'"
Ezekiel,3,5,"Like, you're not being sent to some random people who speak differently and have a hard-to-understand slang. Nope, you're specifically sent to the Israelites - they might have a unique way of speaking, with their deep lip vibes and heavy tongue action. So, go connect with your peeps!"
Ezekiel,3,6,"Don't stress about chatting with people who speak differently and use lingo you're not familiar with. Trust me, if I had sent you to them, they would have totally understood you."
Ezekiel,3,7,"But the Israelites ain't gonna listen to you, 'cause they don't listen to me either. They're all stubborn and closed-minded. Like, seriously, they've got hard foreheads and hard hearts."
Ezekiel,3,8,"Yo, I've equipped you with an unbeatable confidence to face anyone head-on without flinching."
Ezekiel,3,9,"I've made you as strong as a stubborn rock, with a fierce attitude. Don't sweat those haters or get freaked out by their stares, even if they're a bunch of rebels."
Ezekiel,3,10,"And then he was like, yo, listen up, dude. Take all the stuff I'm about to tell you and really get it in your heart, you know? Open up your ears and fully hear what I'm saying."
Ezekiel,3,11,"Yo, go and find those who are locked up, the peeps from your own crew, and reach out to them. Talk to them and let 'em know what's up, cos this is straight from the Lord GOD—whether they wanna listen up or ignore it, that's on them."
Ezekiel,3,12,"And then, like, I was totally lifted up by this amazing spiritual vibe, and like, I heard this voice from behind me that was, like, super intense. It was all, 'Yo, the glory of the LORD be totally blessed from wherever He is at, ya know?'"
Ezekiel,3,13,"Yo, I totally heard the epic sound of those living creatures' wings bumping into each other, and the wheels making a sick noise right next to them, like a super intense rush!"
Ezekiel,3,14,"Alright, listen up - something crazy happened. Suddenly, I felt this intense energy lifting me up, taking me away. Let me tell you, I was beyond frustrated, full of fiery anger, but man, the power of the LORD was totally overwhelming me. You can't even imagine!"
Ezekiel,3,15,"So, I went to the TikTok fam in Telabib, who were chilling by the river of Chebar. I sat down right where they were sitting and spent a whole week being totally mind-blown with them."
Ezekiel,3,16,"So, after like a whole week, the LORD hit me up with a message, you know what He said?"
Ezekiel,3,17,"Yo, bro, listen up! I've chosen you to be like a lookout for the peeps of Israel. So, pay attention to what I gotta say and give 'em a heads up from me!"
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I tell those who are being wicked, 'You're definitely gonna meet your end,' and you don't bother to give them a heads up or warn them about their wicked ways to help save their lives, that wicked person is gonna die because of their own evil. But I'm gonna hold you accountable for not saying something."
Ezekiel,3,19,"But like, if you call out someone who's doing wrong and they don't change their ways, they'll suffer the consequences for their actions. But hey, at least you did your part and saved yourself from any guilt."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Yo, listen up. If a righteous person decides to ditch their righteous ways and starts doing messed up stuff, and I put obstacles in their path, they're gonna pay the price. See, you didn't even try to warn them, so they're gonna die with all their sins weighing them down. And hey, all the good they've done in the past? It won't even matter. But guess what? I'm gonna hold you accountable for their blood on your hands, bro. Just saying."
Ezekiel,3,21,"But hey, here's the deal: if you give a heads up to someone who's already doing the right thing, making sure they don't mess up, and they actually don't mess up, they'll keep on living their best life. You know why? Because you helped them out! And bonus, you saved yourself too."
Ezekiel,3,22,"Then God's power was upon me, and he said to me, 'Get up, go out into the open area, and I'll talk with you there.'"
Ezekiel,3,23,"So, I got up and headed out into the open space, and BAM, God's amazing presence was right there, just like how I saw His incredible glory by the river of Chebar. And man, I couldn't help but bow down with my face on the ground."
Ezekiel,3,24,"And suddenly, a mood came over me. It lifted me up and started chatting with me, telling me to go and lock myself in my crib."
Ezekiel,3,25,"Yo, dude, listen up! You, as a son of man, gotta pay attention 'cause they gonna slap those handcuffs on you, tie you up real tight, and keep you from stepping out into their territory."
Ezekiel,3,26,"And I'm gonna make your mouth stick to the roof, so you won't be able to speak and school those rebellious peeps. They don't want no advice from you, fam."
Ezekiel,3,27,"Yo, when I'm talking to you, I'll make it so you can speak your mind, and you gotta tell 'em like this, Godd says this: If someone's listening, they better really listen, and if someone's not into it, they can just back off. 'Cause those peeps are straight up rebellious."
Ezekiel,4,1,"Yo, dude! As for you, son of man, grab a tile and place it in front of you. Then, get artsy and paint the city, yep, that Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,4,2,"Like, surround the place, build a sick fortress, and put up big ramps. Set up the whole crew around it and bring in some heavy artillery. They're like the boss leaders or something!"
Ezekiel,4,3,"Yo, grab an iron pan and use it like a solid wall between you and the city. Face it head-on and start a siege against it. This is gonna be a sign for the house of Israel. Just sayin'!"
Ezekiel,4,4,"Just chill on your left side and take on all the bad stuff that the people of Israel have done. You gotta do this for as many days as you lie on your side, and that's how you'll carry their wrongdoings."
Ezekiel,4,5,"I'm gonna make you carry the weight of their wrongdoing for a long time, exactly 390 days. You'll be responsible for the sins of the people of Israel, like a massive burden on your shoulders."
Ezekiel,4,6,"And once you've finished doing that, lie on your right side again. You'll take on the consequences of the wrongdoing of the house of Judah for forty days. Each day represents a year. It's like a day standing for a whole year."
Ezekiel,4,7,"So, like, you gotta like, totally focus on, like, the whole situation with Jerusalem and stuff. And you gotta like, bare your arm or whatever, and speak out against it, you know?"
Ezekiel,4,8,"Yo, check this out: I'm gonna restrict your movement, like putting bands on you, so you can't even flip over until you've survived the entire duration of being under siege. (By the way, 'from one side to another' means you can't twist or turn around.)"
Ezekiel,4,9,"Yo, grab some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Mix 'em all up in one container and make some bread out of it. You gotta eat this bread for 390 days, while you're chilling on your side. No cheating!"
Ezekiel,4,10,"And the food you'll eat will be carefully portioned, like twenty shekels a day, not more. Stick to the plan and eat it at regular intervals."
Ezekiel,4,11,"You gotta stick to a specific water ration, like only a sixth of a hin. Make sure to hydrate regularly too!"
Ezekiel,4,12,"And you should eat it like barley cakes, and bake it using manure in front of them."
Ezekiel,4,13,"God was like, 'Yo, listen up. The Israelites gotta eat their messed up food while they're living among the non-Israelite people that I'll be sending them to.'"
Ezekiel,4,14,"I was like, 'Yo, Lord GOD!' Listen up, my soul has not been defiled. Since I was young till now, I've never eaten any dead or torn-up animals, and I haven't put any nasty, disgusting meat in my mouth."
Ezekiel,4,15,"And he's like, yo, I hooked you up with cow's dung instead of human dung, so you can use it to bake your bread, man!"
Ezekiel,4,16,"Yo, he was like, 'Listen up, dude. Imma mess up the whole bread situation in Jerusalem. They gonna eat bread but in limited portions and with stress. And when they drink water, it's gonna be all measured out and they gonna be shook.'"
Ezekiel,4,17,"So, like, they're gonna be all, like, craving for bread and water, and they'll be, like, super shocked and amazed by what's happening, and, you know, they'll just suffer the consequences of their bad choices and stuff, like, totally."
Ezekiel,5,1,"Yo, dude, check it out. Grab yourself a sick sharp knife, a barber's razor, and go ahead and shave off all that hair on your head and your beard. And once you're done, bust out those scales and weigh that hair, then divide it up evenly."
Ezekiel,5,2,"Yo, like, you gotta roast a third of the city with fire once the siege days are over, ya know? Then take another third, hit it up with a knife or something. And the final third, just straight up scatter it in the wind, dude. And watch out, 'cause I'm gonna chase after them with a sword, no joke."
Ezekiel,5,3,"You gotta grab just a few, then tuck 'em away safely in your fit. {fit: Hebrew translation for wings}"
Ezekiel,5,4,"Then, like, take them and throw them back into the fire, and, you know, burn them up in the fire. 'Cause, like, a fire will come out from there and spread throughout the whole house of Israel, okay?"
Ezekiel,5,5,"Yo, listen up! God is like, 'Check it, homies! This is what the boss, the Lord GOD, has to say: Jerusalem is where it's at! I've put it right in the middle of all these other nations and countries!'"
Ezekiel,5,6,"And she totally twisted up my rules, even worse than other countries, and my laws more than neighboring nations. They straight up rejected my rules and laws and didn't bother following them."
Ezekiel,5,7,"So, like, this is what the Lord GOD has to say: 'Yo, because you went and multiplied way more than all the other nations around you and totally didn't follow my rules or keep my commandments, or even do what the other surrounding nations are doing;'"
Ezekiel,5,8,"So this is what the big man upstairs says: Yo, I'm totally not feeling you right now and I'm about to drop some serious judgments smack in the middle of your turf for everyone to see."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And I'm gonna pull off something crazy with you that I've never done before, and I won't do it again because of all the messed up stuff you're doing."
Ezekiel,5,10,"So, like, the dads will start munching on their own sons, and the sons will take a bite out of their dads too. And I'm gonna bring down some serious punishments on you, and everyone left will get scattered in all directions, man!"
Ezekiel,5,11,"Yo, listen up! As the Lord GOD lives, let me tell you straight up: since you've messed up my sacred place with all your disgusting stuff and abominations, I'm gonna bring you down a notch. I won't hold back, won't show any mercy."
Ezekiel,5,12,"Like, okay, so basically, like, one third of the people are gonna be taken out by this super intense sickness, and another third will basically starve because, like, no food, right in the middle of everything. And, like, an additional third will, like, totally get taken out by, you know, like, violence all around. Oh, and I'm gonna, like, totally scatter the last third in, like, all directions, and, you know, send a sword after them or something."
Ezekiel,5,13,"So, like, when I'm totally done being angry, I'm gonna unleash all my rage on them. And honestly, I'll find some comfort in that. They'll learn that it was me, the LORD, who said it because of how passionate I am. Once I've done letting out all my fury on them, they'll know for sure."
Ezekiel,5,14,"And I'm gonna make you totally irrelevant and a total embarrassment among the other countries around you, in front of everyone who happens to be passing by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"This is gonna be so embarrassing and shocking for all the nearby nations when I unleash my anger and furious punishment on you. I, the LORD, am warning you."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I hit them with those hunger arrows, it's gonna be a disaster for them. Those arrows are gonna mess them up real bad, and I'm sending them to obliterate you too. I'll make the famine even worse for you, and I'll take away your source of food."
Ezekiel,5,17,"I'll make sure you go through tough times with hunger and scary creatures, leaving you empty-handed. There will be diseases spreading and violence everywhere, and I'm bringing the fight to you. This is the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,1,"So, like, I'm just chilling, right? And then the big man upstairs slides into my DMs and drops a message like,"
Ezekiel,6,2,"Yo, dude, listen up! Look towards those epic mountains of Israel and start speaking some truth about them."
Ezekiel,6,3,"Listen up, fam! This is a message from the Lord GOD to all you mountains of Israel. He's straight up saying that he's gonna unleash some serious devastation on you, like bringing a sword and crushing your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,Your altars will be empty and your images will be smashed: I will bring down those who have been killed before your idols.
Ezekiel,6,5,"And I'll totally flex by exposing the lifeless bodies of the homies from Israel right in front of their idols. Plus, I'm going to scatter your bones all around those fancy altars and stuff. No cap. 💀 {flex: Hebrew word for show off}"
Ezekiel,6,6,"All your cities are gonna get wrecked and the cool hangout spots will become ghost towns. That's so there won't be any altars left, and your idols will get destroyed and forgotten. They're gonna take down all your fancy statues, and everything you've worked on will be totally wiped out."
Ezekiel,6,7,"And when people start dropping, you'll know that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,8,"But don't worry, I'll make sure a few of you survive and escape the violence in other countries when you get scattered."
Ezekiel,6,9,"Those who survive will remember me no matter where they end up, because their hearts have turned away from me and they chase after their idols. They will feel disgusted with themselves for the horrible things they have done and all their sinful actions."
Ezekiel,6,10,"And they'll totally get that I'm the LORD, and like, I wasn't just saying for no reason that I was gonna bring this evil upon them."
Ezekiel,6,11,"Listen up, fam! The Lord is like, 'Yo, hit with your hand, stomp with your foot, and be like, 'Dang, all the messed up stuff goin' on in the house of Israel!' 'Cause they gonna get wrecked by sword, hunger, and disease.'"
Ezekiel,6,12,"Those who are far away will be doomed by sickness, and those who are close will be destroyed by violence. Even those who remain and are trapped will perish due to starvation. This is my way of unleashing my anger upon them."
Ezekiel,6,13,"And that's when you'll realize that I'm the LORD, when their dead bodies are scattered around their idols, everywhere from the hilltops to the mountains to the trees. It's in those places where they used to offer up sacrifices and worship their false gods."
Ezekiel,6,14,"I'm gonna totally wreck them and make the land completely deserted, like even more deserted than the middle of nowhere. They'll have nowhere to live! And then they'll finally realize that I'm the ultimate boss, the LORD."
Ezekiel,7,1,"So like, God hit me up and was all like,"
Ezekiel,7,2,"Yo, son of man, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel: It's over, the end has arrived for every nook and cranny of the land."
Ezekiel,7,3,"Yo, it's game over for you. I'm about to unleash my anger and pass judgment on you based on your actions. You're gonna get what you deserve for all the messed up stuff you've been doing."
Ezekiel,7,4,"And I won't hold back, I won't show any mercy. I'll pay you back for what you've done, and your disgusting actions will be right in front of you. Then you'll finally realize that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,7,5,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD says, like, something really bad is about to go down, I'm telling you!"
Ezekiel,7,6,"OMG, it's happening! The end is here, like for real. It's totally coming for you, like, seriously! Like, look, it's actually happening, no joke. #AwakeAgainst"
Ezekiel,7,7,"Yo, wake up! For those of you chillin' in this land, it's time to face the facts. The clock is ticking, and we're about to dive headfirst into some serious chaos – no turning back. No more peaceful mountain echoes."
Ezekiel,7,8,"I'm about to unleash my anger on you real soon, and I'm gonna let you have it for all the messed up stuff you've been doing. I'll totally call you out on your actions and make sure you get what you deserve for all your disgusting behavior."
Ezekiel,7,9,"And I won't hold back or have any sympathy, I will give you what you deserve based on your actions and wickedness that is among you. And you will realize that I am the LORD who punishes."
Ezekiel,7,10,"Yo, check it out, the day has arrived, like for real: the morning is up and goin'; things are blossoming, and pride is sprouting."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Like, there's been so much violence going on, it's seriously out of control. It's like this wickedness has become a weapon, you know? And let me tell you, none of those people who are causing all this chaos are gonna get away with it. No one from their crew, no one from their squad, nobody! And honestly, nobody's even gonna shed a tear for them. It's gonna be radio silence, man."
Ezekiel,7,12,"Yo, it's go time, the day is gettin' closer: don't let the buyer flex, nor the seller be bummed: 'cause straight up, wrath is comin' for everyone involved."
Ezekiel,7,13,"Once something is sold, the seller can't change their mind, even if they're still alive. This vision is about the entire group of people, and it won't be reversed. No one can rely on their wrongdoing to make themselves stronger in life."
Ezekiel,7,14,"They've posted about it, trying to hype everyone up; but no one actually steps up to fight: 'cause I'm mad at all of them."
Ezekiel,7,15,"There's danger everywhere, yo. Sword fights, sickness, and hunger on the loose, both in the open and indoors. The folks out in the field? They gonna get wiped out by the sword. And those in the city? They're gonna get straight devoured by famine and disease, no doubt."
Ezekiel,7,16,"But those who manage to get away, they'll be up in the mountains like valley doves, all of them feeling down, each one reflecting on their wrongdoings."
Ezekiel,7,17,"Everyone's hands will be weak, and everyone's knees will be as wobbly as water. Like, super weak, you know?"
Ezekiel,7,18,They'll like totally wear sackcloth and be hella scared; their faces will be all ashamed and everyone will have bald heads.
Ezekiel,7,19,"They will throw their money in the streets, and their wealth will fade away. Their riches will not be able to save them when the LORD's anger comes upon them. They will not find satisfaction or fulfillment, both physically and emotionally, because their sinful behavior is causing them to stumble."
Ezekiel,7,20,"When it comes to how awesome his decoration was, it was total royalty. But they went and made these utterly disgusting and repulsive images instead. So, because of that, I made sure to keep my distance from all of it. Yep, considered it totally gross and impure."
Ezekiel,7,21,"I'm totally gonna let these random outsiders snatch it up, and those wicked people on the earth are gonna have a field day with it, straight up trashing it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"I'll totally ignore them and they'll totally ruin my sacred spot. Yeah, those burglars will totally break in and totally mess it up. (BTW, burglars means robbers!)"
Ezekiel,7,23,"Yo, gather 'round: 'cause this place is a total mess, filled with all sorts of messed up stuff happening all over, and the city is just rife with violence, man."
Ezekiel,7,24,"So I'mma bring in the most wretched of the non-believers, and they gonna take over their homes. I'll also shut down all the fancy stuff that the powerful have, and their sacred spots gonna be totally messed up. Ya know, like inherited."
Ezekiel,7,25,"Total chaos is on its way, and people will desperately search for peace, but it won't be found. (Chaos: It's like everything's falling apart)"
Ezekiel,7,26,"One problem after another, and gossip on top of gossip; then they'll desperately seek guidance from influencers; but the religious leaders will ignore their responsibilities, and the wise elders will offer no counsel."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king will be sad 😔, and the prince will feel all empty inside, and the people of the land will be all stressed out. I'm gonna treat them just like they treated others, and I'll judge them based on what they deserve. Then, they'll finally realize that I'm the LORD. Yeah, you heard it right! 💁‍♂️"
Ezekiel,8,1,"So, like, in the sixth year, on the sixth month, on the fifth day, while I was just chilling at my crib, and the older peeps from Judah were hanging out with me, suddenly, I felt the power of the Lord GOD come upon me."
Ezekiel,8,2,"So, like, I looked and saw this crazy vision of fire! It was like fire coming from his waist down, and even his waist up was all bright and had this amber color. Totally mind-blowing, dude!"
Ezekiel,8,3,"Then he like, appeared with a hand and grabbed a lock of my curly-haired head, and I totally got lifted up in spirit between the earth and the sky, getting this epic vision from God. It was like, whoa, and I found myself in Jerusalem at the door of the inner gate facing north. And guess what? There was this idol that made people super jealous just chillin' there."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And, like, whoa, the totally epic glory of God, the big boss of Israel, was totally there, just as I saw it in this mind-blowing vision, out in the open."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Yo, bro, this dude came up to me and said, 'Hey, man, look north!' So I checked it out and, bro, I saw this messed up image by the altar entrance. It was like, some super jealous vibe going on."
Ezekiel,8,6,"And then he said to me, dude, check out what's going on here. The people of Israel are doing some seriously messed up stuff in my holy place. It's making me want to peace out, man. But wait, there's more messed up stuff coming your way."
Ezekiel,8,7,"So like, he takes me to the entrance of the court and when I check it out, boom! There's this legit hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"So, like, he's all, 'yo dude, go ahead and dig in the wall, son of man' and I'm there digging in the wall like legit, and bam! There's a freaking door, man."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And he was like, 'Yo, come with me and peep the messed up stuff they're doing here, bro.'"
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in and checked it out, and bro, you won't believe what I saw. There were all these creepy crawlers, nasty creatures, and like, all these idols from the house of Israel, painted on the walls all around."
Ezekiel,8,11,"So, like, there were these seventy cool dudes from the OG Israel crew. And right in the middle, Jaazaniah, son of Shaphan, was there, holding it down with his censer in hand. And yo, a thick cloud of dope incense went straight up, creating those chill vibes."
Ezekiel,8,12,"So, like, this guy comes up to me, right? He's all like, 'Hey, dude! Have you peeped what those old-school peeps from Israel are up to in secret? Ya know, each and every one of 'em, locked in their own little fantasy worlds?' And get this, they're actually saying, 'Um, hello? God can't see us, bro! God totally ditched the earth!'"
Ezekiel,8,13,"He was like, 'Yo, turn around again and check out the even more messed up stuff that they're doing.'"
Ezekiel,8,14,"So he takes me to the entrance of the LORD's crib, exactly on the north side. And guess what? There were these girls sitting there, totally bawling their eyes out for Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"Yo, bro, check this out! So, dude said to me, 'Yo, have you peeped this, son of man? Turn around and brace yourself, 'cause you're about to witness some even crazier messed up stuff than what you've seen so far.'"
Ezekiel,8,16,"So, he took me to the super exclusive part of the LORD's house, and guess what? Right at the entrance of the temple, between the cool porch and the fancy altar, there were like twenty-five dudes facing away from the temple and towards the east, totally idolizing the sun."
Ezekiel,8,17,"Yo, listen up, dude. Did you peep this, bro? It's not just a small deal for the people of Judah to be doing all these messed up things, you know? They're straight up filling the whole land with violence and straight up ticking me off. Seriously, they're even doing weird stuff like putting branches up to their noses. Like, seriously, you think that's lighter than anything else they've done?"
Ezekiel,8,18,"So, I'm gonna go all out with my anger. I won't hold back or show any mercy. Even if they scream and shout at me, I won't pay them any attention."
Ezekiel,9,1,"He like, shouted super loud in my ears, yo, and was all like, 'Yo, bring those dudes in charge of the city closer, like, everyone should come armed and ready to destroy, man!'"
Ezekiel,9,2,"Yo, check it out, six dudes rolled up at the north gate strapped with weapons, ready for some action. And one of them was rocking a fresh linen outfit with a writer's inkhorn by his side. They went inside and stood by the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"And the lit vibes of the God of Israel was like, yeeted up from the cherub, where he was chillin', and went all the way to the entrance of the house. Then he hollered at the dude rockin' the fresh linen clothes, who was totally sportin' a sick writer's inkhorn on his hip."
Ezekiel,9,4,"And God said to him, Yo, go through the city, like right in the heart of Jerusalem, and put a special symbol on the foreheads of those dudes who are, like, super bummed out and upset about all the messed up stuff happening there. You know, all the really messed up things people are doing. That's what I'm talking about. So yeah, mark 'em up, you know what I mean? The mark, mark, mark."
Ezekiel,9,5,"And then he said aloud for me to hear, go follow him through the city and attack without hesitation: don't hold back or have any mercy. {Heb. mine ears: it means he was speaking directly to me}"
Ezekiel,9,6,"Take down everyone, regardless of age or gender: girls, boys, women. But don't touch anyone who has the mark, and start with my holy place. They started with the elderly men standing in front of the house."
Ezekiel,9,7,"He told them, Mess up the house and spread out the bodies in the streets: go ahead. So they went out and killed people in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"So, like, it happened that while they were like, killing everyone else, I was like the only one left. I was so shook that I just fell on my face and started crying out to God, like, 'OMG Lord GOD! Are you seriously gonna wipe out all the remaining people of Israel and unleash your wrath on Jerusalem?'"
Ezekiel,9,9,"So he told me, the wrongdoings of the people of Israel and Judah are like, really really bad, and the whole land is filled with violence, and the city is full of corruption. They keep saying that God has abandoned the earth, and God doesn't care about what's happening."
Ezekiel,9,10,"And as for me, I won't hold back or show mercy. I'll make sure they get what they deserve."
Ezekiel,9,11,"Yo, check it out! There was this dude rockin' some fresh linen threads, and he had an inkhorn on fleek by his side. He came through and was like, 'Listen up, fam! I've carried out your commands, just as you asked.'"
Ezekiel,10,1,"So I was lookin', right? And I saw somethin' amazing up in the sky above the cherubims. It looked like a super fancy sapphire stone, kinda like a throne's vibe."
Ezekiel,10,2,"So, like, God talked to this dude in fancy clothes and was all like, 'Yo, go stand in between those like, wheels or whatever, right under that angel statue thing. Grab some burning coals from between the other angel statues and like, throw them all over the city.' And the guy did it while I was watching."
Ezekiel,10,3,"So like, there were these angel dudes chilling on the right side of the house, you know, just minding their own business, while this dude walked in. And suddenly, this epic cloud rolled in and completely filled up the inner court. It was wild."
Ezekiel,10,4,"And suddenly, the LORD's awesomeness lifted off from the cherub and hovered right above the entrance of the crib. The whole crib was filled with this epic cloud, and the entire courtyard was shining super bright with the LORD's incredible glory. Like, it was next level."
Ezekiel,10,5,"And you could hear the cherubims' wings flapping all the way to the big courtyard, sounding like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks."
Ezekiel,10,6,"So, like, the guy in fancy clothes gets this command to grab fire from between the wheels, you know, the ones near the cherubims. And then he goes in and stands next to the wheels."
Ezekiel,10,7,"And one of the cherubs reached out their hand from between the other cherubs towards the fire that was in the middle, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the person dressed in linen. They took it and went away."
Ezekiel,10,8,"And, like, there was this super cool thing that happened with the cherubims. It was like a hand, but, like, a hand that looked like a dude's hand, you know? And it was, like, peeking out from under their wings. Totally mind-blowing!"
Ezekiel,10,9,"And like, when I checked it out, I saw these four cool wheels chillin' next to the cherubs. Each wheel was hangin' with one of the cherubs, and they totally looked like beryl stones, you know, super shiny and stuff."
Ezekiel,10,10,"And like, these four dudes all looked the same, it was like they were a wheel within a wheel, you know?"
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they moved, they moved in all directions without changing their course. They didn't veer off track, but instead, they stayed in line with the direction their heads were facing. They remained steadfast and didn't deviate from their path."
Ezekiel,10,12,"Bro, these angelic beings were decked out with eyes all over their bodies, backs, hands, wings, and even their wheels, man. And yo, those wheels had eyes too, all around. It was a whole sight to behold!"
Ezekiel,10,13,"So, like, there was this voice calling out to the wheels and I heard it, saying, 'Yo, wheel!'"
Ezekiel,10,14,"And each one had four faces: the first face was like a cherub, the second face was like a human, the third face was like a lion, and the fourth face was like an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubims flexed up. This is the dope creature that I peeped by the river of Chebar.
Ezekiel,10,16,"So, like, the cherubims were like rolling with the wheels, you know? And when the cherubims decided to fly up, their wings all up in the air and stuff, the wheels stayed right there with them. No turning away or anything. Totally synced, dude!"
Ezekiel,10,17,"When they stood, these creatures stood; and when they were lifted up, these creatures lifted up themselves too: because the spirit of the living creature was within them. (of life)"
Ezekiel,10,18,"And then the epicness of the LORD bounced from the entrance of the house and like, hovered over the awesome cherubims, ya know?"
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the cherubims spread their wings and flew up from the ground right before my eyes. As they went out, the wheels were right there with them, and each one stood at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD's house. The amazing glory of the God of Israel was shining over them from above."
Ezekiel,10,20,"Yo, check it out, this is the epic spiritual being that I peeped chillin' with the God of Israel by the Chebar River. And I totally recognized that they were the cherubims."
Ezekiel,10,21,"Each of them had four faces and four wings, and they looked like a human's hands were beneath their wings."
Ezekiel,10,22,And their faces looked just like the ones I saw by the river of Chebar. They had the same looks and they all moved straight ahead.
Ezekiel,11,1,"Then I was like, suddenly taken to the east gate of the LORD's house, facing the east. And I saw like, 25 dudes standing there at the gate, including Jaazaniah, Azur's son, and Pelatiah, Benaiah's son, who were like, important leaders among the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"And he said to me, bro, peep this: these dudes right here, they be plotting all sorts of trouble and spitting pure evil advice in this city:"
Ezekiel,11,3,"They're like, 'Nah, it's not even close yet. Let's just build some rad houses instead. This city is where all the action is happening, and we're the cool kids in the mix.'"
Ezekiel,11,4,"So like, go ahead and speak out against them, speak up, bro."
Ezekiel,11,5,"And then the LORD's vibe just hit me, and He was like, 'Yo, speak up! This is what the LORD has to say: I know exactly what's going on in your heads, fam, every single thought.'"
Ezekiel,11,6,"Y'all be causin' mad deaths up in this city, straight fillin' the streets with bodies."
Ezekiel,11,7,"So, like, God is saying this: The people you killed and left in the city, they're like the meat in a cooking pot. But don't worry, I'm gonna rescue all of you from this messed up city."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You guys have been freaking out about the sword, so guess what? I'm gonna bring a sword your way, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,9,"And I'll totally get you out of there, and hand you over to some random people, and I'll totally judge you there."
Ezekiel,11,10,"You'll totally get wrecked by some swords; when I bring judgment to your turf in Israel, you'll finally realize that I'm the one and only LORD."
Ezekiel,11,11,"This place ain't gonna be your hangout spot, and you won't be the popular crowd around here; instead, I'll bring down some judgments on you at the outskirts of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,12,"And you'll realize that I'm the LORD because you haven't followed my rules or made fair decisions, but instead, you've copied the behavior of those non-believers around you. (It's like you haven't followed the rules at all!)"
Ezekiel,11,13,"So, like, when I was prophesying, this dude named Pelatiah, Benaiah's son, straight up died. Bro, I totally fell to the ground, face-planted, and started bawling my eyes out like, 'Oh my gosh, Lord GOD! Are you seriously gonna wipe out the remaining peeps of Israel?'"
Ezekiel,11,14,"So, the LORD hit me up with another message, like,"
Ezekiel,11,15,"Yo, listen up, son of man. Your peeps, your fellow peeps, the dudes from your fam, and all the squad of Israel, they're the ones that the people of Jerusalem are dissing. They're like, 'Get outta here, go away from the LORD. This land is for us, it's our turf'."
Ezekiel,11,16,"So like, God says, even though I've, like, sent them far away to live among different people and, you know, scattered them in different places, I'll still be there, like a chill little safe space for them in those countries they end up in."
Ezekiel,11,17,"So, like, listen up! God is saying, 'I'll totally bring you all together from different places, gathering you up from the countries where you've been scattered, and hook you up with the land of Israel.'"
Ezekiel,11,18,"And, like, they'll go there and totally remove all the disgusting stuff and all the things that are, like, super gross from that place."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I'm gonna change things up, ya know? Like, I'll give 'em this one heart that's totally brand new and fresh. Plus, I'll remove that cold, hard heart they got goin' on and replace it with a heart that's soft and full of feels."
Ezekiel,11,20,"So, like, if they follow my rules and do what I told them to, they'll totally be my crew and I'll have their backs, you know what I mean?"
Ezekiel,11,21,"But for those who are obsessed with disgusting things and despicable actions, I will make them face the consequences of their own choices, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,22,"And the cherubims were like, yo, let's spread our wings and the wheels beside them were like, rolling along. And the glory of the God of Israel was like, totally above them, you know."
Ezekiel,11,23,"Yo, the LORD's glory straight up bounced from the city and pulled up on the mountain on the east side, like a boss."
Ezekiel,11,24,"Then the spirit lifted me up and brought me in a super epic vision by the Spirit of God to Chaldea, where the captives were. That's when the rad vision I had totally vanished."
Ezekiel,11,25,"So, I told them all about the captivity and everything the LORD had shown me."
Ezekiel,12,1,"So, like, the LORD hit me up with a message, right?"
Ezekiel,12,2,"Yo, bro, check it. You livin' in a place full of rebels. They got these eyes, but they don't even use 'em to really see, ya feel? And they got ears, but they ain't listenin'. These rebels, man, they pushin' back against the flow."
Ezekiel,12,3,"Yo dude, listen up! As a fellow human, get yourself ready to pack all your things and start moving during daylight where everyone can see. You gotta relocate from your current spot to another spot right in front of them. Maybe, just maybe, they'll actually think about it, even though they're a bunch of rebellious peeps. Note: 'stuff' could also mean 'instruments', ya know?"
Ezekiel,12,4,"Then you will publicly pack up your belongings during the day, as if preparing to move, and you will leave in the evening, as if joining others who are being taken into captivity."
Ezekiel,12,5,"Yo, straight up, dig a hole in front of their eyes and get your stuff out through it. #DigLife #StealthMode"
Ezekiel,12,6,"You gotta show off by carrying it on your shoulders in front of everyone. Do it at dusk and make sure to cover your face so you don't see the ground. This is gonna be a sign to the Israelites, you know?"
Ezekiel,12,7,"So like, I totally followed the instructions I was given, you know? During the day, I packed up my things like I was getting ready for a trip or something, but secretly, when it got dark, I dug through the wall with my own hands. Then, under the cover of twilight, I carried all my stuff on my shoulder right in front of them. It was pretty slick, right? #ninja"
Ezekiel,12,8,"And the next morning, the LORD hit me up with a message, like,"
Ezekiel,12,9,"Yo, dude, haven't the peeps of Israel - you know, the ones always rebelling - been asking you, like, 'What's your deal, man?'"
Ezekiel,12,10,"Yo, tell them this is what the Lord GOD is sayin': This message is all about the prince in Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel who's chillin' with 'em."
Ezekiel,12,11,"Yo, listen up! I'm here to give you a heads up: just like I did my thing, the same thing is gonna happen to them. They're gonna get taken away and put into captivity. It's gonna be a major change for them. Yeah, you heard me right, they're gonna be locked up!"
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the cool prince in the gang will shoulder the responsibility in the late hours, and make moves: they'll break through the wall to escape: he'll hide his face, so he won't be caught by the opps."
Ezekiel,12,13,"I'm gonna trap him with my net, snag him real good. Then I'll bring him all the way to Babylon, where the Chaldeans live. But guess what? He won't even get to see it, 'cause that's where he's gonna bite the dust."
Ezekiel,12,14,"And I'll totally scatter all his squad who had his back in every direction, plus all his homies; and I'm gonna chase 'em down with my sword."
Ezekiel,12,15,"And they gonna be like, 'Yo, God in the house, no doubt!' when I go and spread them out all over the world, you know, in different countries and stuff."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But like, I'll let some of them survive all the chaos and stuff, you know? So they can like spread the word about all the messed up stuff they're doing to the other nations they go to. And when that happens, they'll totally realize that I am, like, the LORD and stuff. Yeah, it's crazy cool."
Ezekiel,12,17,"And then, God hit me up and was like,"
Ezekiel,12,18,"Yo dude, when you grab a bite to eat, do it with total intensity, and when you gulp down a drink, do it with mad caution and being fully aware."
Ezekiel,12,19,"And tell the people this, the Lord God of Jerusalem and Israel says: They will eat their food anxiously and drink their water in amazement, so that the land may become desolate because of the violence of those who live there. It will be stripped bare of everything it contains."
Ezekiel,12,20,"And like, all the cities that are poppin' will be totally wrecked, and the land will be deserted; and y'all gonna straight up realize that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,12,21,"So, like, the LORD totally dropped me a message, and it went like,"
Ezekiel,12,22,"Yo, dude, check this out: God's sayin', 'Hey, son of man, what's up with that saying y'all got goin' on in Israel? Y'know, the one where y'all say that the days are draggin' on and all the visions are turnin' out to be bogus?'"
Ezekiel,12,23,"So listen up, this is what the Lord GOD has to say: I'm gonna put an end to this saying of yours, and it won't be a thing in Israel anymore. Instead, I want you to tell them that the days are right around the corner, and every vision will come true."
Ezekiel,12,24,"In the crib of the fam of Israel, no more fake visions or sweet-talkin' fortune tellin'."
Ezekiel,12,25,"Yo, I'm the LORD: When I say something, it's gonna happen, no delays or extensions. In your time, oh rebellious crew, I'll speak and make it happen, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,12,26,"Yo, the LORD hit me up again, like,"
Ezekiel,12,27,"Yo, dude! Check it, the people of Israel are saying that this vision the dude is seeing is gonna take forever to happen. They think he's talking about some far-off future times or something."
Ezekiel,12,28,"So like, here's the deal, folks. God's like, 'Listen up, y'all. My words won't be dragged on anymore. What I've spoken will totally go down. For real, says the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel,13,1,"So, like, God hit me up and was like,"
Ezekiel,13,2,"Yo dude, listen up! This message is for all those self-proclaimed prophets in Israel who think they can predict the future. I've got something to say to you from the big man upstairs. Pay attention and hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,13,3,"Listen up, fam! The Lord GOD has a message for all those clueless prophets who are just following their own vibe without seeing anything. They be walking after their own desires and fronting like they've seen things they didn't."
Ezekiel,13,4,"Yo, Israel, your prophets be out here movin' like foxes in the deserts."
Ezekiel,13,5,Y'all haven't filled in the gaps or built a solid defense for the house of Israel to stand strong in the battle on the day of the LORD.
Ezekiel,13,6,"Yo, these people be out here spreading fake news, clout-chasing like they got a direct line to God, but ain't nobody sent them. And worst of all, they're giving false hope to others, making them believe their words are legit."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Yo, have y'all not peeped a bogus vision and spoken some fake divination, claiming it's from the LORD when He never said a word?"
Ezekiel,13,8,"So like, God's saying, 'Yo listen up! You've been spouting nonsense and falling for fake stuff, so guess what? I'm totally not on your side,' says God."
Ezekiel,13,9,"And I'm gonna call out those fake prophets who just spout nonsense and speak lies. They won't be part of my squad, won't be remembered in the history of Israel, and won't even step foot in the land of Israel. And you're gonna see that I am the Lord GOD, no doubt."
Ezekiel,13,10,"Like, dude, these people straight up deceived my peeps by saying, 'Everything's chill, no worries,' but yo, there was absolutely no chill. They built this weak wall and then others haphazardly slapped on some cheap-ass material to make it look legit, but let me tell you, it's anything but solid."
Ezekiel,13,11,"Tell those who use weak {material} to cover it, that it will collapse: there will be a heavy rainstorm; and you, oh massive hailstones, will fall; and a powerful wind will tear it apart."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Yo, once that wall crumbles, won't they be like, 'Yo, where's that dope paint job y'all did?'"
Ezekiel,13,13,"So, like, God's saying, I'm gonna totally tear it up with, like, a super intense storm wind 'cause I'm super mad. And there's gonna be, like, a crazy heavy rain shower when I'm all angry and huge hailstones to totally wipe it out."
Ezekiel,13,14,"I'm gonna wreck that wall you tried to fix up with some weak mortar. It's gonna crumble to the ground, exposing its weak foundation. It'll totally collapse, and you'll be destroyed along with it. And guess what? You'll finally realize that I'm the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,15,"So, I'm gonna totally unleash my anger on that wall, and on the people who sloppily patched it up with bad material. And I'll straight up tell you, the wall is gonna crumble, along with the ones who patched it up."
Ezekiel,13,16,"So, like, here's the deal: the prophets in Israel are all about predicting good vibes for Jerusalem. They're all about those peaceful visions, you know? But listen up, it's not all rainbows and butterflies, says the Lord GOD. No peace, fam."
Ezekiel,13,17,"Hey bro, as a fellow human, focus on exposing those girls from your community who are giving their own made-up prophecies. You gotta speak out against them too."
Ezekiel,13,18,"Yo, listen up, the Lord GOD has a message: I gotta warn you, it's not looking good for those {ladies} who sew comfy pillows onto all their sleeves, and make fancy headbands for everyone, just to manipulate and trap people's souls. Seriously, are you out here trying to steal and save souls that come to you? What's up with that? {sleeves: or, elbows}"
Ezekiel,13,19,"Are you seriously trying to disrespect me in front of my people just for a measly handful of barley and bits of bread, all while mercilessly killing innocent souls and protecting the lives of those who deserve punishment? And on top of that, you have the audacity to deceive those who trust you with your fake stories? Seriously, can you not see the damage you're causing to my people with your deceitful lies?"
Ezekiel,13,20,"So listen up, says the Lord GOD. Check it, I'm not cool with your pillows that you use to lure innocent souls away. I'm gonna snatch them right outta your grip and set those souls free, the ones you're trying to snatch up."
Ezekiel,13,21,"I'm gonna shred those fancy kerchiefs of yours and set my peeps free from your grip. You won't have them as targets anymore, and that's how you'll know I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,22,"You totally messed with the emotions of the righteous peeps by spreading lies, which I definitely did not approve of. And you also gave a major boost to the wicked ones, persuading them to stick to their evil ways by falsely promising them a good life. (Just so you know, I ain't about to save them or anything!)"
Ezekiel,13,23,"So, like, you won't see any more pointless stuff or hear any more bogus predictions, 'cause I'm gonna rescue my people from your control. And then you'll know, without a doubt, that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,14,1,"So, like, these older dudes from Israel came to me and took a seat in front of me."
Ezekiel,14,2,"So, like, the LORD totally reached out to me and was like,"
Ezekiel,14,3,"Yo, bro, check it out. These dudes be straight up worshipin' their idols and keepin' their sinful ways front and center. Like, seriously! Can they really expect me to answer their prayers and stuff?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"So like, go talk to them and be like, 'Yo, here's what the Lord GOD says: Any dude from the house of Israel who's all about their idols and lets their sins mess 'em up, but still comes to the prophet - I, the LORD, will answer them in a way that matches all the idols they're all obsessed with."
Ezekiel,14,5,"So that I can connect with the house of Israel on a personal level, because they've all drifted apart from me by chasing after their idols."
Ezekiel,14,6,"So, listen up, fam! This is a message straight from the OG, the Lord GOD Himself. It's time to do a total 180, turn away from your idol obsessions, and ditch all the messed up stuff you've been doing. No more wasting time on that toxic nonsense, okay?"
Ezekiel,14,7,"If anyone from the Israel fam or a visitor in Israel decides to distance themselves from me and starts worshipping idols in their mind and flaunts their sinful ways, and then goes to a prophet to ask about me, I, the LORD, will personally give them a response:"
Ezekiel,14,8,"And I'm gonna be totally done with that guy, like seriously, he's gonna be a total joke and everyone's gonna use him as an example of what not to do. I won't even consider him as one of my people anymore. And trust me, you'll all see that I'm the LORD, no doubt."
Ezekiel,14,9,"And if the prophet gets it wrong when they say something, I, the LORD, have allowed that prophet to be deceived. I'm gonna take action against them and wipe them out from among my people, Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,And they will face the consequences of their wrongdoing: the prophet will be punished just like the one who comes looking for him;
Ezekiel,14,11,"So that the fam of Israel won't drift away from me anymore, or get messed up with all their wrongdoings; but instead, they'll be my peeps, and I'll be their supreme ruler, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,14,12,"God hit me up again, like, 'yo, listen...'"
Ezekiel,14,13,"Yo, listen up, son of man. When the land straight up disrespects me and seriously crosses the line, I'm gonna take action, no doubt. I'll stretch out my hand and totally mess up the food supply, bringing on some intense hunger. Trust me, both humans and animals won't be spared from this consequence."
Ezekiel,14,14,"Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were all in the same situation, they would only be able to save themselves through their own righteousness, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,14,15,"If I bring in weird animals who wreck the place and make it a total mess, so that it becomes deserted and nobody can pass through because of these creatures."
Ezekiel,14,16,"No cap, these three dudes ain't gonna save anyone, swear to God, says the Lord GOD. They'll only save themselves, but the land gonna be straight up deserted. (in it: Like, right in the middle of it)"
Ezekiel,14,17,"And if I bring out a sword and say, 'Yo, sword, do your thing and swipe through the land, wiping out all humans and animals,'"
Ezekiel,14,18,"Yo, like, as the Lord GOD lives, I'm telling you, these three dudes ain't gonna save nobody else, only themselves gonna be saved, no sons or daughters, I swear."
Ezekiel,14,19,"Or, like, if I unleash a super scary disease in that place and totally lose it, causing like a crazy amount of violence, wiping out both people and animals:"
Ezekiel,14,20,"Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were hanging out in that situation, swear to God, they wouldn't be able to save their kids. They could only save themselves by being righteous."
Ezekiel,14,21,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD says, imagine when I hit up Jerusalem with my four heavy punishments: sword, famine, messed up creatures, and diseases, wiping out both humans and animals. It's no joke!"
Ezekiel,14,22,"But check it out, there's gonna be a small group left, like, a remnant, made up of guys and girls. They're gonna come out and you'll see how they live and what they do. And trust me, when you see all the bad stuff I did to Jerusalem, you'll find comfort in knowing it was for a reason."
Ezekiel,14,23,"And they'll totally understand you, like, once you witness their actions and behavior: then you'll realize that everything I've done in it has a legit reason, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,15,1,"So, like, God totally messaged me and was all like,"
Ezekiel,15,2,"Yo, dude, like, why is the vine tree so much better than any other tree, or even a branch in the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,"Why would anyone use that wood for anything useful? Can't imagine someone trying to hang a vase on a tiny peg from it, lol."
Ezekiel,15,4,"Yo, check it out, this thing gets thrown into the fire to be used as fuel. The fire straight-up engulfs both ends, and the middle part gets burned. Can it even be useful for anything? Like, will it actually work out?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Yo, listen up! This thing used to be useful, but now it's all burned up. Like, seriously, it's not even remotely fit for any work anymore. The fire totally wrecked it, bro!"
Ezekiel,15,6,"So God says this: Imagine a vine tree in a forest, right? And just like that tree is used as fuel for fire, I'm gonna do the same with the peeps in Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,15,7,"And I'll be totally done with them, like no more good vibes coming their way. They'll try to escape one hot mess but just end up in an even hotter mess. Then they'll realize that I'm the real deal, the LORD, when I totally turn against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,"So like, I'm totally gonna leave the land all empty and stuff, because they straight up messed up and crossed the line, says the Lord GOD. {committed...: Heb. trespassed a trespass}"
Ezekiel,16,1,"Yo, God hit me up again, saying,"
Ezekiel,16,2,"Yo, dude, go and make sure Jerusalem is fully aware of all the messed up things she's doing."
Ezekiel,16,3,"And like, listen up, the Lord God is talkin' to Jerusalem, saying: Dude, your roots go way back to Canaan, your hometown. Your pops was an Amorite, and your mom was a Hittite. (Note: Canaan is slang for your homeland, and roots refer to your ancestry.)"
Ezekiel,16,4,"And when you were born, you weren't bothered with all that fancy stuff like cutting your umbilical cord or getting cleaned up with water. You weren't even given a sprinkle of salt or wrapped up in those cozy blankets. It was just you, plain and simple."
Ezekiel,16,5,"No one showed you any love, compassion, or sympathy. You were abandoned in the middle of nowhere and left to despise yourself from the day you came into this world."
Ezekiel,16,6,"And like, when I like, totally passed by you and saw you, like, all messed up in your own blood, I was like, yo, when you were in that bloody state, I was like, live, dude; yeah, I totally said to you, when you were all covered in blood, live. (polluted: or, like, trampled on)"
Ezekiel,16,7,"You've grown like a wildflower in the field, flourishing and thriving. You've become adorned with beautiful jewelry, your figure developed, and your hair grown, covering what was once bare. You've been transformed from nothing to something truly incredible."
Ezekiel,16,8,"So, like, when I saw you, I was totally feeling the love vibes, you know? I was all about protecting you and like covering up your vulnerable parts. Swear on it, I made a promise to you and we became tight, says the Lord GOD, like you were totally mine."
Ezekiel,16,9,"So I cleansed you with water, like totally washed away all your blood, and I like anointed you with oil. {blood: like Hebrew bloods}"
Ezekiel,16,10,"I dressed you up in fancy clothes, put cool shoes on you made of badgers' skin, wrapped you in high-quality linen, and covered you with silk."
Ezekiel,16,11,"I totally flexed on you with some sick bling, decking you out with mad accessories like dope bracelets on your hands and a sick chain around your neck."
Ezekiel,16,12,"I adorned you with a sick jewel on your forehead, dope earrings in your ears, and a mad beautiful crown on your head. (forehead: in Hebrew it's nose)"
Ezekiel,16,13,"So you were all blinged out with gold and silver; your clothes were on point with fine linen, silk, and fancy embroidery. You were eating that high-quality grain, honey, and olive oil. And girl, you were straight-up gorgeous and thriving, turning into a legit kingdom."
Ezekiel,16,14,"Yo, your beauty was so on fleek that even the non-believers couldn't resist talking about it. You were looking so flawless because I, the Lord GOD, decked you out with my own swag."
Ezekiel,16,15,"But like, you relied on your looks and started being promiscuous because you were so well-known, and like, you hooked up with anyone who walked by; they were all into you."
Ezekiel,16,16,"You took your clothes and used them to decorate your elevated spots in various flashy colors, and you engaged in promiscuous behavior there. Those kind of things won't happen again, and it won't be the same."
Ezekiel,16,17,"So you took the cool jewelry I gave you, made yourself statues that look like people, and started hooking up with them."
Ezekiel,16,18,"So you grabbed your fancy clothes and draped them over those things, then you proudly displayed my exclusive perfume and incense in front of them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"I hooked you up with some top-notch food, like prime cuts, fancy flour, gourmet oil, and sweet honey. And what do you do? You go and serve it up to others, making it all smell and taste amazing. That's how it went down, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,20,"And you've even taken your own children, whom you've given birth to for me, and have sacrificed them to be consumed by false idols. Is this not enough evidence of your immoral actions, that you find it insignificant to indulge in such sins?"
Ezekiel,16,21,"Wait, did you really kill my kids and offer them up as sacrifices? Seriously?"
Ezekiel,16,22,"And I can't believe all the messed up things you've been doing, like seriously, have you forgotten how carefree and wild you used to be when you were young? You were totally reckless and got yourself into some pretty awful situations."
Ezekiel,16,23,"And just so you know, after all the messed up things you've done, (yeah, you're in big trouble, says the Lord GOD;)"
Ezekiel,16,24,"You went and built yourself a fancy joint, setting up high spots in every street. (And by high spots, I mean sketchy spots where people get up to no good.)"
Ezekiel,16,25,"You're out here flexin' and showin' off at every corner, makin' people straight-up disgusted with your self-centeredness. And you're just spreadin' your legs for anyone who comes your way, gettin' all up in that promiscuous lifestyle of yours."
Ezekiel,16,26,"You've totally messed up by hooking up with those Egyptians, your neighbors who are all about that physical pleasure. And on top of that, you've been getting even more promiscuous, which really ticks me off."
Ezekiel,16,27,"Listen up, I totally flexed on you by messing with your vibes and made your basic stash of snacks disappear. I let you fall under the control of the squad that can't stand you, the Philistine girls who think you're way too scandalous. PS: they're also embarrassed by how you act."
Ezekiel,16,28,"You've been messing around with the Assyrians too, because you could never get enough; yeah, you've been acting like a player with them, but you still couldn't find satisfaction."
Ezekiel,16,29,"Like, seriously, you've totally taken your promiscuity to a whole new level, from Canaan all the way to Chaldea. And, like, you still can't seem to get enough of it."
Ezekiel,16,30,"Bruh, your heart is straight up weak, says the Lord GOD, considering you out here doing all these things like some arrogant and promiscuous chick."
Ezekiel,16,31,"Yo, you've been setting up shop at every corner and claiming prime real estate. You haven't been like those players who sell out for some quick cash. (Or should I say, 'In thy daughters is thine, etc')."
Ezekiel,16,32,"Like, imagine a wife who cheats on her husband and like, hooks up with random people instead of being faithful!"
Ezekiel,16,33,"They give gifts to all those who engage in promiscuity, but you give your gifts to all your lovers and bribe them, so they will come to you from all directions for your acts of promiscuity."
Ezekiel,16,34,"You're totally different from other girls when it comes to your promiscuity. No one wants to join you in your promiscuous adventures. Plus, you're giving out goodies, but no one is giving you anything in return. That's why you're just so opposite."
Ezekiel,16,35,"Yo, listen up, you promiscuous one! God's got something to say:"
Ezekiel,16,36,"Listen up fam, this is what the Lord GOD has to say: Your dirty deeds were all out in the open, your secrets exposed because of your scandalous relationships and your worship of disgusting idols. And let's not forget the wicked act of sacrificing your own children to them."
Ezekiel,16,37,"Listen up, I'm about to round up all your crushes and everyone you've ever liked or disliked. I'll gather them all around you, and I'll expose your deepest secrets to them, letting them see your true self."
Ezekiel,16,38,"Dude, I'm totally gonna bring down judgment on you like how people judge girls who cheat on their partners and harm others. And trust me, I'm gonna get real angry and jealous, and you're gonna feel my wrath like blood flowing. #judgment #fury #jealousy"
Ezekiel,16,39,"And I'll let them have power over you too! They'll totally wreck your awesome hangout spots, and destroy those places you think are so high and mighty. Not only that, they'll totally embarrass you by taking your cool clothes and snatching all your fancy jewelry, leaving you totally exposed and vulnerable. (Yeah, those jewelry pieces you love so much!)"
Ezekiel,16,40,"They'll come at you in a group, throwing mad shade and straight up ending you with brutal roasts and savage clapbacks."
Ezekiel,16,41,"And they're gonna like, totally set your houses on fire and pass judgments on you in front of a bunch of girls. And I'm gonna make you stop being promiscuous and you won't be able to make money from it anymore either."
Ezekiel,16,42,"I'll chill out on my anger towards you, and my envy will bounce. I'll be on the low, without any more rage."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Yo, you forgot how it was back in the day when you were young and now you're constantly stressing me out with all this nonsense. Well, guess what? I'm gonna make you pay for all the stuff you've done. The Almighty Lord says so. And on top of all the messed up things you've been doing, don't even think about getting involved in any more disgusting stuff."
Ezekiel,16,44,"Listen up, anyone who loves their catchphrases will hit you with this one, saying, 'Like mother, like daughter.'"
Ezekiel,16,45,"You're literally your mom's kid who can't stand her husband or her own siblings. And just so you know, your sisters are no different. They can't stand their husbands or kids either. Oh, and by the way, your mom is an Hittite and your dad is an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"Your older sis, Samaria, and her crew live on your left. Your younger sis, Sodom, and her girls live on your right. Your sis on the right is not as big as you are."
Ezekiel,16,47,"But yo, you haven't been following their trends or participating in their messed up stuff. But check it, even though it may seem small, you've actually gone down a darker path than them in every way."
Ezekiel,16,48,"I swear on my life, says the Lord GOD, Sodom and her crew didn't even come close to the messed up stuff that you and your squad pulled off."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Yo, listen up! Let me break it down for you. The deal with your sister Sodom was that they were all about pride, having way too much food, and being lazy AF. They didn't bother to help out the poor and the needy, which was not cool."
Ezekiel,16,50,"And they were acting all high and mighty, doing some messed up stuff in front of me, so I decided to give them the boot, just like that."
Ezekiel,16,51,"Samaria didn't even commit half the sins you did; you've totally taken it to the extreme with your disgusting actions. And on top of that, you've made your sisters seem innocent compared to you, even though you've done just as much messed up stuff as them."
Ezekiel,16,52,"Yo, you who be judgin' yo' sisters, own up to yo' shame for them sins you be committin' that be even more messed up than theirs. They be more righteous than you, like straight up. Yeah, you be all embarrassed and carry yo' shame, 'cause you been justifying yo' sisters and that's not cool."
Ezekiel,16,53,"When I finally free those who were taken captive, including the people of Sodom and Samaria, I will also bring back those who were captured from your midst."
Ezekiel,16,54,"So you'll have to deal with the embarrassment and feel ashamed for everything you've done, because you're just boosting their ego."
Ezekiel,16,55,"When your squad, Sodom and her squad, get back to their old vibe, and Samaria and her squad get back to their old vibe, then you and your squad will get back to your old vibe too. #Goals"
Ezekiel,16,56,"Back in the day when you thought you were the coolest, you never even talked about Sodom, your sister. Like, it never even came up in your conversations, ya know?"
Ezekiel,16,57,"Back when your dirt was exposed and people were throwing shade on you, including the girls from Syria and all the nearby Philistine girls who were straight up clowning on you."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You've totally taken on your wickedness and disgusting actions, says the LORD. Like, seriously, you've fully embraced them."
Ezekiel,16,59,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD is saying: I'm gonna treat you the same way you treated me. You straight up disrespected the oath and broke the covenant. Not cool, dude."
Ezekiel,16,60,"But don't stress, I got your back since forever. We made a deal during your teenage days and I'm gonna make it last for eternity."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Once you realize what you've done and feel embarrassed, you'll receive your sisters - both the older and younger ones. I'll accept them as your daughters, but not under the conditions you had previously agreed upon."
Ezekiel,16,62,"And I'll make a totally legit promise with you, so you'll know that I'm the LORD, like, for real."
Ezekiel,16,63,"So you remember and just totally cringe, like never ever speak again because you're so ashamed, when I forgive you for everything you've done, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,17,1,"So, like, God totally hit me up and was like,"
Ezekiel,17,2,"Yo, dude, listen up! I've got a sick brain teaser for you. Check it - I'm gonna drop some truth in the form of a story for the peeps of Israel."
Ezekiel,17,3,"And God said, listen up! There was this totally dope eagle, with massive wings and loads of feathers. It was like the OG with a bunch of different colors. This eagle flew all the way to Lebanon and landed on the tallest branch of a cedar tree."
Ezekiel,17,4,He cut off the coolest part of his new branches and took it to a trendy city; he put it in a place full of entrepreneurs.
Ezekiel,17,5,He also found some cool seeds and planted them in a super fertile field. He put them next to a big water source and grew them into a tall and strong willow tree.
Ezekiel,17,6,"And it grew, like, super fast, and it was like this short vine that, you know, leaned towards its main dude. Its roots were all underneath it, you know, holding it down. So it became a full-on vine, with branches popping out and new sprigs shooting up."
Ezekiel,17,7,"Yo, there was another super dope eagle, with mad huge wings and like, so many feathers, you feel me? And check it, this vine totally flexed by curling its roots towards that eagle, and it straight up extended its branches towards it, so that the eagle could water it through like, the furrows of its planting zone."
Ezekiel,17,8,"The vine was planted in an epic spot near some dope water, so it could grow mad branches and produce some lit fruit. It was meant to be a hella good vine, you know? Like, the best of the best. {field: Hebrew for 'field'}"
Ezekiel,17,9,"Listen up, this is what the Lord GOD is saying: Will it succeed? Won't He just uproot it, cut off its fruit, and make it wither away? It will wither, even without a massive force or a bunch of people to pull it up by its roots."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Yo, listen up! Picture this: if a plant is put in the ground, is it gonna thrive? Nah, it's gonna dry out completely when the east wind blows on it. It's gonna wither away in the very same place where it started growing."
Ezekiel,17,11,"So, like, the LORD totally hit me up and was all like,"
Ezekiel,17,12,"Yo, to all you rebellious peeps out there, don't you even have a clue what's going on? Check it, the king of Babylon has arrived in Jerusalem and snatched up the king and the princes, taking them back to Babylon with him."
Ezekiel,17,13,"And has taken some of the king's fam, made a pact with him, and got him to swear an oath. He's also brought in all the powerful peeps in the land."
Ezekiel,17,14,"So the kingdom stays grounded and doesn't get too full of itself, because its foundation lies in faithfully upholding the covenant."
Ezekiel,17,15,But he straight up betrayed him by sending his squad to Egypt to get horses and a whole crew. Is he seriously gonna come out on top? Will he just bounce back after pulling that kind of stunt? Or is he gonna totally break the deal and face the consequences?
Ezekiel,17,16,"I swear, says the Lord GOD, for real, in the spot where the king lives, the same king who disrespected the oath he made and broke the covenant, right there in the middle of Babylon he's gonna meet his end."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Yo, Pharaoh and his whole army won't be able to get at him in war, even if they try to build up superior defenses and cunningly trap many people."
Ezekiel,17,18,"Like, seriously, he totally dissed that promise when he straight up broke the agreement, man. I mean, he even shook hands and went and did all that stuff. Well, guess what? There's no way he's gonna get away with it."
Ezekiel,17,19,"So this is what the Lord GOD says: Oh, I swear by my life, he totally dissed my promise and straight up broke our agreement. Well, guess what? I'm gonna make sure he gets what he deserves. It's gonna hit him right in the head!"
Ezekiel,17,20,"Yo, I'm gonna trap him like a pro with my dope net and drag him to Babylon. I'll straight up confront him there for all the messed up things he did against me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"And all his crew and followers will be taken out by the sword, and those who are left will be scattered everywhere: then you'll realize that I, the LORD, said it."
Ezekiel,17,22,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD is saying: I'm gonna take the dopest branch from the tallest cedar tree and place it on an epic high mountain. I'll cut off a fresh and tender twig from the very top and plant it there, like a boss!"
Ezekiel,17,23,"I'm gonna plant this really awesome tree on a super tall mountain in Israel. It's gonna grow some sick branches, bear fruit, and be a stunning cedar. All kinds of birds with fancy wings will chill out under it and live in the shade of its branches."
Ezekiel,17,24,"And like, all the trees in the field will totally know that I, the LORD, totally brought down the high tree, gave a major boost to the low tree, dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree thrive: I, the LORD, have spoken and made it happen, no cap."
Ezekiel,18,1,"Yo, God hit me up again, and he was like,"
Ezekiel,18,2,"Yo, why are you all saying this phrase about the land of Israel like 'the parents ate sour grapes, so now the kids' teeth are messed up'? What's your point?"
Ezekiel,18,3,"I swear, says the big man upstairs, you won't be throwing around that saying in Israel ever again."
Ezekiel,18,4,"Yo, listen up! Just so you know, I'm in charge of all souls - no exceptions! Whether you're a father or a son, your soul belongs to me. But here's the deal: if a soul sins, it's gonna perish, no doubt about it."
Ezekiel,18,5,"But yo, if a dude be legit and chooses to do what's right and fair, you know, like making wise choices and acting with integrity, that's what it's all about. It's all about bringing about good judgment and justice, you feel me?"
Ezekiel,18,6,"And hasn't indulged in food on high places, nor obsessed with household idols. Hasn't messed with someone else's spouse, hasn't even gotten close to a girl on her period."
Ezekiel,18,7,"And hasn't been unfair to anyone, but has returned what was owed to those in debt, hasn't taken advantage of others forcefully, has shared food with those who were hungry, and has given clothing to those without."
Ezekiel,18,8,"Someone who doesn't lend money with interest, and doesn't try to make a profit, who stays away from doing bad stuff, and makes fair decisions in disagreements between people,"
Ezekiel,18,9,"They've been following my rules and being fair, being a just person. They'll keep on living for sure, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,18,10,"If a dude has a son who's all into robbing and causing bloodshed, you know, doing tough stuff like that, robbing houses and whatnot, being all shady to his bro, well, that's not cool."
Ezekiel,18,11,"And someone who doesn't do any of those things, but instead chills on the hills and disrespects their neighbor's spouse,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"This person has been crushing the poor and those in need, taking their stuff forcefully, not giving back what they owe, and showing devotion to false idols. They've done some really messed up things."
Ezekiel,18,13,"If someone lends money and charges interest, and then makes even more money from it, can they really live a good life? No way! The person who does this evil stuff deserves to die. They have committed so many horrible acts, and their blood will be on their own hands."
Ezekiel,18,14,"Check it, imagine if the old man has a kid who peeps all the messed up stuff he's done, thinks about it, and decides not to follow in his footsteps."
Ezekiel,18,15,"If someone hasn't chowed down on mountain-top grub, or checked out those trendy idols the Israelites are into, or dipped their toes in the scandalous waters of their neighbor's relationships,"
Ezekiel,18,16,"They haven't hurt anyone, they haven't kept anything as collateral, they haven't taken things by force. Instead, they've shared their food with the hungry and given clothes to those who need them. They haven't taken advantage of others or withheld anything they owed."
Ezekiel,18,17,"If someone's decent enough to help the poor without expecting anything in return, and they follow my rules, they won't pay for their ancestor's mistakes - they'll keep on living."
Ezekiel,18,18,"Regarding his dad, he was a total bully who messed with his brother and did messed up things to his people. So, guess what? He's gonna get what's coming to him and face the consequences of his actions."
Ezekiel,18,19,"But hold up, here's the deal: Why should the son be held accountable for the sins of his dad? If the son does what's right and follows all my rules, he'll definitely thrive and live his best life."
Ezekiel,18,20,"If you do wrong, you gotta face the consequences. The child isn't responsible for the parent's mistakes, and vice versa. Those who do good will be rewarded, and those who do bad will face the consequences."
Ezekiel,18,21,"But if someone who's been doing wrong can change and stop committing sins, and follow all my rules, and do what's fair and just, they'll definitely live and won't die."
Ezekiel,18,22,All the mistakes he's made won't be brought up: he'll be recognized for the good things he's done and be able to prosper.
Ezekiel,18,23,"Do I even like it when the wicked peeps die? Nope, says the Lord GOD. I'd rather they change their ways and start living, ya know?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"But like, when a righteous person ditches their righteousness and starts doing shady stuff, copying all the messed up things that wicked people do, can they really stay alive? All the good they've done in the past won't even matter anymore. It's all about the mistakes they've made and the sins they've committed—those are the things that will bring them down."
Ezekiel,18,25,"But you're like, 'God's way is not fair.' Listen up, fam of Israel! Isn't my way legit fair? Are your ways not jacked up?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a good person ditches their righteousness and starts doing bad stuff, and then dies while still being bad, they'll totally pay the consequences for all the bad stuff they did. So yeah, they'll die because of all that bad stuff."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Like, when a person who's been doing mean and wicked stuff decides to make a change and starts doing what's right and respecting others, they'll totally save their soul, you know?"
Ezekiel,18,28,"Dude, if he actually reflects on all the messed up stuff he's done and makes a complete 180, he's gonna get his act together and live his best life, no doubt about it. No death sentence for him."
Ezekiel,18,29,"But the house of Israel complains, saying, 'God's path isn't fair.' Oh, house of Israel, aren't my ways fair? Are your ways not unfair?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"So, listen up fam, the Lord GOD is about to pass judgment on you, the house of Israel. He's gonna judge each one of y'all based on your own actions, no cap. It's time to change your ways, repent, and ditch all your wrongdoings. That way, you won't be wrecked by all your sins. Trust."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Get rid of all the bad stuff you've been doing and start fresh with a new mindset and a whole new vibe. Seriously, why are you choosing to mess things up, fam? Israel, you gotta level up or you'll end up ruining everything."
Ezekiel,18,32,"Yo, just so you know, I'm not into celebrating when someone dies, says the LORD GOD. So, why don't you change your ways and start living your best life? Trust me, it's worth it. #YOLO"
Ezekiel,19,1,"Also, compose a sad tribute for the cool kids of Israel,"
Ezekiel,19,2,"And like, think about it, who's your mom really? A total badass lioness, chilling with the lions, raising her cubs in the midst of these fierce young lions. That's how epic she is, bro."
Ezekiel,19,3,"So she raised one of her little ones: it grew into a fierce lion, and it honed its hunting skills; it feasted on people."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The other countries were like, dude, they caught him and threw him in their trap, and then they dragged him to Egypt all chained up."
Ezekiel,19,5,"So, when she realized she had waited for a long time and her hope was gone, she decided to choose one of her cubs and raised it to be a fierce young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"So he totally flexed and balled with the lions, turned into a fierce young lion, and straight up mastered the art of hunting and feasting on humans."
Ezekiel,19,7,"And he totally wrecked their fancy mansions and destroyed their cities. The land became a complete ghost town because of the deafening sound of his furious rampage. {their desolate...: or, their widows} {the fulness...: or, all it containeth}"
Ezekiel,19,8,"So, like, all these nations came at him from all angles, you know, surrounding him from different parts, and trapped him in their sneaky plan. And bam, they finally caught him in their little trap."
Ezekiel,19,9,"So they locked him up with chains and took him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into confinement, silencing his voice from being heard on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Yo, your mom's like a vine up in your veins, planted by the waters. She was hella fruitful and had mad branches 'cause of all that water. #blessed"
Ezekiel,19,11,"And she had these totally powerful sceptres for the rulers, and her vibe was all like, super high up among the thick branches, and she was totally slaying with her many branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But then something went down - she got completely wrecked, thrown to the ground, and this crazy east wind totally dried up all her fruit. Like, her strong branches got snapped and dried out, and the fire straight-up burned them to ashes."
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she's stuck in the middle of nowhere, in, like, a total desert with no water or anything."
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire has consumed the branches of the rod, causing all the fruit to be destroyed. Now she has no mighty rod to rule as a scepter. This is a song of sorrow, and it will be heard as a song of sorrow."
Ezekiel,20,1,"So, like, in the seventh year, on the fifth month and the tenth day, a bunch of important elders from Israel like totally came to ask the LORD some questions. And they sat right in front of me, dude."
Ezekiel,20,2,"And then God hit me up, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,3,"Yo, dude, listen up! I got a message from the Lord GOD for all you elders of Israel. He says, 'Are you seriously coming to ask me something? As the Almighty lives, I won't be answering your questions.'"
Ezekiel,20,4,"Yo, son of man, you gonna judge them? Let 'em know about the messed up stuff their fathers did."
Ezekiel,20,5,"Yo, listen up! Here's what the Lord GOD says: Back in the day, when I picked Israel and made myself known to them in Egypt, I swore to be their God. I raised my hand to show I meant business, you know? So, remember, I'm the real deal, the LORD your God."
Ezekiel,20,6,"Back when I promised them and swore that I'd lead them out of Egypt to a dope land I scoped out for them, yo, it's flowing with milk and honey, the illest place on earth."
Ezekiel,20,7,"And I was like, yo dudes, ditch all the nasty stuff you're into and don't even think about getting down with those Egyptian idols, okay? 'Cause I'm the LORD your God, no doubt about it."
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they straight up defied me, didn't listen to what I was saying, and refused to get rid of all the messed up stuff they were into. They didn't give up their obsession with idols and were still stuck on the Egyptian vibe. So I was like, 'Fine, I'm gonna unleash my anger on them and let them have it right there in Egypt.'"
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I did it to keep my rep clean, so that it wouldn't get trashed by all those non-believers. They were watching closely as I flexed on them by pulling my peeps out of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,"So, I like totally helped them leave Egypt and took them to the wilderness, you know?"
Ezekiel,20,11,"So, like, I totally gave them all these cool rules to live by, and made sure they knew how to make the right choices. And if they actually follow these rules, they'll enjoy a totally awesome life! Just saying, like it's pretty straightforward, ya know?"
Ezekiel,20,12,"I even hooked them up with my chill weekends, as a way to show we're tight and that I'm the one who keeps them blessed."
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the squad of Israel totally rebelled against me when we were out in the wild: they straight up ignored my rules and disrespected my decisions. You know, if they had followed them, it would've been all good and they would've really thrived; still, they totally trashed my sacred days. So I was like, I'm gonna let my anger loose on them right here in the wilderness and just wipe 'em out."
Ezekiel,20,14,"I did what I did to protect my reputation from being disrespected by those who don't believe, since they were watching when I set my people free."
Ezekiel,20,15,"But I promise, I made a solemn oath to them when we were out in the wild, that I wouldn't lead them to the amazing land I had already planned for them. It's seriously a super cool place, filled with delicious food and amazing blessings. It's like the coolest place ever!"
Ezekiel,20,16,"Because they totally dissed my rules and didn't vibe with my way of doing things. They straight up messed up my chill relaxation days, because deep down, they were more into their own obsessions."
Ezekiel,20,17,"But like, I decided not to totally wipe them out, even though they were acting all rebellious and stuff. And I definitely could have just left them stranded in the wilderness, but nah, I gave 'em another chance."
Ezekiel,20,18,"Yo, I was straight up telling their offspring in the wilderness, like don't follow your parents' rules, don't even bother with their decisions, and definitely don't mess with their idols and stuff."
Ezekiel,20,19,"I'm the LORD your God, so vibe with my rules, stay woke to my judgments, and actually follow through with them;"
Ezekiel,20,20,"And keep my sabbaths lit; they're like a dope vibe between me and you, so you know I'm your almighty God."
Ezekiel,20,21,"But yo, the kids straight up rebelled against me. They didn't follow my rules or do what I said, which, if you do, you'll totally thrive. They even messed up my chill resting days. So I was like, I'm gonna let my anger loose on them and teach them a lesson in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,22,"But like, I decided to chill and do my thing for the sake of my reputation, you know? Didn't wanna mess up my rep in front of those non-believers, 'cause they were watching when I brought my people outta there."
Ezekiel,20,23,I solemnly swore to them while we were in the wilderness that I would scatter them among different nations and spread them out across the lands.
Ezekiel,20,24,"So, like, they totally didn't follow my rules and dissed my laws, trashed my chill sabbaths, and were all obsessed with their ancestors' idols. SMH."
Ezekiel,20,25,"So, I decided to hand them some rules that weren't so great, you know, statutes and judgments that definitely wouldn't lead to a good life."
Ezekiel,20,26,"And I like, totally messed up their offerings, man, because they were sacrificing all the firstborns by passing them through the fire. It was like, so wrong, bro. I did it to show them how ruined they were, and to make them realize that I'm the LORD, you know?"
Ezekiel,20,27,"Yo, dude, listen up. God's got a message for the people of Israel. He wants me to tell them that their ancestors totally disrespected Him by crossing the line and doing something they shouldn't have done. It's not cool, man."
Ezekiel,20,28,"So, when I finally brought them to the land that I promised them, they couldn't help but notice all the awesome tall hills and lush trees. And you know what they did? They went ahead and offered their sacrifices there, provoking me with their actions. They even made things smell good with their sweet fragrances and poured out their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,"So, I was like, 'Hey guys, where are you heading off to that fancy spot?' And they were like, 'Oh, it's called Bamah, still called that today.'"
Ezekiel,20,30,"Yo, listen up, Israelites! The Lord GOD's got something to say. Are you following in the messed up footsteps of your ancestors? Are you getting down and dirty with their wicked ways?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"Yo, peeps! When you be presenting your gifts and making your sons go through the fire and worshipping idols, you're straight-up polluting yourselves, even till this day. And you wanna come to me, asking for stuff, O house of Israel? Listen up, I swear on my name, says the Lord GOD, I ain't entertainin' your requests."
Ezekiel,20,32,"And whatever pops into your head, don't even think about saying, 'We're gonna be like those non-believers, following their weird gods made of wood and stone.'"
Ezekiel,20,33,"I swear, says the Lord GOD, I'll totally dominate you with my power, strength, and intense anger."
Ezekiel,20,34,I'm gonna rescue you from all those places you got scattered to and gather you together with some serious power and anger.
Ezekiel,20,35,"I'm gonna take you to where it's all happening, and that's when I'll have a serious talk with you, straight up, no masks."
Ezekiel,20,36,"You know how I was all up in your ancestors' faces when they were chilling in the wilderness of Egypt? Well, I'm gonna do the same with you, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,37,"And I'll guide you through a chill challenge, bringing you into the tight bond of our covenant: deliverance you'll receive!"
Ezekiel,20,38,"And I'll like, totally kick out all the rebels and those who like, totally mess with me. They can't stay in the place where they're chilling, and they definitely won't get to enter Israel. And you'll like, totally know that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,39,"Listen up, fam! The Big Guy upstairs has a message for you, Israel fam. He's like, 'Alright, do your thing, worship your idols, I guess. But, remember, if you don't wanna listen to me, don't be disrespecting my holy name with your gifts and idols anymore, got it?!"
Ezekiel,20,40,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD says that on my holy mountain, the highest peak in Israel, all the house of Israel will serve me. Everyone, all the peeps in the land, will worship and honor me there. That's where I'll be pleased with your offerings, your firstfruits, and all the holy stuff you bring. And by the way, firstfruits also mean the chief stuff, just so you know."
Ezekiel,20,41,"I'm totally into you when I rescue you from everyone and round you up from all the places you've been scattered. I'm gonna make myself look good through you, in front of all those non-believers."
Ezekiel,20,42,"And you will realize that I am the LORD when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the place I promised to give to your ancestors."
Ezekiel,20,43,"And that's when you'll reflect on your choices and everything you've done wrong, how you've messed up. You'll feel disgusted with yourselves, realizing all the bad stuff you've done."
Ezekiel,20,44,"And you'll totally realize that I, like, totally am the LORD, when I've been doing all this epic stuff for my reputation, not because you guys were being totally sinful and corrupt and stuff, you know, house of Israel, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,45,"So, like, the LORD hit me up with a message, and He was all like,"
Ezekiel,20,46,"Yo, son of man, turn your gaze to the south and spit some truth towards the south. Start prophesying against the forest in the southern field."
Ezekiel,20,47,"Yo, listen up, southern forest! God's got a message for you. He's basically saying, 'Get ready, 'cause I'm about to light you up with a fire that'll burn up every single tree, green or dried out. This fire's gonna be so intense, nothing can put it out. And guess what? It's gonna scorch everyone's faces from the south all the way to the north!'"
Ezekiel,20,48,"And everyone will see that I, the LORD, started it: it won't be put out."
Ezekiel,20,49,"And I was like, 'Yo, Lord GOD!' People be saying, like, does he always speak in riddles and stuff?"
Ezekiel,21,1,"And God messaged me, like,"
Ezekiel,21,2,"Yo, dude, listen up! Focus on Jerusalem and speak up about the sacred spots there. Share your prophecy about the land of Israel, bro."
Ezekiel,21,3,"Yo, listen up, Israel! The Lord has a message for you. He's letting you know that He's coming for you, and He's gonna unsheathe His sword to separate the righteous from the wicked."
Ezekiel,21,4,"So, like, since I'm gonna, like, separate the good peeps from the not-so-great peeps, my sword is gonna come out and do its thang, slaying every living being from the south to the north. Just sayin'."
Ezekiel,21,5,"So, like, everyone should know that I, the LORD, totally whipped out my sword from its sheath, and it's not going back in, like, ever."
Ezekiel,21,6,"So, like, seriously dude, just let out a big sigh, feeling that heaviness in your gut, and let them see how real it is."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And when they ask you why you're sighing, you'll say, 'Because of the news that's coming, it's about to happen!' Everyone's gonna be terrified and their hearts will melt, their hands will go weak, their spirits will faint, and their knees will be as wobbly as water. Look, it's happening and it's gonna go down, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,21,8,"So, like, the LORD spoke to me again, and He was all like,"
Ezekiel,21,9,"Yo, dude, listen up and spread the word from the big guy up there. He says, 'Get ready for some serious action because a sharp-as-heck, polished sword is about to go down!'"
Ezekiel,21,10,"It's all sharpened and ready to cause a bloody mess; it's polished to shine bright. So, should we really be throwing a party? It disrespects my son's authority, just like it disrespects every other tree."
Ezekiel,21,11,"And he's like, made it all shiny and stuff, so it's ready to be used: this sword is super sharp, and it's all polished, ready to be handed over to the one who's gonna slay with it."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Yo, listen up, dude: you better cry and wail, 'cause bad stuff is comin' for my peeps, even the high and mighty among 'em. They'll be scared outta their minds, with swords causin' terror. So go ahead, smack your thigh in despair."
Ezekiel,21,13,"Yo, listen up! This is just a test, you know? Like, what if the sword disses the rod? But don't worry, says the Lord GOD, that's not gonna happen anymore, okay? Like, when the test is over, everything will be cool, don't sweat it!"
Ezekiel,21,14,"Yo, bro, listen up. Take heed, you, dude. Drop some major prophecy knowledge and clap them hands, yo. It's gonna get intense, like a double dose of sword action, three times over. This sword ain't playing, it's meant for the big shots, takin' 'em down in their personal turf. Yeah, you heard that right, straight into their private chambers. (Hands...: Hebrew translation: hand to hand)"
Ezekiel,21,15,"I've totally aimed my sword at all their entrances, causing their hearts to lose hope and their destruction to increase. Oh no! The sword is all shiny and ready for a massive slaughter. (It's like, super sharp and stuff.)"
Ezekiel,21,16,"Just go in whichever direction you want, to the right or to the left, wherever you feel like. It's all up to you!"
Ezekiel,21,17,"I'll clap my hands together and let my anger calm down. I, the LORD, have said it."
Ezekiel,21,18,"So, like, the LORD, you know, talked to me once more and was like,"
Ezekiel,21,19,"Yo, dude, listen up! So, you, as a human, I want you to find two paths for the sword of the King of Babylon. Like, they gotta come from the same place, ya know? And make sure to choose a really strategic spot like, right at the entrance to the city or something."
Ezekiel,21,20,Send a path for the sword to reach Rabbath of the Ammonites and Judah in fortified Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,21,21,"So, like, the king of Babylon was standing at this fork in the road, you know, where there were two paths. And he was all into this divination stuff, trying to figure out what to do. He made his arrows all shiny and stuff, and he looked at these weird images. Oh, and get this, he even checked out the liver. Like, who does that? So weird."
Ezekiel,21,22,"Next to him was the blueprint for Jerusalem, organizing squads, hyping up the crowd, unleashing battle cries, deploying battering rams to breach the gates, constructing ramps, and fortifying the stronghold."
Ezekiel,21,23,"And it's gonna be like some fake fortune-telling to those who've made promises, but watch out, because their wrongdoings will come back to haunt them."
Ezekiel,21,24,"So this is what the Lord GOD says: You guys have really made a name for yourselves with all your wrongdoing, showing off your sins for everyone to see in everything you do. Well, guess what? You're not going to get away with it. You'll be caught red-handed."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And you, like, totally disrespectful and wicked ruler of Israel, your time has come, when all the evil you've been doing will finally come to an end,"
Ezekiel,21,26,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD is like, 'Yo, take off that fancy diadem and crown, 'cause things are about to change, my friend! Let's give some love and props to those who are lowly and humble, and bring down those who think they're all high and mighty.'"
Ezekiel,21,27,"I'm gonna totally flip this, flip it, flip it and it'll be completely gone until the one who deserves it comes along. And when he does, I'll give it to him. Totally flipping it... like, seriously flipping it."
Ezekiel,21,28,"Yo, bro! Listen up, son of man. I gotta deliver a message from the Lord GOD about those Ammonites and their disrespect. Let 'em know: the sword is ready for action! It's all shiny and sharp, ready to bring devastation and destruction."
Ezekiel,21,29,"When people try to deceive you with worthless things and false predictions, leading you into the clutches of the wicked who are doomed to perish, their wickedness will eventually come to an end."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Should I put it back in its case? I'll pass judgment on you right where you were born, in your homeland."
Ezekiel,21,31,"And I'm gonna be super furious at you, like totally furious. I'll unleash some serious fire and wrath your way, and hand you over to some seriously savage and skilled destroyers. Like, these guys are no joke."
Ezekiel,21,32,"You're gonna be fuel for the fire, your blood's gonna flow everywhere, and people ain't gonna remember you anymore. 'Cause I, the LORD, said so."
Ezekiel,22,1,"So like, God dropped me a message, and this is what He said,"
Ezekiel,22,2,"Yo, bruh, you, as a human, gonna make some judgments on this messed up city? Yeah, you gotta straight up expose all the messed up stuff she's doing. (And by judgments, I mean, like, stand up for what's right and expose the truth)"
Ezekiel,22,3,"So basically, God's like, 'Listen up, y'all! This city is out here causing chaos and violence, like it just wants its own downfall. And on top of that, it's making a bunch of dumb idols that only bring shame upon itself.'"
Ezekiel,22,4,"You've messed up big time by shedding blood and worshiping idols you made yourself. Your time is running out, and I've made you a laughingstock among the nations."
Ezekiel,22,5,"People close to you and those far away will totally roast you, because you're like, infamous and constantly irritated. Like, seriously, infamous... like, your reputation is so tarnished, and, like, you're always so mad."
Ezekiel,22,6,"Look, the leaders of Israel, each one had the ability to spill blood in your midst. {ability: Hebrew equivalent of having power or influence}"
Ezekiel,22,7,"They totally disrespected their parents, treated strangers unfairly, and made life difficult for orphans and widows in your midst. (BTW, that deceit part? It's like extra oppression.)"
Ezekiel,22,8,You totally disrespected my sacred stuff and straight up ruined my chill weekends.
Ezekiel,22,9,"There are people among you who spread rumors to harm others, and they enjoy feasting on the mountains. They also engage in inappropriate behavior right in your midst."
Ezekiel,22,10,"They totally went and exposed their ancestors' embarrassing moments through you, and went ahead to shame the one who was supposed to be respected."
Ezekiel,22,11,"Someone hooked up with his neighbor's wife, another seriously disrespected his daughter-in-law, and yet another had inappropriate relations with his own half-sister. (Just to clarify, when we say 'someone' or 'another,' we mean everyone involved in these messed up situations.)"
Ezekiel,22,12,"You've been accepting bribes to spill blood, making money off interest and loans, selfishly taking advantage of your neighbors through extortion, and completely forgetting about me, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,22,13,"Yo, check it out! I just can't ignore the fact that you've been all about that shady money-making and the violence that's been happening around you."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Yo, can you handle this? Can you keep it together when I come at you? Trust me, I, the LORD, am straight up saying it and I'm gonna make it happen."
Ezekiel,22,15,"And I'm gonna like totally spread you guys out among the nations, and like scatter you all over the place and stuff. And I'm totally gonna clean up all your bad stuff and make you all fresh and clean again!"
Ezekiel,22,16,"You gotta embrace who you are in front of everyone, including those who don't believe. Then, you'll recognize that I'm the one in charge. By the way, don't let your identity get disrespected."
Ezekiel,22,17,"So God hit me up with a message, like,"
Ezekiel,22,18,"Yo, human child, the people of Israel have become worthless to me. They're like cheap metals - brass, tin, iron, and lead - all mixed together in a furnace. Basically, they're just the impurities of silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"So here's what the Lord God is saying: Yo, you all have become straight up useless, so check it out, I'm gonna bring all of you together right in the heart of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"Just like when people collect silver, brass, iron, lead, and tin to put into a furnace and heat it up to melt it all down, I'm gonna gather all of you in my anger and fury and leave you there to be melted. It's gonna be like a big meltdown, literally. Just like the original meaning of 'according to the gathering' in Hebrew."
Ezekiel,22,21,"Yeah, I'll gather you up and unleash my fiery anger on you, and you'll totally be like melted in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,22,22,"Imagine silver being melted in a furnace, well, that's exactly what's gonna happen to y'all. And trust me, you're gonna realize that it's me, the LORD, unleashing all my anger on you."
Ezekiel,22,23,"Yo, the LORD hit me up and said,"
Ezekiel,22,24,"Yo, man, tell her straight up - you're the land that hasn't been washed or blessed during the times of rage."
Ezekiel,22,25,"Yo, there's like this whole group of prophets up in there, totally schemin' together. They're all fierce AF, like hungry lions on the hunt. They've straight up gobbled up souls and snatched all the valuables and bling. And dang, they've left a bunch of widows in their wake."
Ezekiel,22,26,"Yo, these priests straight up disrespecting my law and treating my sacred stuff with no respect. They don't even distinguish between what's holy and what's not, or between what's clean and what's not. They out here ignoring and neglecting my sabbaths, making me look bad in the process."
Ezekiel,22,27,"The leaders there are acting like hungry wolves, eagerly preying on others, causing violence, and destroying lives all for their own selfish gain."
Ezekiel,22,28,"And those false prophets have painted an unrealistic picture for them, promoting worthless things and sharing deceptive messages, claiming that this is what the Lord GOD is saying, even though the LORD hasn't actually spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The folks out there have been straight up shady - robbing, mistreating the underprivileged, and making life hard for those in need. Yeah, they're even discriminating against the outsiders for no good reason. (Note: 'oppression' can also mean deceitful tactics and 'wrongfully' implies doing stuff they have no business doing.)"
Ezekiel,22,30,"So, like, I was looking for someone among them who could, you know, step up and take care of business, standing in the way to protect the land so it didn't get wrecked. But seriously, I couldn't find anyone. Total bummer."
Ezekiel,22,31,"So, I totally unleashed my anger on them and totally burned them up with my furious rage: I made sure they faced the consequences of their own choices, that's what the Lord GOD said."
Ezekiel,23,1,"Yo, God hit me up again with a message, ya feel me?"
Ezekiel,23,2,"Yo, dude, listen up! So there were these two girls, right? And get this, they had the same mom!"
Ezekiel,23,3,"And they got involved in some sketchy stuff in Egypt; they kept doing sketchy stuff when they were young: they let others get too close, and they messed with their innocence."
Ezekiel,23,4,"So these two ladies, Aholah and Aholibah, were like sisters to each other. They belonged to me and had children. Aholah, also known as Samaria, and Aholibah, also known as Jerusalem, were their names. Aholah means 'His tent' or tabernaclee' and Aholibah means 'My tabernacle in her'."
Ezekiel,23,5,"And Aholah was all about that fling life when she was with me; she totally fell for her boo thangs, those Assyrians living nearby,"
Ezekiel,23,6,"They were wearing stylish blue outfits, all of them attractive young men, riding cool horses like pros."
Ezekiel,23,7,So she hooked up with all these popular guys from Assyria and idolized them. She did some pretty messed up stuff with them and got all involved in their false idol worship. It was a real defiling situation.
Ezekiel,23,8,"She didn't give up her promiscuity that she picked up in Egypt. In her early days, she had relationships with multiple partners and they took advantage of her innocence, leaving her feeling used and exploited."
Ezekiel,23,9,"So I gave her up to her crushes, to the Assyrians whom she was obsessed with."
Ezekiel,23,10,"These people exposed her, taking away her children and killing her violently. She gained quite a reputation among women, because they carried out divine punishment on her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she went way overboard with her love for all the wrong things, even more than her sister. She took her whoredoms to a whole new level, surpassing even her sister's whoredoms."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She was totally obsessed with the Assyrians, her neighbors. They were super stylish, with the fanciest clothes and the coolest rides - horseback riding on some sleek horses, surrounded by a bunch of attractive, young dudes."
Ezekiel,23,13,"And then I realized that she was corrupted, and they went in the same direction together,"
Ezekiel,23,14,"And she started being even more promiscuous: because when she saw men depicted on the wall, with images of the Chaldeans painted in vibrant colors,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"They wore fancy belts around their waists, stylishly adorned themselves with colorful headwear, and had the air of royalty, just like the cool kids from Babylon in Chaldea, their homeland."
Ezekiel,23,16,"And the moment she laid eyes on them, she was totally obsessed and immediately sent messages to them in Chaldea."
Ezekiel,23,17,"Then the Babylonians slid into her DMs, and their promiscuity tainted her purity. She got caught up in their mess, and her loyalty shifted away from the ones who truly cared. {Babylonians: meaning people from Babel} {alienated: meaning disconnected or distanced}"
Ezekiel,23,18,"So, like, she totally embraced her promiscuity and revealed her shame, ya know? And that's when I was like, done with her... just like I was done with her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"But she kept on indulging in promiscuity, reminiscing about her wild youth when she acted recklessly in Egypt."
Ezekiel,23,20,"She was obsessed with their flings, whose bodies are like those of donkeys and whose offspring is like horses'."
Ezekiel,23,21,"So basically, you remember how wild you were back in the day, messing around with those Egyptians and their questionable desires when you were still young and naive."
Ezekiel,23,22,"Yo Aholibah! Hear this from the Lord GOD: I'm gonna bring your exes back into your life, the ones you've been ignoring. They're coming at you from all directions!"
Ezekiel,23,23,"The Babylonians, Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and even the Assyrians too: they were all super attractive, high-ranking dudes and leaders, with tons of power and fame, riding around on horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"And they're gonna roll up on you with their sick rides, wagons, and wheels, along with a massive crew equipped with their shields, helmets, and defensive gear. It's gonna be intense, like a judgment day, where they'll lay down their own verdict on you."
Ezekiel,23,25,"And I'll be so jealous of you, like omg, and people are going to go so ham on you - like, seriously furious. They're gonna snatch your nose and ears, and anyone left is totally gonna get wiped out by some serious sword action. Your kids too, like, they're gonna be taken away, and whatever's left is gonna be totally devoured by fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,They'll totally snatch your outfit and snatch your dope bling. {dope...: Ornaments on you}
Ezekiel,23,27,So I'm gonna put an end to your messed up behavior and your promiscuity that started back in Egypt. You won't even give them a second glance or remember Egypt anymore.
Ezekiel,23,28,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD is saying: Check it, I'm gonna hand you over to those you totally can't stand, to those who you've completely drifted apart from."
Ezekiel,23,29,"And they're gonna treat you so poorly, take away everything you've worked for, and leave you totally exposed and vulnerable. Your shameful actions will be exposed for everyone to see, both your indecency and promiscuity."
Ezekiel,23,30,I'm gonna do these things to you ‘cause you've been chasing after those non-believers and getting all messed up with their idols.
Ezekiel,23,31,"You've been following in your sister's footsteps, so now I'm gonna pass her cup to you."
Ezekiel,23,32,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD says you're gonna have to sip from your sister's cup, and it's gonna be a mega-sized serving. Get ready to be straight-up laughed at and mocked, 'cause there's gonna be a ton of humiliation coming your way. It's gonna be a whole lot to handle, no joke."
Ezekiel,23,33,"You're gonna be totally wasted and feeling hella down, chugging the cup of shock and emptiness, just like your sis Samaria."
Ezekiel,23,34,"You're gonna chug it and slurp it all, and then you're gonna smash it to pieces and rip off your own boobs. 'Cause your boy God said so. Mic drop, Lord GOD out."
Ezekiel,23,35,"So, like, check it—God's saying this: 'Yo, you totally forgot about me and like, straight up ignored me. Because of that, you gotta deal with the consequences of your messed up actions and your promiscuity.'"
Ezekiel,23,36,"Yo, the LORD was talkin' to me like, 'Yo, son of man, you gonna judge Aholah and Aholibah? Like, you gotta straight up call out their messed up stuff, you know, their abominations and all that. Chill, you can also plead for 'em if you feel like it, no pressure'."
Ezekiel,23,37,"They've cheated on their partners and taken lives, engaging in unfaithfulness with their idols. They've even sacrificed their own children to these idols, burning them up."
Ezekiel,23,38,"Like, they seriously crossed the line with this, you know? They totally messed up my sacred place, and totally disrespected my chill Sundays."
Ezekiel,23,39,"So like, imagine this - they straight up sacrificed their own kids to their idols, and then had the audacity to waltz right into my sacred place on the same day, totally disrespecting it. Can you believe it? They pulled this messed up act right in the heart of my house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"And like, you even like called for these super cool dudes to come from, like, far away, and like, you totally sent a message, and like, dude, they actually came! You went all out, you know, like showered, put on some fresh makeup, and adorned yourself with fancy bling just to impress them!"
Ezekiel,23,41,"And you sat on a super fancy bed, and a dope table was all set up in front of it. You put my incense and my oil on it. {honourable: Hebrew word meaning super important}"
Ezekiel,23,42,"And there were a bunch of people chilling with her, having a good time. And some regular dudes brought Sabeans from out in the wilderness, who put cool bracelets on their wrists and dope crowns on their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"So I was talking to this person who's been around the block in terms of cheating and stuff, and I was like, are they seriously gonna keep hooking up with her, and she's gonna keep hooking up with them? Like, really?"
Ezekiel,23,44,"But they slept with her, like how people sleep with someone who acts promiscuously. That's how they slept with Aholah and Aholibah, the immoral women."
Ezekiel,23,45,"And, like, the righteous dudes, they'll totally call them out for being like, super sketchy and doing shady stuff, you know? 'Cause they're like, completely unfaithful and they've, like, done some seriously messed up things. It's, like, all on their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,"Yo, listen up fam! Here's what the Lord GOD said: I'm gonna gather a whole squad against them and let them get taken down and plundered. Like, they'll totally be removed and stripped bare. Trust, it's gonna go down!"
Ezekiel,23,47,"And like, the whole crew will like, throw rocks at them and attack them with swords, they'll straight up kill their kids and burn down their houses with fire. {dispatch...: or, like, single them out}"
Ezekiel,23,48,"So people, listen up! I'm gonna put an end to all this inappropriate stuff happening around here, so that everyone, especially the ladies, can learn to stop following your bad example."
Ezekiel,23,49,"And they'll make you pay for your wickedness, and you'll have to deal with the consequences of your idol worship. Then you'll finally realize that I, the Lord GOD, am in charge."
Ezekiel,24,1,"So, like, in the ninth year, on the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the LORD was, like, talking to me, and He said,"
Ezekiel,24,2,"Yo bro, write down the name of this lit day: it's the day when the king of Babylon came for Jerusalem, no cap."
Ezekiel,24,3,"Yo, listen up fam. Let me drop some knowledge on the rebellious crew. The Lord GOD be like, grab a pot, put it on the stove, and pour in some water, ya feel me?"
Ezekiel,24,4,"Put all the good parts, like the thigh and shoulder, together in one place. Make sure it's packed with the best bones."
Ezekiel,24,5,"Choose the finest animal from the herd, roast it thoroughly, and make sure to include the bones. Let it cook perfectly, and let the bones simmer in the pot."
Ezekiel,24,6,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD has to say: Dang, that city is messed up! It's like a pot full of gross stuff that just won't go away. Take it out, bit by bit, and let no good fortune come to it."
Ezekiel,24,7,"Her blood is all over the place. She put it on a rock, not on the ground, to avoid dust covering it."
Ezekiel,24,8,"So that their anger would rise and they'd seek revenge, I made sure their blood spilled on the highest ledge, where it couldn't be hidden."
Ezekiel,24,9,"So God's like, 'Yo listen up! This city is straight up messed up! I'm gonna make a massive bonfire outta all the wickedness.'"
Ezekiel,24,10,"Add lots of wood, light the fire, cook the meat thoroughly, season it perfectly, and make sure the bones are completely burned."
Ezekiel,24,11,"Put it on the fire until it's hot, burning, and gets rid of all the dirt and stains."
Ezekiel,24,12,"She's exhausted from all the deception, but her massive dishonesty isn't going away: it's gonna burn in the fire."
Ezekiel,24,13,"Your nastiness is pure unholiness: 'cause I've tried to clean you up, but you didn't get with the program, so now you're stuck in your filthiness and no amount of scrubbing will do until I unleash my rage upon you."
Ezekiel,24,14,"Listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, the LORD, has said it and trust, it's gonna go down for real. He ain't gonna backtrack, show no mercy, or change his mind. You're gonna be judged based on how you live and what you do, so says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,24,15,"So, like, God hit me up and was like,"
Ezekiel,24,16,"Yo, check it out, son of man. I'm gonna snatch away the precious things you hold dear, just like that. But don't even think about grieving or shedding any tears. You ain't gonna shed a single tear, fam."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Don't cry or mourn for the dead, keep your head held high, put on your shoes and don't cover your mouth, and don't eat any normal food."
Ezekiel,24,18,"So, like, I talked to the people in the morning, ya know? And then, in the evening, my wife passed away. But, you won't believe it, fam, I still did what I was supposed to do in the morning, just like I was told!"
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people were like, 'Yo, can you give us the lowdown on what the heck you're doing and why?'"
Ezekiel,24,20,"So, I was like, 'Listen up, guys!' The LORD dropped some knowledge on me and said,"
Ezekiel,24,21,"Yo, tell the peeps of Israel this message from the Lord GOD: Check it, I'm gonna disrespect my sacred place, the awesome power and beauty that you hold dear, the thing that your heart longs for, and even the loved ones you've left behind will suffer a violent end. (That's like, a major bummer for your soul, ya know?)"
Ezekiel,24,22,"And you gotta do what I've done: don't hide your voice, nor follow the trends."
Ezekiel,24,23,"And your swag will be on fleek with your kicks on your feet: no time for sadness or tears; instead, you'll feel the consequences of your wrongdoings, and show support for one another."
Ezekiel,24,24,"So, like, Ezekiel is basically a sign for you guys. Whatever he's done, you should do the same. And when all of this happens, you'll know for sure that I'm the one and only Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,24,25,"Yo, dude, listen up. When the day comes and I snatch away their power, the thing that makes them super happy, what they think is the coolest, the stuff they're totally obsessed with, their kids – well, it's gonna hit 'em HARD. The very core of their being will be shaken."
Ezekiel,24,26,Is anyone gonna come to you and spill the tea about what went down on that day?
Ezekiel,24,27,"On that day, you'll finally find the words to speak to those who have survived, and your silence will be broken. You'll become a living symbol to them, and they'll come to recognize that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,25,1,"God hit me up again with a message, like,"
Ezekiel,25,2,"Yo, dude! Listen up! It's time to speak out against the Ammonites. We gotta drop some sick prophecies on them, you feel me?"
Ezekiel,25,3,"Yo, listen up, Ammonites! The big man upstairs, God, has a message for you. He's saying, 'Yo, Ammonites, you think you're all that, talking trash about my holy place when it got messed up? And dissing the land of Israel when it was abandoned? And mocking the house of Judah when they were taken captive?' Yeah, that's what God's laying down."
Ezekiel,25,4,"Yo, check this out. So, I'm gonna hand you over to the guys from the east as their property. They're gonna totally settle in your land, build their palaces, and make their homes there. Oh, and get this: they're gonna enjoy all the juicy fruit and delicious milk that comes from you. And by the way, when it says menn,' it actually means childrenn' in Hebrew."
Ezekiel,25,5,I'm about to turn Rabbah into a legit camel parking lot and make the Ammonites chill spots for flocks. Then you'll realize that I'm totally the LORD and no one else.
Ezekiel,25,6,"So, like, this is what the Lord GOD is saying, right? 'Cause you were like clapping your hands and stomping your feet, and deep down in your heart, you were totally enjoying being all mean and spiteful towards the land of Israel, you know? Yeah, it's like that. *inserts relevant footnotes*"
Ezekiel,25,7,"Listen up, I'm about to flex on you real hard. I'm gonna let these non-believers snatch you up and exile you, cutting you off from everyone. You're gonna be wiped out, and then you'll finally realize that I'm the Almighty One. Trust."
Ezekiel,25,8,"Yo, this is what the Lord GOD says: Moab and Seir out here talkin' smack, sayin' that the house of Judah ain't no different from any other nation."
Ezekiel,25,9,"Yo, check this out, I'm about to expose Moab, like, reveal its weak spots and all. Those dope cities, the pride of their land, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim, they're about to get wrecked."
Ezekiel,25,10,"I'm gonna hand over the Ammonites to the dudes from the east so they can take over their land. After that, people won't even remember the Ammonites existed. #NoMoreAmmonites"
Ezekiel,25,11,And I'm gonna serve some serious justice to Moab; they'll totally realize that I'm the LORD.
Ezekiel,25,12,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD says: Edom totally messed with the house of Judah by seeking revenge. They seriously crossed the line and took matters into their own hands. It's like they were all about that revenge game, you feel me?"
Ezekiel,25,13,"So like, listen up, fam. This is what the big man upstairs, God himself, has to say: I'm gonna go all out on Edom. I'm talking total wipeout - no humans, no animals left. The whole place will be deserted, starting from Teman. And oh boy, those guys from Dedan? They're gonna meet their demise by the sword. No joke, it's gonna be brutal. And hey, just to clarify, when I say 'by the sword', I mean, like, all the way up until Dedan. No exceptions, yo."
Ezekiel,25,14,"And I will totally get back at Edom using my squad from Israel. They're gonna unleash my wrath and fury on Edom. They better recognize the wrath I'm bringing, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,25,15,"Listen up, fam! The Lord GOD has a message for y'all. Those Philistines, they sought revenge and showed pure spite as they tried to destroy things out of deep-seated hatred. Yeah, they were holding onto that grudge forever, I tell ya!"
Ezekiel,25,16,"So, listen up! God says, 'Check it out, I'm gonna flex on those Philistines. I'll wipe out the Cherethims and completely destroy the last bit of the coastal region. (Coastal region can also be called a haven of the sea.)'"
Ezekiel,25,17,"And I'm definitely gonna serve up some major payback to them, coming at them with intense and furious scoldings; and they'll totally realize I'm the one in charge when I unleash my revenge on them. {great vengeance: Heb. great vengeances}"
Ezekiel,26,1,"So, like, in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, I was just minding my own business when God hit me up with His message, you know?"
Ezekiel,26,2,"Yo, bro, check this out. God's talking to the dude, sayin' how Tyrus be dissin' Jerusalem, sayin' like, 'Haha, man, they done got wrecked, all those gates smashed, now they belong to me. I'm gonna come up big time, now that they're destroyed.'"
Ezekiel,26,3,"So, listen up! The Lord GOD is saying this: Yo, Tyrus, I'm gonna be straight up with you - I'm coming for you. I'm gonna bring a whole bunch of nations at you, like when the sea's waves come crashing in."
Ezekiel,26,4,"And they gonna totally wreck the walls of Tyrus, demolish her towers, fam. I'm gonna scrape off all her dust, till she's as plain as a frickin' rock."
Ezekiel,26,5,"This spot in the middle of the ocean will be perfect for casting out nets. You better believe it, because I, the Lord GOD, have said it! And it will become a total treasure for all the nations."
Ezekiel,26,6,"And, like, her daughters in the field? They're totally gonna get rekt by the sword. And, you know, they'll finally realize that I'm the LORD, fam."
Ezekiel,26,7,"Yo, listen up, fam! The Lord GOD has a message: Yo, check it, I'm 'bout to bring Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, who's like the boss of all kings, straight outta the north. He's rollin' in with horses, chariots, horsemen, companies, and a whole bunch of people."
Ezekiel,26,8,"He's gonna take out your daughters in the open, use weapons against you, build defenses, and come at you with force. {pour...: or, unleash the attack}"
Ezekiel,26,9,And he will bring out some serious firepower and use axes to demolish your defenses.
Ezekiel,26,10,"Because he has so many horses, their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake from the noise of the horsemen, wheels, and chariots when they enter through your gates, like how people enter a city that's been stormed."
Ezekiel,26,11,"He's gonna wreck your streets with his horse's hooves: your people are gonna get messed up by the sword, and your strong garrisons will be totally leveled."
Ezekiel,26,12,"They gonna totally raid your wealth and snatch up all your stuff, like seriously! They'll wreck your walls, demolish your dope houses, and toss your stones, wood, and dust right into the water. Straight savage, fam! Like, for real! 🙌"
Ezekiel,26,13,And I'm gonna make your banging tunes stop; your sick harp melodies won't be heard no more.
Ezekiel,26,14,"And I will totally make you as solid as a sick flow — a dope place to flex your skills. You won't be rebuilt again, because I, the LORD, have declared it, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,26,15,"Yo, check this out fam. The Lord GOD be sayin' to Tyrus like, won't the islands start shakin' when they hear 'bout yo downfall? I mean, think 'bout it. When peeps be cryin' out 'cause they hurtin', and there be killin' goin' on all 'round you, it's gonna be somethin', right?"
Ezekiel,26,16,"Once all the cool rulers of the ocean are done being all high and mighty, they'll ditch their fancy outfits and get all shaky with fear. They'll plop their butts on the ground and tremble non-stop, completely amazed by you. And I mean like, super duper trembling, if you catch my drift."
Ezekiel,26,17,"And they will like, totally mourn for you and be like, whoa dude, how did you get wrecked? You used to be the place where all the cool sailors hung out, like, such a famous city and so epic on the water. Everyone who came near it was totally scared of it, man! It was like, the boss of all the seas, you know?"
Ezekiel,26,18,"The islands gonna freak out when you go down. Like, they gonna be all shooketh, especially the ones chillin' in the sea. They gonna be like, 'Woah, dude, things ain't the same anymore!'"
Ezekiel,26,19,"Yo, check it out. This is what the Lord GOD says: When I turn you into a ghost town, just like those abandoned cities, and I bring in a huge flood to submerge you, like with mighty waters."

You're all full of yourself, claiming to be a god and chilling on your high and mighty throne in the middle of the ocean. But here's the thing, man, you're just a regular human. You may think you're God, but you're not. Don't get it twisted! Your heart may be as arrogant as a god's, but at the end of the day, you're still just a mortal.'"

Trust me, they'll have no doubt that I'm the all-powerful one in charge."
Ezekiel,28,24,"And the house of Israel won't have to deal with annoying haters or disrespectful people anymore, who used to bother them like annoying briers and thorns. They will realize that I am the mighty Lord GOD."

Ezekiel,29,2,"Yo, dude, listen up! I've got a message for you, son of man. Look straight at Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and start prophesying against him and the whole country of Egypt."
Ezekiel,29,3,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD says: Check it out, Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, thinks he's all that, like a massive dragon chilling in his rivers. He's claiming the rivers are his, acting like he made 'em for himself. But guess what? I'm totally against him."
Ezekiel,29,4,"But I'm gonna hook you up big time, like legit putting hooks in your jaws, and all the fish in your rivers will be like stuck to your scales. It's gonna be wild, bro! I'll totally bring you out of the rivers with all those fish hanging onto you, like a crazy fishing trip. No fish left behind, for real!"
Ezekiel,29,5,"And I'm gonna send you on a trip to the middle of nowhere, you and all the fish in your rivers. You'll end up in the wide open spaces, all scattered and not a chance of coming back together. Seriously, nature's gonna feast on you, both the land animals and the birds in the sky. It's gonna be a feast for them, no doubt about it."
Ezekiel,29,6,"And like, everyone in Egypt is gonna be like, totally aware that I'm the LORD because they've been, like, a weak support system for the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,29,7,"When they grabbed your hand, you totally flexed and ripped their shoulders apart. And when they relied on you, you totally snapped and made their whole bodies freeze up."
Ezekiel,29,8,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD has to say: Brace yourselves, cause I'm about to bring a major sword upon you, wiping out all humans and animals within your midst."
Ezekiel,29,9,"Egypt's gonna be a total ghost town, y'all, deserted and ruined. But hold up, they're gonna realize I'm the big boss, 'cause I straight up claimed that river as my own and I made it, okay?"
Ezekiel,29,10,"Listen up, I'm coming for you and your rivers. I'm gonna turn Egypt into a total ghost town, from Syene to the border of Ethiopia. It's gonna be a complete wasteland, no doubt about it."
Ezekiel,29,11,"No human or animal will step foot in it, and it won't be inhabited for forty years."
Ezekiel,29,12,"Yo, I'm gonna totally wreck Egypt and turn it into a ghost town. It's gonna be just like those other countries that are already wrecked, you know? For a whole 40 years, their cities will be totally abandoned and empty. And to top it off, I'm gonna scatter the Egyptians all over the place, spreading them out among different nations and countries."
Ezekiel,29,13,"But listen up, this is what the Lord GOD says: After forty years, I'm gonna bring the Egyptians back together from wherever they got scattered."
Ezekiel,29,14,"And I'll totally free the peeps in Egypt and bring them back to their homeland in Pathros, where they were born and used to live. But it's gonna be a bummer 'cause they'll be all lowkey and not as awesome as before, like, not very successful."
Ezekiel,29,15,"This kingdom gonna be the least cool; it won't act all superior to other nations anymore. I'm gonna make 'em less powerful, so they won't rule over any other nations again."
Ezekiel,29,16,"And it won't be the thing that the house of Israel relies on anymore, reminding them of their wrongdoings, when they search for it. But they'll understand that I'm the almighty Lord."
Ezekiel,29,17,"So, in the twenty-seventh year, on the first day of the month, I got a message from the LORD, like, He came up to me and said,"
Ezekiel,29,18,"Yo, listen up! So, this dude Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, had his army go all out on Tyrus. I'm talkin' shaved heads and peeling shoulders. But, get this, they didn't get paid a single cent for the service they did for Tyrus. Talk about a bad deal, man!"
Ezekiel,29,19,"So this is what the Lord GOD says: Listen up, I'm gonna hand over the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. He's gonna grab all their people, take their stuff, and capture their treasures. It's gonna be the payment for his army. Oh, and by the way, when I say 'take her spoil,' I mean he's gonna totally snag everything valuable, and 'take her prey' means he'll seize all their loot."
Ezekiel,29,20,"I hooked him up with Egypt as a reward for all the hard work he put in battling against them. They were basically working for me, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,29,21,"On that day, I'll make the house of Israel come alive and thrive, and I'll give you the words to speak among them. They'll finally recognize that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,30,1,"Yo, the LORD spoke to me again, like, 'Listen up,'"
Ezekiel,30,2,"Yo, dude, check it. God's sayin' this, so listen up. It's gonna get real rough, so brace yourself and let out a loud howl. This day is gonna be a total disaster!"
Ezekiel,30,3,"The day is like, super close, it's the day of the LORD, gonna be all cloudy and stuff; it's gonna be the time when all the non-believers will be getting their moment."
Ezekiel,30,4,"Yo, Egypt is gonna get wrecked by a sword, and Ethiopia's gonna feel the pain too. People gonna be droppin' like flies in Egypt, and they gonna snatch up all her peeps, leavin' her in ruins. It's gonna be intense, like mad fear and stuff."
Ezekiel,30,5,"Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, and all the mixed-up folks, along with Chub and the people in alliance, will go down in battle. (Libya is also called Phut in Hebrew, and the word menn' in Hebrew actually means childrenn')."
Ezekiel,30,6,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs says those who support Egypt are gonna bite the dust. The power and arrogance they flaunt will crumble. They're gonna topple from the tower of Syene, sword in hand, just like the Lord God said. Oh, and BTW, when I say Syene, I mean all the way from Migdol to Syene. That's how it's gonna go down."
Ezekiel,30,7,"And they're gonna be totally deserted in places that are already deserted, and their cities are gonna be right in the middle of cities that are already destroyed."
Ezekiel,30,8,"And everybody will know that I'm the LORD, when I start a massive fire in Egypt and all her allies get wrecked. (wrecked: Hebrew meaning broken)"
Ezekiel,30,9,"On that day, I'll send messengers sailing out to terrify the chill Ethiopians, and they'll feel a major dose of agony, just like Egypt was served back in the day. Brace yourselves 'coz it's coming!"
Ezekiel,30,10,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD says: I'm gonna make Egypt's crew vanish, thanks to Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king."
Ezekiel,30,11,"Him and his squad, the fearsome crew, gonna wreck the land: wielding their swords against Egypt, leaving bodies scattered all over."
Ezekiel,30,12,"I'm gonna totally dry up the rivers and let wicked peeps take over the land. It's gonna be a wasteland, all messed up by strangers. Don't doubt it, guys, the LORD said so! #DroughtModeActivated #LandInTrouble #StrangersTakingOver"
Ezekiel,30,13,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD has to say: I'm gonna wreck those idols and make their images disappear from Noph. There won't be any more rulers in Egypt, and I'll make everyone there straight up terrified."
Ezekiel,30,14,"And yo, I'm gonna wreck Pathros, light up the whole town of Zoan, and bring down judgment on No. {Zoan: or, Tanis}"
Ezekiel,30,15,"I'm gonna unleash my rage on Sin, the powerhouse of Egypt, and totally wipe out the masses in No. {Sin: or, Pelusium}."
Ezekiel,30,16,"And I'm gonna light up Egypt, man: Sin is gonna be totes anguished, and No is gonna be totally torn apart, and Noph is gonna go through some tough stuff every single day."
Ezekiel,30,17,"The cool guys from Aven and Pibeseth are gonna be taken down by swords, and these cities are gonna get captured. Aven, also known as Heliopolis, and Pibeseth, also known as Pubastum."
Ezekiel,30,18,"When it goes down at Tehaphnehes, things are gonna get real dark. I'm about to break those chains Egypt got going on. All that power and pride they got? Yeah, it's gonna disappear just like that. They'll be covered up by a thick cloud, and their people will be taken as prisoners. {darkened: or, restrained}"
Ezekiel,30,19,"So I'm gonna totally unleash some righteous judgments in Egypt, and they're gonna be like, 'Whoa, this is the real deal, it's the LORD at work!'"
Ezekiel,30,20,"So, like, in the eleventh year, on the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, right? He was like, 'Yo, listen up!'"
Ezekiel,30,21,"Yo, dude. Check it. I totally messed up Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. His arm is like totally broken, and no way is it gonna be fixed, no rollers or anything. It's too weak to hold a sword now. Bummer."
Ezekiel,30,22,"So, like, God's like, 'Listen up, Pharaoh, I'm totally coming for you, and I'm gonna wreck your arms - both the strong ones and the already messed up ones. And, just to add insult to injury, I'm gonna make you drop your sword too.'"
Ezekiel,30,23,"I'm gonna spread out the Egyptians all over the place, like they'll be living in different countries."
Ezekiel,30,24,"And I'll make the king of Babylon super strong, giving him my sword to hold. But I'm totally gonna shatter Pharaoh's arms, and he's gonna groan in pain like a seriously injured dude in front of Babylon's king."
Ezekiel,30,25,"But I gotchu, I'm gonna make the king of Babylon even more dope, while Pharaoh's power is gonna straight up flop. And everyone's gonna know it's me, the LORD, when I give the king of Babylon my sword and he totally wrecks Egypt with it."
Ezekiel,30,26,"And I'm gonna totally scatter the Egyptians all over the place, like, everywhere, in different countries and stuff. And they're gonna realize, like, for real, that I'm the LORD, you know?"
Ezekiel,31,1,"So like, in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month or whatever, God hit me up with a message, you know?"
Ezekiel,31,2,"Yo, dude! Listen up! Gonna drop some truth bombs on Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and his posse. Tell me, bro, who do you think you are, all high and mighty?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"Yo, check it out, the Assyrian dude was like a super tall tree in Lebanon, with some wicked nice branches, and had this cool shady vibe going on. He was like the tallest one up in the tree, with branches all thick and stuff."
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters boosted him up and raised him with its flowing rivers, surrounding his plants and sending out small rivers to all the trees in the field."
Ezekiel,31,5,"So this dude was like, super tall, taller than any other tree in the field. And his branches were like, everywhere, all over the place, because there were so many waters around him. It was like he was flexing his growth, you know? He was really branching out, sending his boughs shooting forth."
Ezekiel,31,6,"Like, all the birds in the sky built their nests in his cool branches, and all the wild animals had their babies under his rad branches, and all the powerful nations chilled out under his shade."
Ezekiel,31,7,"He looked fly with his massive size and long branches, and that's because his roots were planted next to some mad cool water."
Ezekiel,31,8,"No cap, the cedars in God's garden couldn't even compete with him: the fir trees couldn't match his swag, and the chesnut trees couldn't compare to his style; not a single tree in God's garden could match his stunning looks."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I made him look extra fly with all his branches, and all the trees in Eden, the ones chillin' in God's garden, couldn't help but be jelly."
Ezekiel,31,10,"So like, listen up, the Lord GOD's got something to say. 'Cause you totally got all high and mighty, standing tall and proud among all those branches, with your heart all full of yourself and stuff."
Ezekiel,31,11,"So, I've totally handed him over to this super powerful dude from another group. Trust me, he's definitely going to give him what he deserves. I had to kick him out because of all the messed up things he did."
Ezekiel,31,12,"And like, these random dudes from other countries, who are like super intense and scary, have totally taken him out and abandoned him. So, you know, his branches are all scattered on the mountains and in the valleys, and his limbs are like broken by all the rivers around. And like, literally everyone on earth has moved on from chilling in his shade and left him behind."
Ezekiel,31,13,"Like, when he falls, all the birds of the sky will totally chill there, and all the animals of the field will hang out on his branches, no cap:"
Ezekiel,31,14,"So that none of the cool trees by the beach act all superior because they're tall and their branches are thick, and so that none of their friends feel left out, because they're all gonna end up in the ground, with everyone else. #DownToThePit"
Ezekiel,31,15,"Yo, listen up: God says that when this person went down to the grave, I made everyone super sad. I covered the deep waters for him and held back the floods. I stopped the big waves from causing any damage. Even Lebanon was mourning for him, and all the trees in the field were like passing out from grief. {to mourn: Hebrew for 'to be black}"
Ezekiel,31,16,"I totally caused a whole commotion among the nations when I brought him down to the inferno along with all the others who go down to the deep abyss. And yo, all the amazing trees from the Garden of Eden, the finest ones from Lebanon, the ones that stay hydrated, they gonna be chilling and finding solace in the depths of the earth."
Ezekiel,31,17,"They, like, went down to the underworld with him, with the peeps who got killed. And his crew who had his back, they were chilling in the midst of the non-believers, under his protection and all."
Ezekiel,31,18,"Yo, who do you think you're all high and mighty like, compared to the trees in Eden? Well, let me tell you, you're gonna be brought down just like those trees to the deep depths of the earth. You'll end up with the rest of the uncircumcised folks who got killed by the sword. Yeah, I'm talking about Pharaoh and all his peeps, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,1,"So, like, it was the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that God's message came to me, you know?"
Ezekiel,32,2,"Yo, dude! Listen up, you 'bout to drop a sick rap for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. You're a straight-up beast, like a boss lion reppin' nations, and a massive whale dominating the seas. You rolled in with all your power, messin' up those waters with your stompin' feet and polluting their rivers. A true legend, yo!"
Ezekiel,32,3,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD be like, I'm about to cast my massive net over you with a whole crew of people. They gonna trap you up real good in my net, ya know?"
Ezekiel,32,4,"I'm gonna abandon you on the ground, toss you out in the open field, and let all the birds hang around on you. And to top it off, I'll make sure all the animals on earth have their fill with you."
Ezekiel,32,5,"I'm gonna put you up on the 'gram, flexin' on the mountains and slayin' in the valleys."
Ezekiel,32,6,"I'm gonna cover the whole land you're swimming in with your own blood, all the way to the mountains! The rivers will be overflowing with you, dude!"
Ezekiel,32,7,"And when I'm about to kick you out, I'll totally block the sky and darken all the stars. I'll cover the sun with a massive cloud, and the moon won't shine at all."
Ezekiel,32,8,"I'll totally dim all the lit-up stuff in the sky for you, and cover your land in darkness. God said that, just so you know. #GODmodeactivated"
Ezekiel,32,9,"I'm gonna seriously mess with a lot of people's heads when I bring about your total destruction among different nations and countries you never even heard of. It's gonna be so intense, like angering and grieving them at the same time, you know?"
Ezekiel,32,10,"Yo, I'm about to blow so many minds with how awesome you are. Kings gonna be shaking in their boots when I bust out my sword in front of them. They gonna be scared for their lives every second when you eventually go down."
Ezekiel,32,11,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD has something to say: Brace yourself, 'cause Babylon's king is pullin' out his sword, and it's comin' straight for ya!"
Ezekiel,32,12,"Yo, I'm gonna make your crew, the toughest dudes around, fall by the hands of mighty swords. All those terrifying nations, every single one of them, gonna wreck Egypt's flashy show-off vibes. The whole crew gonna be taken down."
Ezekiel,32,13,I'm gonna wipe out all those wild creatures near the massive waters. No more humans stepping on their turf or animals messing with them.
Ezekiel,32,14,"Yo, I'm gonna make their waters mad deep, and their rivers gonna flow like straight-up oil, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,15,"When I totally wreck Egypt, leaving it empty and devoid of everything it once had, and when I strike down all the people living there, that's when they'll finally realize that I'm the boss. Yeah, you heard it right. They'll know it's me, the LORD, with no doubt whatsoever. Just saying."
Ezekiel,32,16,"This is the sad song that people will sing to express their grief: girls from different nations will cry and mourn for Egypt and its large population, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,17,"So, like, it was the twelfth year, right? And on the fifteenth day of the month, BAM! The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,32,18,"Yo, dude, it's time to cry out for Egypt and bring them down, including the famous nations' ladies, all the way to the depths of the earth where it's like a never-ending darkness, with everyone heading down to the bottomless pit."
Ezekiel,32,19,Who's the hottest person these days? Time to take a chill pill and join the basic crowd.
Ezekiel,32,20,"They're gonna get caught up with all the people getting killed, stabbed and stuff. They're just handed over to the sword. Get out your weapons and take down the whole gang."
Ezekiel,32,21,"The powerful ones will reach out to him from the depths, accompanied by his allies. They have descended and they rest unyielding, defeated in battle."
Ezekiel,32,22,"Asshur and all her squad are there, surrounded by their graves. They've all been wiped out, fallen by the sword:"
Ezekiel,32,23,"There are hella graves in the pit, surrounded by her crew. They all got wrecked, slain by the sword, causing mad terror in the land of the living. (Or dismaying, you know)"
Ezekiel,32,24,"Bruh, Elam and all the homies chillin' by her grave got wrecked - like, sword-wrecked. They didn't even have that circumcision status and ended up in the deep depths of the earth. They were straight up causing fear all around, but now they're carrying that shame with them into the pit."
Ezekiel,32,25,"They gave her a cozy spot in the middle of the dead with all her crew. Graves surround her, filled with those who didn't go through the circumcision ritual, killed by the sword. Even though they scared the living out of everyone in the land, they still carry their shame as they head down to the grave. They're thrown in with the rest of the dead folks."
Ezekiel,32,26,"There's Meshech, Tubal, and all their squad: their graves surround them: all of them uncut, killed by the blade, even though they were straight up scary in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,27,"And they won't chill with the legendary fallen squad of the nonbelievers, who ended up in the depths of the underworld with their epic weapons. They stashed their swords under their heads, but their wrongdoings will haunt their bones, even though they were straight up terrifying to the powerful peeps in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,28,"Yeah, you'll totally get wrecked among the uncultured crowd, and end up kickin' it with those who got taken out by a sword."
Ezekiel,32,29,"So there's this place called Edom, and their kings and all their fancy rulers are now just lying around, completely defeated. They'll be chilling with those who didn't get the whole circumcision memo and also those who ended up in the underworld. It's like a seriously sad beatdown."
Ezekiel,32,30,"Yo, check out those northern princes and the Zidonians, they all got wrecked and are feeling totally embarrassed about their once mighty power. They're chilling with the slain, not even circumcised, and carrying the shame of those who bit the dust."
Ezekiel,32,31,"Pharaoh's gonna witness it and be like, 'Okay, I'm kinda relieved now.' Yeah, even Pharaoh and his whole army wiped out with the sword, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,32,"Yo, I totally scared the living daylights outta everyone in the land! And guess what? That Pharaoh dude, along with his army, is gonna end up among the defeated uncircumcised peeps, as declared by the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,33,1,"Once again, the LORD dropped me a message, like, totally saying,"
Ezekiel,33,2,"Yo, dude, listen up! So, say this to your peeps: When I decide to bring down the havoc and chaos upon a land, and the people there choose a person from their own crew to be their lookout, their eyes and ears on the lookout for danger, you know? Like, I'm about to bring some serious sword action, so they better be ready!"
Ezekiel,33,3,"If he's like, yo, I see the sword coming to the land, better grab that trumpet and warn everyone, fam."
Ezekiel,33,4,"If anyone hears the trumpet blast but doesn't take it seriously, when the attack comes and takes them away, it's on them. They're responsible for their own consequences. #NoWarningNoProtection"
Ezekiel,33,5,"He heard the sick beat of the trumpet, but didn't pay attention; it's his own fault if he gets into trouble. But if you actually pay attention, you can save yourself."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the lookout spots danger and doesn't raise the alarm, and the people aren't warned; if danger comes and takes someone away, they'll be responsible for their own wrongdoing, but I'll hold the lookout accountable for not doing their job."
Ezekiel,33,7,"Yo, dude, listen up! I'm appointing you as a lookout for the people of Israel. That means you gotta listen to my messages and give 'em a heads up from me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"Yo, when I tell the wicked, yo wicked person, you gonna straight up die; if you don't speak up and warn the wicked to change their ways, that wicked person's gonna die because of their wrongdoing, but I'll hold you responsible for their death."
Ezekiel,33,9,"But yo, if you warn the wicked to change their ways, and they don't, they gonna suffer the consequences; but at least you've saved yourself."
Ezekiel,33,10,"Yo, listen up! Son of man, it's time to drop some truth on the house of Israel. Here's the deal: You're constantly talking about how our mistakes and wrongdoings are weighing us down and making us feel like garbage. But here's the question: If that's the case, how are we supposed to thrive and find purpose in life?"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Yo, listen up, fam! This is a message straight from the Almighty: I swear on my authority as the Lord GOD, I ain't into seeing the wicked kick the bucket. Nah, what I want is for them to straighten up and start living right. So, all you wicked peeps out there, it's time to do a 180 and change your evil ways. Seriously, why would you wanna meet death, O house of Israel? Cut it out and choose life instead!"
Ezekiel,33,12,"Yo, bro, listen up! This is a message for all you people out there. Check it: just 'cause you do good things don't mean you're safe from messing up. And hey, even if someone's wicked, they can turn things around and bounce back. But yo, the righteous can't bank on their good deeds to save them when they mess up."
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I tell the good people that they'll live if they keep doing good, but then they think they're all that and start doing bad things, all the good they've done won't count anymore. They'll only be remembered for the bad stuff and they won't make it out alive."
Ezekiel,33,14,"Listen up, wicked people! If I tell you that you're gonna get wrecked, but you change your ways and start doing what's right and just, then you're in the clear. It's all about making things fair and square, ya know?"
Ezekiel,33,15,"If a bad person gives back what they took, follows the rules of a good life, and avoids doing wrong, they will definitely thrive and not face any consequences."
Ezekiel,33,16,He won't be reminded of any of the wrongs he's done; he's been about doing what's fair and good; he'll definitely thrive.
Ezekiel,33,17,"But the kids these days be like, 'God's ways ain't fair!' They may think they're right, but their ways ain't fair either."
Ezekiel,33,18,"If a righteous person stops being righteous and starts doing wrong, they will bring about their own downfall and face the consequences."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But if someone who's doing wrong decides to make a change and start doing what's right and fair, they'll live a better life because of it."
Ezekiel,33,20,"But y'all be saying, 'God's ways aren't fair.' Oh, people of Israel, I'm gonna judge each of you based on your own actions."
Ezekiel,33,21,"So, like, it happened in the 12th year of our captivity, like, you know, when we were held captive? Anyway, it was in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month and this person who managed to escape from Jerusalem came up to me and was all like, 'Dude, the city got smacked!'"
Ezekiel,33,22,"So, like, God totally had his hand on me in the evening, you know, before the one who escaped even showed up. And he made me speak, like, non-stop until morning when the person finally arrived. And, whoa, my mouth was opened, and suddenly I wasn't silent anymore!"
Ezekiel,33,23,"Yo, the LORD hit me up with a message like,"
Ezekiel,33,24,"Yo, dude. The peeps living in those empty parts of the land of Israel are sayin', like, Abraham was the main guy, and he got to own the land. But look at us, we're a whole bunch of folks here; the land is totally ours, it's our inheritance, man."
Ezekiel,33,25,"So, like, I gotta tell you something from the Lord GOD, okay? You guys straight up eat your food with the blood still in it, and you're all about checking out your idols, and you even spill blood. And you seriously think you deserve to own the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"You're out here flexing and doing some messed up stuff, messing with other people's relationships and all that. And now you think you deserve to have the land? Seriously?"
Ezekiel,33,27,"So like, tell them this, the Lord GOD says: Like, seriously, those in the deserted areas will totally be defeated by swords, and the ones chillin' in the open fields are gonna get snacked on by wild animals. And those peeps hiding out in forts and caves? They're gonna get wiped out by diseases and stuff. It's rough, man."
Ezekiel,33,28,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to wreck this place, leaving it totally abandoned. All those flashy displays of power will fade away, and the once vibrant mountains of Israel will become a ghost town where no one can pass through. Trust me, it's gonna be a total wasteland."
Ezekiel,33,29,"And they will finally realize that I am the LORD, once I've made the land a total mess because of all the messed up things they've done."
Ezekiel,33,30,"Yo, dude, people are still gossiping about you, bro. Like, they be chatting it up by the walls and doors of their houses, talking to each other like, 'Yo, come listen up, my dude, let's hear what the Lord gotta say.'"
Ezekiel,33,31,"And they come to you just like how people come, and they sit in front of you like my people, and they listen to your words, but they don't actually do them. They say they love you a lot, but deep down they're more interested in chasing after their own desires."
Ezekiel,33,32,"And, like, you're totally like a sick song with an awesome singer and mad skills on an instrument to them. They hear your words, but they don't actually do anything about it. (like, it's such a lovely jam, you know?)"
Ezekiel,33,33,"And like, when this actually happens (oh dude, it totally will), then they'll, like, realize that there was, like, a legit prophet in their midst."
Ezekiel,34,1,"So, like, God hit me up with a message, ya know, He was like,"
Ezekiel,34,2,"Yo, dude with a human vibe, drop some sick knowledge on those shepherds of Israel. Let 'em know, straight from the big man upstairs, that they're in deep trouble. Woe to those shepherds who are all about self-gain! Don't they realize their job is to take care of the flock?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"You munch on the best grub, rock the freshest fits, and straight up end the ones who have it all, but you don't even bother to nourish the squad."
Ezekiel,34,4,"You totally failed to support the sick folks, didn't bother to heal the ones who were ill, didn't bother to fix anything that was broken, didn't even bother to bring back those who were gone, and didn't bother to search for what was lost. Instead, you ruled over them with aggression and brutality. So not cool."
Ezekiel,34,5,"And they were all over the place, with no one to guide them: and they became easy prey for all the wild animals, when they were scattered. (without a shepherd)"
Ezekiel,34,6,"Bruh, my sheep were straight up wandering all over the mountains and high hills. Like, my flock was totally scattered all over the place, like, across the entire earth. And yo, nobody even bothered to look for or find them, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Ezekiel,34,7,"Yo, listen up, shepherds! Hear what the LORD has to say;"
Ezekiel,34,8,"Yo, swear to God, like for real, yo, my sheep got straight up wrecked. They became some tasty snacks for every wild animal out there, 'cause there was no one watching out for them, man. My shepherds failed to take care of 'em, they only cared about themselves and didn't feed my flock, you feel me?"
Ezekiel,34,9,"Yo, listen up, shepherds! Hear what the LORD has got to say;"
Ezekiel,34,10,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD says: Check it out, I'm totally against those shepherds. I'm gonna hold them responsible for my flock, and they won't be able to keep feeding them anymore. They won't even be able to eat for themselves. I'm gonna rescue my flock from their control so they can't make a meal out of them."
Ezekiel,34,11,"Yo, listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, God, is saying this: Check it, I'm gonna personally hunt down and find all my peeps, like a real detective."
Ezekiel,34,12,"Like, imagine a shepherd, right? He's like totally looking for his flock during the day when his sheep are all scattered and stuff. Well, I'm gonna do the same thing with my peeps! I'll find them wherever they've been scattered, even in the cloudy and dark times. No worries, I gotchu!✌️"
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I'll round up these peeps, bring 'em back from all over, and take 'em to their homeland. They'll chill on the dope mountains of Israel, grubbing by the rivers and all the lit spots in the land."
Ezekiel,34,14,I'm gonna hook them up with some premium grub on those lit mountains in Israel. They'll chill in cozy spots and feast on top-tier grassy fields.
Ezekiel,34,15,"I got my squad covered with snacks, and I'll make sure they chillax, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,16,"I'll look for what's been lost and bring back what's been pushed away, I'll fix what's broken and make stronger what's been sick. But those who are selfish and powerful, I'll take them down and teach them a lesson."
Ezekiel,34,17,"Listen up, fam! This is what the Lord GOD says to all of you in my flock: I'm about to lay down some divine judgment between different groups of animals - lambs and kids, rams and he-goats, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm gonna sort things out and make things right!"
Ezekiel,34,18,"Do you think it's no biggie that you've gobbled up all the primo grassy spots, but you keep stamping down and trashing the leftovers? And you've quenched your thirst with the cool refreshing waters, but now you're grossing them out with your dirty feet?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"And for my squad, they feast on what you've walked all over, and they sip on what you've made filthy with your kicks."
Ezekiel,34,20,"So this is what the Lord GOD says to them: Yo, check it, I'm gonna be the judge between the thick cattle and the skinny cattle."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Yo, you all been ruthless, shoving people aside and pushing all the weak ones around like it's a sport, even using your influence to scatter them in all directions."
Ezekiel,34,22,"So basically, I got my crew's back and they won't be getting messed with anymore. And trust me, I'll be the one making the call on who's the GOAT and who's just basic."
Ezekiel,34,23,"And I'm gonna appoint this one boss over them, and he's gonna take care of them, my loyal servant David. He's gonna make sure they're well-fed and protected, like a shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And like, I, the LORD, will totally be their God, and my servant David will be, like, this really awesome prince among them. I swear, I, the LORD, have straight up said it."
Ezekiel,34,25,"And I'll make a sick pact with them, getting rid of all the nasty wild creatures around. They'll live chill in the wilderness, catching some Z's in the woods without a worry."
Ezekiel,34,26,"And I'll totally bless them and everything around my spot, like, no doubts! I'll make it rain at the right time, like showers of blessings, you know?"
Ezekiel,34,27,"And like, the tree in the field will totally produce its fruit, and the earth will give its abundance, and they will be totally chill in their land, and they will know that I, like, totally am the LORD, when I break the chains that are holding them back and set them free from those who are using them for their own gain."
Ezekiel,34,28,"And they won't be easy targets for haters anymore, and no wild animals will attack them. They'll live in peace and security, and no one will be able to intimidate them."
Ezekiel,34,29,"And I'm gonna give them a super famous plant that will totally satisfy their hunger in the land, so they won't have to deal with haters and their shame anymore. {of renown: or, for real famous} {consumed: Heb. taken away}"
Ezekiel,34,30,"So, they'll know that I, the LORD their God, am with them. And that they, the house of Israel, are my squad, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,31,"And listen up, my squad, the squad of my turf, you guys are lit, because I'm your God, flexin' like the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,35,1,"So, like, the Lord spoke to me and was all like,"
Ezekiel,35,2,"Yo, dude, focus on mount Seir and share a prophecy about it."
Ezekiel,35,3,"Yo, listen up! The Lord God says to Mount Seir: I'm coming for you, straight up. I'm gonna flex my power on you, and you're gonna be totally wrecked. It's gonna be a heavy desolation, like, total wipeout."
Ezekiel,35,4,"I'm gonna wreck your cities, leaving them in ruins, so you'll be all abandoned, and you'll realize that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,5,"You've always been full of hate, always killing the Israelites when they were at their lowest, when their sins were coming to an end."
Ezekiel,35,6,"So, I swear on my life, says the Lord GOD, I'm gonna get you ready for some serious trouble, and trouble is gonna come after you: because you didn't despise violence, trouble is gonna come after you!"
Ezekiel,35,7,"I'm gonna totally wreck Mount Seir and block anyone from going in or out. It's gonna be a total ghost town, yo!"
Ezekiel,35,8,"And I'm gonna totally wreck his mountains with his dead boys: like, in the hills, valleys, and all the rivers, those dudes who get sliced up with swords, they're gonna bite the dust."
Ezekiel,35,9,"I'm gonna totally wreck your cities and they won't ever be the same again. And trust me, you'll know without a doubt that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,10,"Yo, you're out of line thinking that you can just claim these two nations and countries as yours, like you own everything. Just remember, the LORD is always present, no matter what. Don't disrespect."
Ezekiel,35,11,"So, like, listen up! The Lord GOD is saying, I swear on my life that I'm gonna totally give you what you deserve. I'm gonna show you just how pissed off and jealous you've been, all because you hate them. And guess what? I'm gonna make myself known to them, once I've dealt with you."
Ezekiel,35,12,"And you will realize that I'm the LORD, and I've heard all the disrespectful things you've said about the mountains of Israel, claiming they're totally destroyed and we can just take advantage of them. Just to devour, y'know."
Ezekiel,35,13,"So, like, you've been bragging about me and talking all this smack, saying all these things against me. I've totally heard it all. Seriously, trying to make yourself look bigger and better. Smh."
Ezekiel,35,14,"God's like, Listen up! When everyone else is having a blast, I'm gonna totally wreck you."
Ezekiel,35,15,"Yo, like when you were hella stoked about getting the land of Israel after it was all empty and stuff, I'm gonna do the exact same thing to you, Mount Seir and the whole Idumea and whatever. And trust, everyone's gonna know that I, the LORD, am in charge."
Ezekiel,36,1,"Yo, bro, check this out. It's time to drop some knowledge on the mountains of Israel. Listen up, mountains of Israel, 'cause the word of the LORD is about to be spoken:"
Ezekiel,36,2,"Listen up, says the Lord GOD! You won't believe what the enemy has been saying about you. They're all like, 'Ha! We totally own those ancient high places! They're ours now, no doubt.'"
Ezekiel,36,3,"So, like, listen up and spread the word, God is saying this: those people totally left you in ruins and absorbed you completely. They basically made you into a possession for the rest of the non-believers. Now, everyone is talking about you and you've become infamous among the people. It's all because of them, ya know? They've made you the topic of everyone's conversations."
Ezekiel,36,4,"Yo, mountains of Israel, listen up! The Lord GOD has something to say. This is what the Lord GOD is telling the mountains, hills, rivers, valleys, desolate places, and abandoned cities that got made fun of by other people: all those heathens that are around. (By the way, 'rivers' can also mean 'bottoms' or 'dales'.)"
Ezekiel,36,5,"So, like, the Lord GOD says: 'You know, I have totally spoken out of my burning jealousy against those leftover heathen people and all those Idumea dudes, who totally grabbed my land and were all, like, super stoked about it, with their hateful intentions, just to, you know, kick us out and take everything for themselves.'"
Ezekiel,36,6,"Yo, listen up! I got a message for the land of Israel. Check it, mountains, hills, rivers, and valleys, this is what the Lord GOD says: I'm speaking up 'cause y'all been taking crap from those non-believers. My jealousy and anger have been awakened, and I'm not about to let it slide."
Ezekiel,36,7,"So, like, the Lord GOD is saying, 'I swear, the people who don't believe in me that are around you, they're gonna face the consequences for their actions. They'll be really embarrassed.'"
Ezekiel,36,8,"Yo, mountains of Israel, you gonna flex those branches and drop some sweet fruit for my peeps in Israel 'cause they're about to roll through."
Ezekiel,36,9,"Yo, listen up! Check it out, I got your back and I'm totally vibing with you. I'm gonna come through for you and things are gonna get real fruitful - like your entire life is gonna be a whole garden, all cultivated and flourishing."
Ezekiel,36,10,"I'm gonna make the population boom, y'all. Like, all the people in the house of Israel—every single one of 'em. And you know what? The cities are gonna be lit, full of peeps living it up. No more empty spaces, we're gonna build them up again."
Ezekiel,36,11,"I'm gonna hook you up with hella humans and animals, and they gonna reproduce like crazy and be fruitful. I'm gonna make sure you're livin' large, even better than before. Trust me, I got this. You gonna see that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,12,"Yeah, I'm gonna let my squad, the people of Israel, step all over you and claim you as their own. You'll belong to them, and they won't lose anyone else from now on."
Ezekiel,36,13,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD has to say: Peoplee keep saying that you, {land}, are like, gobbling up humans and crushing nations.'"
Ezekiel,36,14,"So, like, you gotta stop attacking people and causing harm to your own nations, okay? That's what the Lord GOD is sayin'. Don't make your peeps suffer anymore, ya know?"
Ezekiel,36,15,"I won't let the world make fun of you anymore, and you won't have to deal with people insulting you or your country anymore, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,36,16,"Then God hit me up like,"
Ezekiel,36,17,"Yo, dude, listen up! So, God was talking to this guy, right? And He was like, 'Yo, son of man, back when the Israelites were living in their own land, they straight-up messed it up big time with their own messed-up choices and actions. Like, seriously, it was as disgusting as when a woman goes through her monthly thing.'"
Ezekiel,36,18,"So, basically, I got really mad at them because they went around killing people and worshiping these dumb idols, making the whole land dirty and messed up."
Ezekiel,36,19,"So, like, I totally spread them out all over the place, among all these different nations, you know what I mean? And, like, they were scattered all over the countries. I made judgments on them based on the things they did and the way they lived their lives."
Ezekiel,36,20,"So, when they went among the unbelievers, they totally disrespected my holy name by saying, 'These are the people of the LORD, they came from his land.'"
Ezekiel,36,21,"But, like, I couldn't help but feel bad for my holy name, you know? The house of Israel totally disrespected it in front of other nations, wherever they went."
Ezekiel,36,22,"So, listen up, fam! This is what the Lord GOD has to say to the house of Israel: I ain't doing this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name that y'all have disrespected among the non-believers, wherever you've been."
Ezekiel,36,23,"And I'll totally make my awesome name even more amazing, 'cause it got dissed big time by those non-believers, and you didn't really help either. But here's the deal: all those non-believers will know for sure that I'm the LORD, totally says the Lord GOD, when they see me becoming even more righteous through you. And I'm talking about right in their faces, you know. It's gonna be epic!"
Ezekiel,36,24,"I gotchu fam, gonna snatch you up from those outsiders, round you up from all over the globe, and plop you back in your homeland."
Ezekiel,36,25,"I'll shower you with fresh water and make you squeaky clean, getting rid of all the nasty stuff and idols that mess you up."
Ezekiel,36,26,"Yo, I got ya covered! I'm gonna hook you up with a fresh new heart and a dope new spirit. Say goodbye to that stubborn and all rigid heart of yours, I'm gonna replace it with a tender and compassionate heart that's 💯!"
Ezekiel,36,27,"And I'll inject my vibe into you, and make you totally follow my guidelines, and you'll stay true to my rules and rock them."
Ezekiel,36,28,"And you're gonna live in the land I gave to your parents. You'll be my people, and I'll be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,"I got you covered, fam! I'll keep you clean from anything that's not cool, and I'll make sure you have plenty to eat, no shortage in sight."
Ezekiel,36,30,"And I'm gonna make the tree's fruit and the field's bounty multiply, so you won't have to deal with any more hate from other countries saying you're starving."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Yo, once you peeps realize how messed up your ways were, all the shady stuff you did that wasn't cool, you're gonna be like, so disgusted with yourselves for all the wrongs you've done, and all the messed up things you've done, it's gonna be rough, man."
Ezekiel,36,32,"I'm not doing this for you, okay? Just so you know, says the Lord GOD. You should totally feel embarrassed and clueless about your own messed up choices, O house of Israel."
Ezekiel,36,33,"Yo, listen up! The Lord GOD says that when I've washed away all your wrongdoings, I'm gonna hook you up with some super cool cities to live in. And you know what? We're gonna turn those deserted places into something awesome!"
Ezekiel,36,34,"And the barren land will be cultivated, where it was once desolate for everyone who passed by it."
Ezekiel,36,35,"And they'll be like, Yo, check it! This land that used to be all empty and wasted is now straight up like a sick garden of Eden; and those run-down cities that were all destroyed and trashed? Yeah, they're all protected and filled with people now."
Ezekiel,36,36,"And all the people out there will see that it's me, the LORD, who restores and revitalizes the broken spots. I, the LORD, have declared it and I'll make it happen, no doubt about it."
Ezekiel,36,37,"Yo, listen up fam! The Almighty, the Big Boss upstairs, is straight up saying this: I'm totally down to hear out the peeps of Israel and do what they ask. I'm gonna multiply 'em with hella people, just like a big flock, you know?"
Ezekiel,36,38,"Just like a rad crew at a lit festival in Jerusalem, the deserted cities will be packed with awesome people, and they'll realize that I'm the real deal, the LORD. #holysquadgoals #blessed"
Ezekiel,37,1,"Yo, the power of the LORD was all over me, and I was like transported by the vibes of the LORD, and ended up in this valley that was straight up packed with bones,"
Ezekiel,37,2,"So I walked all around them, and guess what - there were a ton of them in the wide valley, and man, were they parched. Like, seriously dried up."
Ezekiel,37,3,"So, like, God was all like, 'Hey dude, can these bones actually come back to life?' And I was like, 'Oh Lord God, you totally know the answer to that.'"
Ezekiel,37,4,"Then he said to me again, go ahead and prophesy over these bones and tell them, 'Yo, lifeless bones, listen up to what the LORD is saying.'"
Ezekiel,37,5,"Yo, peep this, the Lord GOD has a message for these bones: Check it, I'm about to bring the breath of life into you, and you gonna come alive, no cap!"
Ezekiel,37,6,"And I'll hook you up with some sick muscles, make your body all fleshed out, wrap you in some fresh skin, and give you the breath of life. You'll be totally alive, and you'll realize that I'm the LORD."
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I did what I was told and started prophesying. And while I was at it, something crazy happened - there was like this loud noise, and woah, everything started shaking. And get this, the bones all like came together, one bone fitting perfectly with another bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"So, like, I looked, and whoa, these muscles and flesh appeared on them, and then the skin covered them up, but they totally didn't have any breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"And he said to me, yo, speak to the wind, like, for real, son of man, and say to the wind, this is what the Lord GOD is saying: Come from all directions, oh breath, and blow on these dead peeps, so they can come back to life. {wind: or, breath}"
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I did what he told me, and they suddenly came alive and stood up as a massive army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"So he was like, bro, these bones represent all of Israel, you feel me? They're saying our bones are dried up, our hope is gone, and we're totally cut off."
Ezekiel,37,12,"Yo, listen up! I got a message for you from the Lord GOD. Check it: My homies, get ready for some next-level awesomeness. I'm about to bust open your graves and bring you back to life. Not just that, but I'm also gonna take you to the land of Israel. It's gonna be lit, fam!"
Ezekiel,37,13,"And you'll totally realize that I, like, the Almighty, have totally made it happen when I've, like, opened up your graves, my peeps, and like, brought you out of those graves, ya know?"
Ezekiel,37,14,"And I'll put my vibe in you, and you'll be living your best life in your own territory. Then you'll realize that I, the LORD, totally said it and made it happen. Period, God is speaking."
Ezekiel,37,15,"So like, I got a message from the LORD, yo, and he was all like, 'listen up'"
Ezekiel,37,16,"Yo, listen up, dude. Grab a stick and label it Judahh and the crew of Israel.' Then, grab another stick and label it Josephh, Ephraim's homie, and all the Israel fam.'"
Ezekiel,37,17,"Like, take those sticks and totally connect them together into one big stick, and it's gonna be super solid in your hand."
Ezekiel,37,18,"And when your homies come up to you, like, yo, can you break down what you're tryna say with all this stuff?"
Ezekiel,37,19,"Yo, tell 'em this is what the Lord GOD says: Check it out, I'm gonna grab that stick of Joseph, the one held by Ephraim, along with the tribes of Israel who roll with him. Then I'll stick 'em together with the stick of Judah, and fuse them into one big stick. They'll be united in my hand, no doubt."
Ezekiel,37,20,And the signs you make will be in your hand right in front of them.
Ezekiel,37,21,"And tell them, listen up, this is what the Lord GOD says: Yo, I'm gonna grab the children of Israel from all the different places they've scattered to, and I'll bring them back to their own land, gathering them from every direction!"
Ezekiel,37,22,"And I'll bring them together as a tight squad in the land on the epic hills of Israel. They'll rally under one ruler, no more divisions, no more splitting into different factions or kingdoms ever again!"
Ezekiel,37,23,"They won't mess with their idols or any gross stuff or their bad deeds anymore. I'll rescue them from all the places they've messed up, and purify them. Then they'll be my crew and I'll be their ultimate OG."
Ezekiel,37,24,"And David, my homeboy, gonna be their king; and they all gonna have one dope leader. They'll also roll with my rules, keep my laws, and actually follow 'em."
Ezekiel,37,25,"And they're gonna live in the land that I've given to Jacob, my servant. That's where your ancestors have lived, and they're gonna live there too, along with their kids and their grandkids, for like, forever. Oh, and David, my servant, he's gonna be their forever prince."
Ezekiel,37,26,"Yo, I'm gonna hook them up with a super chill peace deal. It's gonna be legit everlasting, you feel me? And I'm gonna hook them up with a sick spot to live, and they're gonna be hella abundant in numbers. Oh, and I'm totally gonna establish my epic holy place right in the middle of them for all time, no cap."
Ezekiel,37,27,"I'm totally gonna vibe and chill with them in their place, you know? Like, I'll totally be their God and they'll be my peeps. No cap."
Ezekiel,37,28,"And the non-believers will totally realize that I, the LORD, am making Israel sacred, like, when my holy place is right there with them for, like, eternity."
Ezekiel,38,1,"So, like, the LORD was all like, 'Hey, listen up! I've got something to say!'"
Ezekiel,38,2,"Yo dude, listen up! God wants you to check this out - there's this guy called Gog, and he's from a place called Magog. He's like the main dude in charge of Meshech and Tubal. God wants you to drop some serious prophecies on him, like, lay it all out against him!"
Ezekiel,38,3,"And I'm like, listen up, Gog, you're about to face me, the all-powerful Lord GOD. Yeah, you're the top dog of Meshech and Tubal, but I got my eyes on you."
Ezekiel,38,4,"And I'll totally flip you around, grab you with these hooks in your mouth, and drag you out with your entire squad - horses, riders, all suited up in killer armor, a massive crew with shields and swords."
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya rollin' deep with shields and helmets. (Libya can also be called Phut, just FYI)"
Ezekiel,38,6,"Gomer, and all their squads; the crew of Togarmah from up north, and all their squads; and a whole bunch of people with you."
Ezekiel,38,7,"Get ready and make preparations for yourself and your whole squad that's with you, and make sure to protect and look out for them."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After a hot minute, you'll get a visit. Like, in the far future, you'll end up in this place that was totally wrecked, but now it's all rebuilt and populated by a bunch of peeps. It's all happening in the mountains of Israel, which have always been deserted, but now it's brought back to life from all these different nations, and they're all chilling in a safe zone."
Ezekiel,38,9,"You're gonna come like a boss, all fierce and unstoppable, like a massive cloud covering the whole place, bringing your squad and a bunch of peeps with you."
Ezekiel,38,10,"Yo, listen up! God says, in the future, some crazy thoughts might pop into your head. Like, you might start plotting something not-so-good. Mind your thoughts, folks!"
Ezekiel,38,11,"And you gotta be like, yo, I'mma head to that place where there ain't no walls around the towns. I'mma chill with those peeps who are livin' in peace, feelin' secure. They got no walls, no bars, and no gates, ya feel?"
Ezekiel,38,12,"To flex and snatch all the swag; to go after those empty spots that are now poppin' and the people who've come together from all over, stackin' up their cash and treasures, livin' it up right in the heart of the scene."
Ezekiel,38,13,"Yo, Sheba, Dedan, and the Tarshish traders, along with all their young lions, gonna be like, 'Yo, what's up? You tryna come and snatch some stuff? You bringin' your crew to steal some loot? You wanna grab some cash, bling, livestock, and all those goods to make a big score?'"
Ezekiel,38,14,"Yo, dude! Listen up, son of man! Get ready to speak some prophetic words to Gog. The Lord GOD has a message for you: When the day comes and my people of Israel are living in peace and security, won't you realize what's going down?"
Ezekiel,38,15,"So like, you'll totally jet from up north, bringing a bunch of peeps along, all ridin' on horses, a massive crew with an epic army:"
Ezekiel,38,16,"Bruh, you gonna come at my squad, the peeps of Israel, like a massive cloud takin' over the whole land. This gonna go down in the future, when I'm gonna bring you against my turf so all those non-believers can see how I'm gonna be glorified through you, Gog, right in front of their eyes."
Ezekiel,38,17,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD has to say: Are you the one I was talking about back in the day, through my prophet homies in Israel? They were dropping mad prophecies, saying you were gonna come and wreck them? (By the way, 'by' means 'through' in Hebrew.)"
Ezekiel,38,18,"And like, when Gog tries to mess with Israel, the Lord GOD is like, 'Yo, I'm gonna get so mad, it's gonna show on my face.'"
Ezekiel,38,19,"Like, dude, I'm totally fired up and super mad. I'm like, obsessed with protecting what's mine, ya know? So, brace yourselves, 'cause on that day, things are gonna get mega intense in the land of Israel. It's gonna shake things up big time!"
Ezekiel,38,20,"So, like, all the fish in the sea, birds in the sky, animals in the fields, all the creepy crawlers on the ground, and every single person on the face of the earth, they're gonna tremble when they see me. It's gonna be epic, dude. Mountains are gonna crumble, steep hills will collapse, and every wall will come crashing down. No doubt, it's gonna be insane!"
Ezekiel,38,21,"I'm gonna summon some serious sword action on him, like, all over my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. Like, even bros gonna fight and turn their own swords against each other."
Ezekiel,38,22,"And I'm gonna go all out on him with some serious bad luck, like diseases and blood. I'll bring down a major storm on him, his crew, and all the peeps with him. It'll be raining like crazy, with huge hail, fire, and sulfur."
Ezekiel,38,23,"So, watch me flex and elevate myself; I'll make myself holy and be recognized by nations far and wide. They'll finally get that I'm the real deal, the LORD."
Ezekiel,39,1,"Yo, dude! Listen up! This is the word of the Lord GOD for you, son of man. I want you to go and prophesy against Gog, who thinks he's all that. Like, seriously, I'm coming for you, Gog, you big shot ruler of Meshech and Tubal!"
Ezekiel,39,2,"And I'll be straight up, I'm gonna make you turn back and only leave like a sixth of you standing. Then I'm gonna bring you up from the north and take you to the mountains of Israel. It's gonna be wild, like I might hit you with six crazy plagues or reel you in with a totally gnarly hook with six sharp teeth. Oh, and by the way, when I say 'the north parts,' I mean the sides of the north. Just so you know."
Ezekiel,39,3,"And I'll totally wreck your bow and make all your arrows flop right out of your hand, dude."
Ezekiel,39,4,"You're gonna get wrecked on the mountains of Israel, along with all your crew and the people with you. I'mma serve you up to all kinds of hungry birds and savage animals in the field. They'll chow down on you like a buffet."
Ezekiel,39,5,"You're gonna totally faceplant in the wide open field, 'cause I've said so, says the Lord GOD. It's like, no escaping it, dude. The field is where you'll go down."
Ezekiel,39,6,"And I'm gonna drop some fire on Magog, and those chillin' casually on the islands gonna feel it too: and they gonna know that I'm the LORD. (casually: or, confidently)"
Ezekiel,39,7,"I'm gonna flex and show off my holy name to my peeps in Israel. No one better mess with my holy name anymore, alright? And all those non-believers are gonna realize that I'm the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. Ya feel me?"
Ezekiel,39,8,"Yo, listen up! It's about to go down, God himself said so. This is the day I've been talking about, and now it's finally happening."
Ezekiel,39,9,"The people living in the cities of Israel will come out and light up a big bonfire. They'll burn all the weapons like shields, bows, arrows, and javelins for a whole seven years."
Ezekiel,39,10,"So like, they won't like, take any wood from the field or cut down any from the forests, 'cause they'll straight up burn these weapons with fire, you know? And they'll totally spoil those who spoiled them, and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,11,"And on that day, I'm gonna hook up Gog with a burial spot in Israel, in this place called the valley of the cool kids on the east side of the sea. It's gonna be so iconic that it'll leave everyone speechless. They'll lay Gog and all his squad to rest there, and they're gonna name it The valley of Hamongog. (Just so you know, Hamongog means the crew of Gog.)"
Ezekiel,39,12,"And it's gonna take the Israelites a solid seven months to bury all those people, just so they can purify the land and stuff."
Ezekiel,39,13,"Yeah, everyone in the whole land will be totally hype to bury them, and it's gonna be a legendary day when I, the Lord GOD, shine like never before!"
Ezekiel,39,14,"And they'll choose people who will have a full-time job, traveling throughout the land to bury the bodies of those who are left on the earth, to make it clean. They'll search for seven months until they're done."
Ezekiel,39,15,"When people are traveling through the land and they come across a human bone, they should put up a sign next to it until the proper burial crew has taken care of it in the valley of Hamongog."
Ezekiel,39,16,"And hey, this city's gonna be called Hamonah. And that's how they'll clean up the whole land. Hamonah, you know? It means a whole bunch of people."
Ezekiel,39,17,"Yo, dude! Listen up, son of man. This is what the Lord GOD wants you to do: Talk to all the birds and animals out there, and tell them to gather 'round for a massive feast I'm putting together for you. It's gonna be lit, happening on the mountains of Israel. You'll get to chow down on some serious meat and guzzle down some blood. So get ready to party, my dudes!"
Ezekiel,39,18,"You'll feast on some serious food, savoring the very best cuts of the land. Get ready to chow down on rams, lambs, goats, and prime beef from Bashan. (FYI: 'goats' here means big, powerful goats)"
Ezekiel,39,19,"And you will indulge in the juiciest food until you're totally satisfied, and consume the tastiest drinks until you're absolutely inebriated, from the offerings I have made for you."
Ezekiel,39,20,"So basically, my fam, I'm gonna hook you up with all the good stuff. Picture this: a lit feast with hella horses and chariots, badass warriors, and all the troops you could ever need, ya feel? The Lord God is straight up promising you all that, no cap."
Ezekiel,39,21,"I'm gonna flex my awesomeness to all the non-believers, and they'll witness firsthand the justice I'm dishing out and the power I'm throwing their way."
Ezekiel,39,22,"So the squad of Israel will totally know that I'm the LORD, their God, from that day and on."
Ezekiel,39,23,"And all those non-believers will realize that the Israelites were taken into captivity because of their wrongdoing. They rebelled against me, so I turned away from them and let their enemies take control. Consequently, they all met their downfall in battle."
Ezekiel,39,24,"I treated them based on how messed up they were and how much they messed up themselves, and I turned away from them and acted like they didn't even exist."
Ezekiel,39,25,"So like, listen up fam! Here's what the Lord GOD is sayin': I'm gonna bring back Jacob's peeps from captivity, show mad love to all the peeps in Israel, and I'm gonna be all protective of my holy name, ya feel me?"
Ezekiel,39,26,"Once they've suffered the consequences of their actions and all the wrongs they've done to me, while they were living securely in their own territory without anyone to threaten them."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I've retrieved them from their enemies and assembled them back together, making myself holy through their restoration in the presence of many nations;"
Ezekiel,39,28,"And they'll finally realize that I'm their cool God, who let them be taken captive by those other guys, but now I've brought them back to their own turf, and not a single person is left behind."
Ezekiel,39,29,"I won't ghost them anymore, 'cause I've totally spilled my vibe on the crew in Israel, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,40,1,"In year 25 of our captivity, at the start of the year, on the 10th day of the month, 14 years after the city was attacked, on that very day, the power of the LORD was on me and took me there."
Ezekiel,40,2,"God showed me a dope vision where he took me to Israel and placed me on a mad high mountain. It was like a city skyline to the south, fam. (Or like, it was literally on the mountain, you know?)"
Ezekiel,40,3,"So, like, he took me to this place and, woah, I saw this guy who looked legit like he was made of brass. He was holding a line of flax in one hand and a measuring reed in the other. And he was just chilling at the gate, you know?"
Ezekiel,40,4,"And the dude was like, yo, listen up, Son of man, pay attention and take note of everything I'm about to show you. It's important stuff, so get your heart into it. The reason you're here is so I can show you this, so don't hold back - tell the house of Israel everything you see."
Ezekiel,40,5,"Yo, there was this sick wall all around the crib, and this dude had a ruler that was like six cubits long, you know? He measured the width of the building, and it was one ruler, and the height was also one ruler."
Ezekiel,40,6,"He then approached the gate facing east and went up its stairs to measure the width of the gate's threshold. It was one reed wide, just like the other threshold of the gate. The gate faced toward the east."
Ezekiel,40,7,"Each small room in the temple was as wide and tall as a skateboard, with a space of about three meters between each room. The entrance of the gate leading to the inner courtyard was also the same size as a skateboard."
Ezekiel,40,8,"He also measured the entrance area of the gate inside, it was one unit of measurement."
Ezekiel,40,9,"He checked out the entrance to the gate, it was eight cubits wide, and the posts were two cubits thick. The entrance to the gate was facing inward."
Ezekiel,40,10,"And there were three little rooms on the east side of the gate, and three on the west side; all of them were the same size. The posts were also of the same size on both sides."
Ezekiel,40,11,"He checked out the size of the gate entrance, which was like 10 cubits wide, and the length of the gate was around 13 cubits."
Ezekiel,40,12,The area in front of the small rooms was one cubit wide on each side. The small rooms themselves were six cubits wide on each side. (Space here refers to a boundary or limit.)
Ezekiel,40,13,"Then he measured the gate from one little chamber's roof to another: it was 25 cubits wide, with doors aligned perfectly."
Ezekiel,40,14,"He also constructed tall pillars that measured sixty cubits, reaching all the way to the boundary of the courtyard surrounding the entrance."
Ezekiel,40,15,"And from the front of the entrance gate all the way to the front of the porch of the inner gate, there were fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,40,16,"And the little rooms had small windows, with posts all around the gate, and there were also windows in the arches. The windows faced inward and on each post there were palm trees."
Ezekiel,40,17,"So he took me to the courtyard, and yo, there were some sick rooms and a lit walkway all around the court: there were like 30 rooms on that dope pavement."
Ezekiel,40,18,"The pathway next to the gates, running alongside the gates, was the lower pathway."
Ezekiel,40,19,"So he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court, which was 100 cubits in the eastward and northward direction."
Ezekiel,40,20,"So, like, this dude measured the length and width of the gate on the outer court that faces the north. You know, the one with its face towards the north. #MeasuringGoals"
Ezekiel,40,21,There were three small rooms on one side and three on the other side. The posts and arches were the same size as the first entrance: 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. (Arches can also be called galleries or porches.)
Ezekiel,40,22,"The windows, arches, and palm trees were all designed based on the dimensions of the gate facing east. You climbed up to it using seven steps, and the arches stood in front of you."
Ezekiel,40,23,"So there was this gate in the inner court, right across from the gate to the north and east. They measured the distance between the gates and it was like a hundred cubits or whatever."
Ezekiel,40,24,"Then, he took me to the southern side, and guess what? There was a gate facing south! He made sure to measure the posts and arches accurately."
Ezekiel,40,25,"So, like, this epic building had windows all over, like even in the badass arches. And these windows were just like the other ones, you know? The length of the building was like fifty cubits, and the width was like twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,26,"This lit place had like, seven steps to climb up, and there were these cool arches in front. And there were palm trees, one on each side, like adding some major aesthetic vibes to the whole setup."
Ezekiel,40,27,"There was, like, a super cool gate in the inner court on the south side. And this dude, he totally measured from one gate to another on the south side, and it was like a hundred cubits, man!"
Ezekiel,40,28,"Then he took me to the chill inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate using these dimensions;"
Ezekiel,40,29,"And there were these cool little rooms, and the cool beams, and the cool arches, all measured out and stuff. And there were windows in it and in the arches all around, like super chic. It was 50 cubits long, and 25 cubits wide. So dope!"
Ezekiel,40,30,And the arches all around were 25 cubits long and 5 cubits wide.
Ezekiel,40,31,"The entrances faced the outer courtyard, with cool palm trees decorating the pillars. There were eight steps leading up to it."
Ezekiel,40,32,"And he like, led me into the super exclusive inner court on the east side: and he totally measured the gate using those specific measurements."
Ezekiel,40,33,"And the cool rooms, the cool posts, and the cool arches were all measured just right. There were even windows all around, making it a chill hangout spot. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,34,"The entryways faced the outer courtyard, and there were palm trees on the posts on both sides. To get to it, there were eight steps going up."
Ezekiel,40,35,He took me to the north gate and measured it using these measurements;
Ezekiel,40,36,"There were these small rooms inside, with the beams, frames, and windows all around. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,37,"The walls faced the outer courtyard and had palm trees carved into them on both sides, and there were eight steps leading up to it."
Ezekiel,40,38,"And the rooms and the entrances were next to the gate posts, where they cleansed the burnt offering."
Ezekiel,40,39,"And at the entrance of the gate, there were two tables on one side, and two tables on the other side. They were used to carry out the burnt offering, sin offering, and trespass offering."
Ezekiel,40,40,"On the outside, next to the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables. And on the other side, near the entrance of the gate, there were two tables as well."
Ezekiel,40,41,"There were four tables on one side, and four tables on the other side, next to the gate; making it a total of eight tables where they offered their sacrifices."
Ezekiel,40,42,"And the four tables were made of solid stone for the burnt offering, measuring a cubit and a half in length and a cubit and a half in width, and one cubit in height. That's where they put the tools they used to kill the animals for the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
Ezekiel,40,43,"And there were these sick hooks, like, hella broad, all secure and stuff; and on the tables there was the flesh of the offering. It's like those hooks could be used as andirons or even as the two hearthstones, you know?"
Ezekiel,40,44,"And there were cool rooms for the singers near the inner gate of the courtyard, by the north gate. They had a great view towards the south, while another room by the east gate had a view towards the north."
Ezekiel,40,45,"And he was like, 'Yo, check out this lit room! It's facing the south and it's totally for the priests, who are responsible for taking care of the house."
Ezekiel,40,46,"The north-facing room is where the priests, who are responsible for taking care of the altar, stay. These are the cool guys from the Zadok crew, part of the Levi squad, who get to be close to the LORD and serve Him."
Ezekiel,40,47,"He checked out the court, all swag with its hundred cubits long and hundred cubits wide, all square and stuff. And the altar in front of the house, chill vibes!"
Ezekiel,40,48,Then he took me to the front of the house and measured each post of the porch. They were five cubits wide on one side and five cubits wide on the other side. The gate itself was three cubits wide on one side and three cubits wide on the other side.
Ezekiel,40,49,"The porch was like 20 cubits long and 11 cubits wide. Dude, I was led up there by these cool steps. And there were pillars by the posts, like one on this side and another on that side. Super rad vibes."
Ezekiel,41,1,"Then he took me to the temple and measured the posts. They were, like, six cubits wide on both sides, which was the same width as the tabernacle."
Ezekiel,41,2,"And the size of the door was 10 cubits wide, with each side measuring 5 cubits. The length was 40 cubits and the breadth 20 cubits. (door: or, entrance)"
Ezekiel,41,3,"So he went inside and measured the doorpost, which was two cubits wide. The door itself was six cubits tall, and the width of the door was seven cubits."
Ezekiel,41,4,"So he whipped out his measuring tape and measured it, like, 20 cubits in length and 20 cubits in breadth, right in front of the temple. And he was like, 'Yo, this is totally the most holy place ever!'"
Ezekiel,41,5,"So like, he measured the wall of the house, it was like six cubits, and the width of each side room was four cubits, all around the house on every side."
Ezekiel,41,6,"And there were three stacked side chambers, totaling thirty in a row. They were built into the walls of the house to provide support, but they weren't actually attached to the main structure."
Ezekiel,41,7,"So, like, the house had these rooms that were expanding and going up which was pretty cool. It was like this spiral thing that went all around the house, making it wider as it went up. So, from the lowest floor to the highest floor, it gradually got bigger in the middle. It was like...whoa."
Ezekiel,41,8,"So, like, I looked at the house and it was, like, super tall and stuff, and the side rooms had these, like, huge foundations that were, like, six cubits high and made of really strong reed and all."
Ezekiel,41,9,"The outside wall was pretty thick, like five cubits thick. And the remaining space inside was where the side chambers were located."
Ezekiel,41,10,And there was a space of twenty cubits between the rooms all around the house.
Ezekiel,41,11,"The doors of the side rooms were on the left side, with one door facing north and another facing south. The space left in between was about five cubits wide all around."
Ezekiel,41,12,"So, like, the building in front of the separate area at the far end toward the west was, like, 70 cubits wide. And the wall of the building was, like, 5 cubits thick all around, and it was, like, 90 cubits long."
Ezekiel,41,13,"So, he like measured the house, which was legit a hundred cubits long; and also this other area, and the building with its walls, both of them being a hundred cubits long;"
Ezekiel,41,14,"Like, the width of the front of the house and the area in front of it towards the east was, like, a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,41,15,"So, like, he measured the length of the building that was in the back, you know, with the cool walkways and stuff. These walkways were like a hundred cubits long and were connected to the inner temple and courtyards. The walkways were totally fancy, with pillars and all."
Ezekiel,41,16,"The door frames, small windows, and three-level balconies surrounding the door were all made of wood. The wooden ceilings reached from the ground up to the windows, which were covered."
Ezekiel,41,17,"From the ceiling all the way to the inside of the house, and even outside, spanning the entire perimeter inside and outside, it was all perfectly measured."
Ezekiel,41,18,"And they added some cool cherubims and palm trees to spice things up, so you got a palm tree chillin' between two cherubs. Oh, and each cherub had two faces - talk about a double persona!"
Ezekiel,41,19,"So, like, there was this cool setup where the faces of dudes were chilling towards one side of the palm tree, and the faces of young lions were posted up towards the other side. This whole vibe was on display throughout the entire house, you know? Super rad!"
Ezekiel,41,20,"There were these dope cherubims and palm trees crafted from ground up to above the door, and they were also engraved on the temple wall."
Ezekiel,41,21,The temple had square posts and a sanctuary with a matching look. They both had the same appearance.
Ezekiel,41,22,"The wooden altar was like three cubits tall and about two cubits long. It had wooden corners, walls, and stuff. Then he was like, 'Yo, listen up, this here table is for the LORD.'"
Ezekiel,41,23,"So, like, the temple and the sanctuary had these two sick doors, you know?"
Ezekiel,41,24,"And like, these doors had two leaves on each side you know, like two turning leaves, so like each door had two leaves on its side, you know, one door had two leaves and the other door also had two leaves."
Ezekiel,41,25,"And they put cherubims and palm trees on the doors of the temple, just like they did on the walls. The porch had heavy planks on the outside."
Ezekiel,41,26,"There were these cool small windows and some palm trees on one side, and on the other side, there were these sick porches with chambers and strong walls."
Ezekiel,42,1,"So, he took me to this area called the utter court, heading north. And then he led me to this chamber across from the separate place, in front of the building on the northern side."
Ezekiel,42,2,The north door used to be 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide.
Ezekiel,42,3,"In front of the twenty meters that belonged to the inner court, and in front of the cool flooring designated for the outer court, there were multiple levels of walkways aligned with each other."
Ezekiel,42,4,"There was this chill hallway leading to the rooms, about 10 cubits wide, going in about 1 cubit deep. And the doors were facing the north, you know."
Ezekiel,42,5,"So, like, the upper rooms were, like, shorter than the galleries, you know? The galleries were, like, taller than the lower rooms and the middle section of the building. And, like, the lower rooms and the middle section were, you know, part of the whole building vibe."
Ezekiel,42,6,"Like, there were three levels, but no pillars like the pillars in the courtyards, so the building was kinda squeezed, compared to the bottom and middle floors on the ground."
Ezekiel,42,7,"And the wall that was outside, facing the rooms, towards the open area in front of the rooms, its length was fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,8,"The rooms in the outer courtyard were fifty cubits long, and guess what? In front of the temple, there were a hundred cubits of space."
Ezekiel,42,9,"And the entrance on the east side is situated beneath these chambers, it's the way you go into them from the outer court. It's like where the person who brought me in came from."
Ezekiel,42,10,"The rooms were built in the thick part of the court wall, facing the east, right opposite the special area and the main building."
Ezekiel,42,11,"And the pathway in front of them looked similar to the cool rooms on the north side, as long and wide as they were. And all their entrances matched their unique styles and designs."
Ezekiel,42,12,"And there was a door at the front of the hallway, facing south, leading directly to the wall on the east side. This was the entrance to the chambers."
Ezekiel,42,13,"So he told me, the chambers to the north and south, in front of the special area, they are sacred rooms where the priests who come close to the LORD will eat the most sacred things. There they will place the most sacred things, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; because that place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests step inside, they can't just leave the sacred {place} and go into the main courtyard. They gotta leave their work clothes there 'cause they're super holy, and then put on different clothes before going near the things meant for the people."
Ezekiel,42,15,"So once he finished measuring the inner crib, he took me to the rad gate facing east and checked out its dimensions from every angle."
Ezekiel,42,16,"He used a measuring reed to measure the east side, which was 500 reeds all around. (Side note: Reed is Hebrew for 'wind')"
Ezekiel,42,17,"He checked out the north side, like 500 reeds or whatever, using the measuring reed all around."
Ezekiel,42,18,"He used his measuring stick to measure the southern side, and it was, like, 500 reeds long."
Ezekiel,42,19,"He turned around to the west, and used a measuring device to measure five hundred reeds."
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it on all four sides: the wall was all around, five hundred {reeds} long and five hundred wide, to create a division between the sacred area and the ordinary space."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Then he took me to this super cool gate, you know, the one that faces the east and stuff:"
Ezekiel,43,2,"Yo, check it out! The epicness of the God of Israel appeared, coming from the east side. His voice was like the sound of countless crashing waves, and the whole earth glowed with His magnificent glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"So, like, the vision I saw was just how I imagined it, you know? It was exactly like the vision I had when I first came to ruin the city. It had the same vibe as the vision I had by the river Chebar. I was so overwhelmed by it, I just fell flat on my face, man."
Ezekiel,43,4,And God's epic lightshow entered the crib through the entrance that faces the sunrise.
Ezekiel,43,5,"Bruh, the spirit straight up yeeted me into the inner court and, check it, the whole crib was lit up with the glory of the LORD."
Ezekiel,43,6,"So there I was, just chillin' in the house, when I suddenly heard this voice talkin' to me. And then, this dude shows up and stands next to me."
Ezekiel,43,7,"And he was like, 'Yo dude, listen up, I'm gonna tell you something important. The spot where I'm gonna kick it, and where I'm gonna chill with the Israel peeps forever, it's gonna be super sacred. The house of Israel better not disrespect it by doin' sketchy stuff, and their kings better not mess it up with their messed up ways and dead bodies in their fancy spots.'"
Ezekiel,43,8,"They totally disrespected my personal space and boundaries, setting up their own stuff right next to mine. The worst part is, they went ahead and tarnished my sacred name by doing all sorts of disgusting things. It made me so mad that I had to punish them big time!"
Ezekiel,43,9,"Alright, they better cut out their promiscuous behavior and ditch the dead bodies of their rulers, like really far away from me. And if they do, I'll totally chill with them forever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"Yo, dude, take the house and show it to the peeps of Israel so they can feel ashamed about all the messed up stuff they've been doing. And also, let them check out the cool blueprint or design or whatever."
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they feel embarrassed about everything they've done, show them a virtual tour of the house, with the layout, entrances, exits, and all the details, along with the rules and laws. Write it all out in front of them so they can understand and follow every aspect of it."
Ezekiel,43,12,"Yo, listen up! This here's the deal: The rules for the crib are that the highest point of the mountain is super sacred, like, all around it. No joke, this is how it goes down in the crib."
Ezekiel,43,13,"And these measurements of the altar are as follows: The measurement itself is a cubit and a handbreadth; the bottom will be a cubit, and the width a cubit, with a border around it measuring a span. This is the elevated part of the altar."
Ezekiel,43,14,"And from the floor to the lower bench will be two cubits in height, and one cubit in width; and from the smaller bench to the bigger bench will be four cubits in length, and one cubit in width."
Ezekiel,43,15,"The altar should be four cubits tall, and it should have four horns sticking out from the top. The altar is like a mountain of God, strong and mighty like a lion!"
Ezekiel,43,16,"And the altar will be, like, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide, all, like, squared off on each side."
Ezekiel,43,17,"The couch will be 14 cubits long and 14 cubits wide, making a perfect square. It will have a border that's half a cubit wide, and the bottom will measure one cubit all around. The stairs will face east."
Ezekiel,43,18,"And he was like, yo, Son of man, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD is saying: These are the rules for the altar when they're setting it up to make burnt offerings and sprinkle blood on it."
Ezekiel,43,19,"Yo, make sure you hook up those OG priests, the Levites from the Zadok fam, who stay close to me and serve me, says the Lord GOD. They deserve a fresh young bullock as a offering for their sins."
Ezekiel,43,20,And you gotta take some of the blood and dab it on the four horns and the four corners of the thing and all around the edges. That's how you make it all clean and fresh again.
Ezekiel,43,21,"Yo, you gotta grab that sin offering bull and burn it up in the designated spot outside the sanctuary crib."
Ezekiel,43,22,"On the second day, you gotta bring a flawless goat to make up for sins. Then they gotta clean the altar, just like when they cleaned it with a bull."
Ezekiel,43,23,"Once you're done cleaning {it}, you gotta bring in a flawless young bull and a spotless ram from the flock to offer as sacrifices."
Ezekiel,43,24,"And you gotta present them to the LORD, and the priests will sprinkle some salt on 'em, and then they'll offer them as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezekiel,43,25,"Yo, for a whole week, you gotta hook it up with a goat every single day as a sin offering. And check it, they gotta get a fresh young bullock and a flawless ram from the flock too."
Ezekiel,43,26,"For a whole week, they'll clean and make the altar pure, and they'll set themselves apart. {set themselves apart...: Hebrew: fill their hands}"
Ezekiel,43,27,"Once these days are over, on the eighth day and onwards, the priests will be in charge of offering your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar. And I, the Lord GOD, will gladly accept you."
Ezekiel,44,1,"So, he took me back to the gate of the sanctuary that faces east, and it was totally closed off, dude."
Ezekiel,44,2,"So, like, the LORD was all like, 'Yo, listen up! This gate is gonna be sealed tight, no way it's gonna open. No one's gonna be able to enter through it, got it? And you know why? It's 'cause the LORD, the God of Israel, has already entered through it, so it's gonna stay closed.'"
Ezekiel,44,3,"Dude, this spot is reserved for the boss; the boss is gonna chill here munching on some bread right in front of the LORD. He's gotta come in through the porch of that gate and leave the same way."
Ezekiel,44,4,"So he showed me the path to the north gate in front of the house. And I checked it out, and wow, God's amazingness totally filled the whole house of the LORD. It was so awe-inspiring that I couldn't even handle it and fell flat on my face."
Ezekiel,44,5,"Yo, dude, listen up! The Big Man upstairs told me, 'Hey, son of man, pay close attention and take in everything I'm about to tell you regarding all the rules and regulations of the LORD's crib, along with all its laws. And don't forget to take note of the entrance and exits of the sanctuary.'"
Ezekiel,44,6,"Listen up, rebellious peeps of Israel! The Lord GOD has a message for you: Yo, Israel, enough with all your messed up stuff!"
Ezekiel,44,7,"Dude, you brought in random people who don't even care about me or follow my ways into my special place? They're not even down with the whole circumcision thing, both physically and in their hearts. And now they're defiling my sanctuary, even my home, while you're trying to offer up my holy bread, fat, and blood. They straight-up violated our agreement because of all the messed up stuff you've been doing. Seriously, these people aren't even part of our crew."
Ezekiel,44,8,"And y'all haven't been takin' care of my sacred things: instead, you appointed yourselves as watchmen over my sacred responsibilities in my sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,9,"The Lord GOD says: No outsider, with a closed-off heart or body, can come into my sacred place, not even if they're hanging with the children of Israel."
Ezekiel,44,10,"So, there were these Levites who totally bailed on me when Israel got all off track and started worshipping their idols. Guess what? They're gonna have to take responsibility for their own wrongdoing."
Ezekiel,44,11,"But wait, they're gonna be like the cool squad in my holy place, holding it down at the entrance of the crib, and doing all the behind-the-scenes work for the crib: they'll handle those burnt offerings and sacrifices on behalf of the people, and they'll be right there ready to serve them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"Yo, 'cause they were all up in serving those idols, leading the people of Israel down a sinful path, I had to take action, no cap. The Lord GOD raised His hand against them. They gonna pay for their wrongdoings, straight up."
Ezekiel,44,13,"And they definitely can't come anywhere near me to do that priest stuff or get close to any of my sacred things in the super sacred place. Nope, not happening. Instead, they gotta carry the weight of their embarrassment and all the disgusting things they've done."
Ezekiel,44,14,"But like, I'm gonna appoint them to be in charge of taking care of the house and handling all the stuff that needs to be done there."
Ezekiel,44,15,"Yo, so these Levite priests, specifically the sons of Zadok, who stayed loyal to taking care of my sacred place when the Israelites started wanderin' away from me, they're the ones who can come close and serve me. They'll be right up in my presence to offer up the juicy stuff - the fat and the blood, you feel me? That's what the Lord GOD says, fam."
Ezekiel,44,16,"They'll come into my sacred space and get close to my table, serving me with their duties and keeping my commands."
Ezekiel,44,17,"When they walk into the inner court, they gotta wear linen clothes and no wool is allowed. This rule applies when they're doing their duties at the gates of the inner court and inside it."
Ezekiel,44,18,"They gotta wear cool linen bonnets on their heads, and rock comfy linen breeches on their waist; they can't be wearing anything that makes 'em sweat. No sweaty vibes, man."
Ezekiel,44,19,"And when they head out to the main area where the people are, they have to take off their work clothes and leave them in the special rooms, and then put on different clothes. They're not supposed to make the people holy with their clothes."
Ezekiel,44,20,They can't shave their heads but they also can't let their hair grow really long; they can only trim their hair.
Ezekiel,44,21,Priests can't have any wine when they step into the inner court.
Ezekiel,44,22,"They shouldn't marry widows or divorced women. Instead, they should choose young women who are descendants of the house of Israel, or widows who were previously married to priests."
Ezekiel,44,23,"And they gonna educate my peeps on what's holy and not cool, and help 'em tell apart the dirty from the fresh."
Ezekiel,44,24,"And when there's a conflict, they'll settle it in court; they'll make fair decisions based on my rules. They'll respect and follow my laws and regulations whenever we gather. And they'll honor and set apart my special days of rest."
Ezekiel,44,25,"They can't go near any dead person to make themselves impure, unless it's their dad, mom, son, daughter, brother, or sister who didn't have a husband. Then it's fine to make themselves impure."
Ezekiel,44,26,"Yo, once he's all purified, they gotta give him seven whole days."
Ezekiel,44,27,"And when he goes into the holy place, to the chill inner court, to do his thing in there, he's gotta present his sin offering, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,28,"And it's gonna be like, their full-on inheritance, you know? Like, they're totally gonna have me as their inheritance. And just so you know, they won't be getting any land or property in Israel, 'cause I'm their ultimate possession."
Ezekiel,44,29,"They'll munch on the meaty offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; anything set apart for the LORD in Israel will totally be theirs. {dedicated: or, devoted}"
Ezekiel,44,30,"The priest gets the top-notch stuff, the first and the best of everything you offer. And hey, don't forget to give him a piece of that fresh dough, because that'll bring some serious blessings to your crib. No doubt about it!"
Ezekiel,44,31,"The priests can't chow down on anything that died on its own or got torn up, whether it's a bird or an animal."
Ezekiel,45,1,"Yo, when you're divvying up the land for inheritance, make sure to give an offering to the LORD, a special piece of the land that's dedicated to Him. It's gotta be 25,000 reeds long and 10,000 reeds wide. That whole area has gotta be hella sacred, all around the borders and stuff, ya feel me?"
Ezekiel,45,2,"Yo, the sanctuary gonna be lit, bruh. It's gonna be five hundred long and five hundred wide, square all around. Plus, there's gonna be fifty cubits of space for the suburbs, you know, like chill hangout spots and stuff."
Ezekiel,45,3,"So, like, measure the length of this area to be like 25,000 units and the width to be 10,000 units. And inside, there will be the holy sanctuary and the super holy place."
Ezekiel,45,4,The sacred part of the land is reserved for the priests who serve in the sanctuary and worship the LORD. It's gonna be where they live and a holy area for the sanctuary.
Ezekiel,45,5,"And the area will be twenty-five thousand long and ten thousand wide. This space will be given to the Levites, who serve in the house, as their possession. They will have twenty rooms for themselves."
Ezekiel,45,6,"And you gotta reserve a city that's like 5000 wide and 25000 long, right across from the holy part. It's gonna be for all the people of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,7,"And there will be a part for the prince on both sides of the holy area and the city's property. It will be located in front of the holy area and the city's property, extending from the west side to the east side. The length will be opposite one of the sections, from the west border to the east border."
Ezekiel,45,8,"So basically, here's the deal: Israel, you get to keep your land. And listen up, my rulers, you better not mess with my people anymore. The rest of the land? Yeah, that's going to the different tribes of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,9,"Here's the deal, peeps in charge of Israel! God is like, 'Enough is enough! Cut out the violence and looting, and start doing what's fair and just. Quit exploiting my people,' says God."
Ezekiel,45,10,"Make sure your scales, measurements, and volumes are fair and honest."
Ezekiel,45,11,"The ephah and the bath gotta be the same size, so the bath can hold one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah can hold one-tenth of a homer too. The whole measurement thing is based on the homer."
Ezekiel,45,12,"And the currency will be in units called shekels, with each shekel equaling twenty gerahs. You can have twenty shekels, or even five and twenty shekels, or fifteen shekels, and that will make up your maneh."
Ezekiel,45,13,"Yo, this is the offering you gotta bring: like a sixth of a basket full of wheat, and another sixth of a basket full of barley."
Ezekiel,45,14,"So, when it comes to using oil, take one-tenth of a bath from every ten baths. That one-tenth comes from a cor, which is equal to ten baths. And just to be clear, ten baths equals one homer."
Ezekiel,45,15,"And like, there's this one lamb, you know, from this huge flock of like two hundred, all well-fed and stuff, from the lush pastures of Israel. So, this lamb is all extra and it's gonna be used for like a food offering, a burnt offering, and some peace offerings to, you know, reconcile with the Lord God. He's like, totally saying it, okay? {lamb: or, kid} {peace...: or, thank offerings}"
Ezekiel,45,16,Everyone in the land must contribute to this offering for the leader in Israel. #sharingiscaring
Ezekiel,45,17,"And it's the prince's job to bring burnt offerings, food offerings, and drink offerings during the feasts, new moons, and sabbaths, as well as all the special events in Israel. He's in charge of preparing the sin offering, food offering, burnt offering, and peace offerings to make things right for the people of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,18,"Yo, God's like, listen up fam: On the first month, first day of the month, you gotta grab a prime, flawless young bullock and purify the sanctuary, straight up."
Ezekiel,45,19,"Then the priest takes some of the blood from the sin offering and puts it on the sides of the house, the corners of the altar, and the sides of the gate in the inner court."
Ezekiel,45,20,"And like, on the seventh day of each month, you gotta have this whole thing going on. It's for everyone who messes up sometimes, you know? Also, the ones who are just kinda easygoing and naive. It's all about making things right in the crib, you feel me?"
Ezekiel,45,21,"On the first month, on the fourteenth day, you gotta celebrate Passover for a whole seven days. Only eat that unleavened bread, okay?"
Ezekiel,45,22,"And on that day, the prince gonna get himself and all the peeps in the land a big ol' bullock as an offering to make up for their sins."
Ezekiel,45,23,"During the whole week of the celebration, they gotta get their offering game on for the LORD. Each day for seven days, they gotta bring seven flawless bulls and seven unblemished rams as burnt sacrifices. And you know what's up? They also gotta bring a little goat every day as a sin offering. It's all about showing that respect to the big man up above."
Ezekiel,45,24,"And he's gonna whip up a feast with a whole bowl of flour for a bull, another bowl for a ram, and about a quart of oil for each bowl."
Ezekiel,45,25,"On the seventh month, specifically on the fifteenth day, they gotta do the same thing they do during the seven-day feast. You know, all that sin offering, burnt offering, meat offering, and oil stuff."
Ezekiel,46,1,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD says: The entrance to the inner court that faces east will be closed for six days of the week, but it's gonna swing wide open on the Sabbath and on the day of the new moon. No cap."
Ezekiel,46,2,"And the prince will come through the entrance of that gate, and will stand by the side of the gate. The priests will get ready his burnt offering and peace offerings, and he will worship at the entrance of the gate. After that, he will leave, but the gate will remain open until the evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,"And yo, the peeps of the land gonna worship right at the entrance of this gate, showin' mad respect to the LORD on the sabbaths and new moons."
Ezekiel,46,4,"On the Sabbath day, the prince gotta bring six flawless lambs and a flawless ram as a burnt offering to the Lord."
Ezekiel,46,5,"For the ram, the meat offering should be a generous portion, and for the lambs, the offering should be according to what he can afford. Additionally, there should be an abundance of oil - a whole hin's worth for the offering."
Ezekiel,46,6,"On the day of the fresh start, you gotta bring a flawless young bullock, six lambs, and a ram. All of them must be perfect without any flaws."
Ezekiel,46,7,"And he's gotta make a lit food offering, like an ephah size for the bull, and another ephah size for the ram, and for the baby lambs it depends on how much he can handle, plus a hin of oil for an ephah size measurement."
Ezekiel,46,8,"And when the cool VIP arrives, they'll enter through the porch of that lit gate, and they'll bounce out the same way."
Ezekiel,46,9,"But yo, when the folks gather to worship the LORD during the lit feasts, whoever enters through the north gate gotta exit through the south gate, and whoever enters through the south gate gotta bounce through the north gate, ya feel? No doubling back through the same gate, but you gotta dip through the opposite one, straight up."
Ezekiel,46,10,"And the leader, yo, right in the middle, when they enter, gonna enter; and when they leave, gonna leave."
Ezekiel,46,11,"During the feasts and special events, the offering of food should be just right - enough to satisfy a bullock, a ram, and however many lambs are offered, along with a good measure of oil."
Ezekiel,46,12,"So, when the boss wants to make a chill offering or peace offering to the big man upstairs, someone should open the gate facing east for him. He can then do his thing with the burnt offering and peace offerings, just like on Sabbath. Once he's finished, he can dip and then someone can close the gate."
Ezekiel,46,13,Make sure to offer a fresh and perfect one-year-old lamb as a burnt sacrifice to the LORD every single day. Do this every morning like clockwork.
Ezekiel,46,14,"And you gotta whip up a bomb snack every morning - it's gotta be like a sixth of a crazy amount of flour and a third of a wicked amount of oil, to mix in with the fine flour. This snack offering is gonna be on the menu 24/7, forever, like a sacred tradition for the Big Boss upstairs, yo."
Ezekiel,46,15,"So, like, they gotta get the lamb, the meat, and the oil ready every morning for, like, an ongoing burnt offering."
Ezekiel,46,16,"Yo, listen up! This is what the Lord GOD is sayin': If a prince gives a gift to one of his sons, that gift is gonna belong to his sons. They're gonna have it as their own, it's their inheritance, ya feel?"
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he decides to give part of his inheritance to one of his servants, that servant gets to keep it until the year of freedom. After that, it goes back to the prince, but his actual inheritance belongs to his sons from then on."
Ezekiel,46,18,"Also, the ruler can't unfairly take away the people's land and force them to leave. Instead, he should give his own children land from his own property. This way, my people won't be scattered and lose their inherited land."
Ezekiel,46,19,"So, like, he took me through this entryway, you know, next to the gate, and we ended up in the holy chambers of the priests. And get this, those chambers were facing towards the north, and lo and behold, there was this area on both sides towards the west!"
Ezekiel,46,20,"So basically, he told me that this is the spot where the priests are gonna boil the trespass offering and the sin offering. They're also gonna bake the meat offering here, instead of taking it outside to the courtyard, to keep the people all holy and stuff."
Ezekiel,46,21,"So he took me out into the main area, and made me go around to each of the four corners of the space. And guess what? In every single corner, there was another smaller area. It was like a mini court within a court, and it was happening in every corner!"
Ezekiel,46,22,"In the four corners of the court, there were connected courts that measured 40 cubits in length and 30 cubits in width. These four corners were all the same size, like totally consistent."
Ezekiel,46,23,"There were actually these chill buildings all around, like four of them, complete with lit spots underneath for cooking."
Ezekiel,46,24,"So, like, he was all, 'Yo, check this out, these are the spots where they do the boiling, you know? That's where the crew in the house works their magic and boils the sacrifice from the people.'"
Ezekiel,47,1,"Then he took me back to the entrance of the house and, like, check this out, water started flowing out from under the doorstep of the house towards the east. The house was facing east and the water came out from under the right side of the house, right by the south side of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,"So he took me away from the northern gate and walked me around to the outer gate that faces east. And oh, guess what? Water gushed out on the right side!"
Ezekiel,47,3,"So, the dude with the measuring tape started walking towards the east. He measured a thousand cubits and led me through the water. The water was only up to our ankles."
Ezekiel,47,4,"Bruh, he measured another thousand and took me through these waters. The water was up to my knees, man. Then he measured another thousand and took me through again, and now the water was up to my waist."
Ezekiel,47,5,"Then he measured another thousand; and there was this mega river that was impossible to cross because it was flooding with waters, like a totally epic swimming pool that you couldn't just pass over. It was seriously non-passable, dude! The kind of waters you swim in, you know what I mean? (btw, the Hebrew says 'waters of swimming')"
Ezekiel,47,6,"And he was like, yo dude, did you check this out? And then he like, took me and brought me back to the edge of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"So, when I got back, yo, I saw a whole bunch of trees lined up by the river, on both sides. It was lit, tbh. (btw, 'bank' means 'lip' in Hebrew)"
Ezekiel,47,8,"And he said to me, Yo, check it, these waters flow east towards the country, then they hit up the desert, and finally make their way into the sea. Once they chill in the sea, they bring healing vibes to the waters. It's like a total transformation, no cap. (P.S. desert can also mean a plain, just so you know)"
Ezekiel,47,9,"And it's gonna happen, like, everything that's alive and moving, wherever the rivers flow, is gonna come alive. There's gonna be a crazy huge amount of fish, 'cause these waters will flow there and make 'em all better. Everything's gonna be alive wherever this river goes. (rivers: Hebrew for two rivers)"
Ezekiel,47,10,"Yo, like, imagine this: there are gonna be a bunch of fishers posted up all along this stretch from Engedi to Eneglaim. It's gonna be the perfect spot to cast their nets, and they're gonna reel in all sorts of fish, just like what you find in the huge ocean, like, so many, it's unreal."
Ezekiel,47,11,But the gross and swampy areas won't be fixed; they'll just turn into salty wastelands.
Ezekiel,47,12,"And next to the river, on both sides, there will be all kinds of trees that provide food. Their leaves will never wither, and their fruit will constantly replenish. This is because their water comes from a holy place, and the fruit is not only for eating, but the leaves have healing properties for bruises and sores."
Ezekiel,47,13,"God said, 'Listen up, guys! This is gonna be the legit border for you to inherit the land, divided into twelve tribes of Israel. But check it, Joseph's gonna score not one, but two sweet portions.'"
Ezekiel,47,14,"And you all are gonna get this land as your inheritance, together, hand in hand. I promised your ancestors that I would give it to them, and now it's gonna be yours. It's like a total gift just for you. No doubt, this land is yours to keep!"
Ezekiel,47,15,"This right here is gonna be the boundary of the land to the north, starting from the big ocean and going through Hethlon, all the way to Zedad, the usual route people take."
Ezekiel,47,16,"Bro, check it out - we got Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, like, in that spot between Damascus and Hamath's border. And oh, by the way, there's Hazarhatticon too, close to the coast of Hauran. You know, that middle village and all."
Ezekiel,47,17,"And the line that marks the boundary from the sea will go to Hazarenan, then to the outskirts of Damascus, and further north, all the way to Hamath. And let me tell you, this is the northern side we're talking about."
Ezekiel,47,18,"You gotta measure the east side from Hauran, Damascus, Gilead, and the land of Israel that's near the Jordan River, all the way to the east sea. Yup, that's the east side for ya!"
Ezekiel,47,19,"And the southern part continues down from Tamar to the conflict zone in Kadesh, where the river flows into the vast ocean. This is the southern boundary. (Conflict zone can also be called Meribah, and the river can also be referred to as a valley. The southern boundary can also be described as facing Teman.)"
Ezekiel,47,20,"On the west side, it's gonna be all about that big sea from the border all the way till a dude reaches Hamath. Yep, that's the west side."
Ezekiel,47,21,"Okay, fam, it's time to split up this land among the tribes of Israel."
Ezekiel,47,22,"And it's gonna happen, y'all gonna pick your shares by chance as your possession, and for the newbies chillin' with y'all, who'll have kids among y'all, they'll be just like natives among the Israelites; they'll get a share with y'all among the tribes of Israel."
Ezekiel,47,23,"And like, dude, wherever the stranger hangs out in a tribe, that's where you gotta hook him up with his inheritance, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,1,"So these are the names of the tribes. From the north end all the way to Hethlon along the road to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus going north to the coast of Hamath. This area is on both sides, east and west, and it's designated for Dan."
Ezekiel,48,2,"And, like, towards the border of Dan, starting from the east side all the way to the west side, yo, that's where Asher's getting their land and stuff."
Ezekiel,48,3,"And near the edge of Asher, from the sunrise all the way to the sunset, a part that belongs to Naphtali."
Ezekiel,48,4,"And like, on the edge of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, there's this whole region just for Manasseh, you know?"
Ezekiel,48,5,"And like, on the edge of Manasseh, from, like, the east side to the west side, there's, like, a dope piece of land for Ephraim."
Ezekiel,48,6,"And on the outskirts of Ephraim, covering the entire area from east to west, there shall be a designated spot for Reuben."
Ezekiel,48,7,"And like, Reuben's territory runs from, like, the east all the way to the west, and, like, there's this sick portion for Judah, you know?"
Ezekiel,48,8,"And along the border of Judah, from the east to the west, you shall offer an offering that measures 25,000 reeds wide and the same length as the other parts, from the east to the west. And the sanctuary shall be right in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,9,"The offering you gotta give to the LORD has gotta be hella big, like 25K long and 10K wide."
Ezekiel,48,10,"And for the priests too, there will be this super holy offering! It's like 25,000 in length toward the north, 10,000 in breadth toward the west and east, and another 25,000 in length toward the south. And the LORD's special place will be right in the middle!"
Ezekiel,48,11,"This is for the cool priests from the crew of Zadok. They stayed loyal and didn't get lost when all the Israelites were lost, just like the Levites. This special portion is theirs!"
Ezekiel,48,12,And this offering from the land that they receive shall be extremely sacred to the Levites at the edge of their territory.
Ezekiel,48,13,"And next to the area designated for the priests, the Levites shall have a space measuring twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width. The entire length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the width ten thousand."
Ezekiel,48,14,"And they can't sell any of it, or swap it, or give away the firstfruits of the land: 'cause it's totally sacred to the LORD."
Ezekiel,48,15,"And the remaining five thousand, which are opposite the twenty-five thousand, will be a regular spot for the city, for living, and for the surrounding areas. And the city will be right in the middle."
Ezekiel,48,16,"And here are the measurements: the north side is, like, four thousand and five hundred units, and the south side is four thousand and five hundred units, and the east side is four thousand and five hundred units, and the west side is also four thousand and five hundred units."
Ezekiel,48,17,"And the areas around the city will stretch to the north for a cool 250, and to the south for another 250, and to the east for a solid 250, and to the west for a dope 250."
Ezekiel,48,18,"And there will be a leftover area on each side of the sacred offering, stretching ten thousand units to the east and ten thousand units to the west. This area will be opposite the sacred offering and its produce will be used as food for those who serve the city."
Ezekiel,48,19,"And all the homies reppin' their tribes in Israel gonna serve the city together, no cap."
Ezekiel,48,20,"You gotta bring a total of 25,000 offerings that are each 25,000 wide, making them all perfectly square and dedicated to God. Don't forget, it's part of the city's sacred possessions!"
Ezekiel,48,21,"The leftover stuff is for the prince, on both sides of the sacred area and the city's land. It's opposite the 25,000 units of land on the east border, and also opposite the other 25,000 units on the west border. It's for the prince's portions and it's considered holy. The temple of the house will be right in the middle of it all."
Ezekiel,48,22,"Also, the Levites and the city's property, which is situated between Judah and Benjamin, will belong to the prince."
Ezekiel,48,23,"And concerning the remaining tribes, from the lit side to the flex side, Benjamin will secure some land. Like, it's gonna be his own piece, you know. Like, one geniune portion, ya feel?"
Ezekiel,48,24,"And like, by the edge of Benjamin, from the sunrise to the sunset, Simeon gets this totally rad piece of land."
Ezekiel,48,25,"And on the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, there was a piece of land given to Issachar."
Ezekiel,48,26,"And on the edge of Issachar, from the sunrise to the sunset, Zebulun got a piece."
Ezekiel,48,27,"And, like, on the border of Zebulun, from the east side all the way to the west side, Gad gets a chunk of land."
Ezekiel,48,28,"And, like, the border of Gad on the southern side will, like, start from Tamar and go all the way to the place where they had that big argument, you know, in Kadesh, and then continue to the river by the cool ocean. It's kinda like, intense, you know. #ConflictResolution"
Ezekiel,48,29,"Yo, this is the land that you guys gonna split up between the tribes of Israel as their inheritance, and these are gonna be their portions, says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,30,"So, like, here's the dealio, these are the boundaries of the city on the north side, and, get this, it's like, four thousand and five hundred measures long. Insane, right?"
Ezekiel,48,31,"And the coolio gates of the city gonna be named after the tribes of Israel, ya know? Three chill gates up north: a gate for Reuben, a gate for Judah, and a gate for Levi."
Ezekiel,48,32,"And on the east side there were 4,500 people, and three entrances; including a gate named after Joseph, another one after Benjamin, and one more after Dan."
Ezekiel,48,33,"And on the southern side, there were four thousand and five hundred measures and three gates. There was a cool gate for Simeon, a rad gate for Issachar, and a lit gate for Zebulun."
Ezekiel,48,34,"On the west side there were a total of 4,500 peeps, with three lit gates: one for Gad, one for Asher, and one for Naphtali."
Ezekiel,48,35,"It's like, the city is gonna have, like, 18,000 measures all around. And the name of the city from that day on is gonna be, like, The LORD is there. #Blessed #Jehovahshammah"
Daniel,1,1,"In the third year when Jehoiakim was king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, rolled up to Jerusalem and set up camp around it."
Daniel,1,2,"So, like, God totally let this dude named Jehoiakim, who was the king of Judah, get captured. And not only that, but he also allowed some of the holy stuff from the house of God to be taken away. This guy took the holy stuff and brought it to Shinar to place it in his own god's house. And yeah, he just stored those treasures in there."
Daniel,1,3,"So the king talked to Ashpenaz, the head of his servants, and told him to select some of the Israelite kids, as well as some from the royal family and the high-ranking officials."
Daniel,1,4,"These kids were flawless, good-looking, super smart, and knowledgeable in all subjects. They were total geniuses, experts in everything from science to linguistics. They were perfect candidates to be the king's right-hand people, ready to learn anything and everything about the Chaldeans."
Daniel,1,5,"The king hooked them up with his fancy food and drink every day for three years, to make sure they were well-fed and could impress the king later on."
Daniel,1,6,"So, like, among these group of peeps, there were four homies from the tribe of Judah named Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"
Daniel,1,7,"So the prince in charge of them picked new names for them: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego."
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel was like, 'Nah, I'm not about to ruin my vibes with that fancy food and wine from the king.' So, he asked the eunuch in charge if he could skip it and stay true to himself."
Daniel,1,9,"So, like, God totally made Daniel super popular and tight with the prince of the eunuchs. No cap!"
Daniel,1,10,"Yo, the manager dude said to Daniel: I'm low-key scared of the king, man. He's the one who decides what you eat and drink. Like, if he sees you looking all sad and down while the other kids your age are all hyped, I'm gonna be in major trouble with the king. Can't let that happen, bro."
Daniel,1,11,"So Daniel spoke to Melzar, the person in charge appointed by the prince of the eunuchs, who was responsible for Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, yo!"
Daniel,1,12,"Yo, hear me out, boss. How 'bout we put it to the test? Give your servants just ten days, and hook us up with some plant-based grub and H2O. You feel me?"
Daniel,1,13,"Yo, check out our faces and the faces of the homies who dig into the king's grub. Do what you gotta do, fam."
Daniel,1,14,"So he was like, 'Sure, I'm down with that,' and decided to test them for ten days."
Daniel,1,15,"After ten days, they looked way more awesome and totally had a glow-up compared to all the other kids who ate the fancy food from the king."
Daniel,1,16,"So Melzar took away their main dish and their fancy drinks, and gave them some simple plant-based food instead."
Daniel,1,17,"Yo, these four kids? God hooked them up with mad knowledge and skills in all kinds of learning and wisdom. And check it, Daniel was on another level, he understood all those crazy visions and dreams, man."
Daniel,1,18,"So, when the time was up and the king wanted them to come, the cool dude in charge of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"So, the king had a chat with them all, and out of everyone, he couldn't find anyone as awesome as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. That's why they totally scored a VIP spot in front of the king."
Daniel,1,20,"And like, in every aspect of being super smart and all, when the king asked them for advice, he discovered that they were, like, ten times better than all the magicians and fortune tellers in the whole kingdom. It was, like, their epic wisdom and deep understanding, you know!"
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel stayed around until the beginning of King Cyrus' reign.
Daniel,2,1,"So, like, in the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was like totally ruling the place, he had these crazy dreams that really messed with his head, like his spirit was all troubled and he couldn't even sleep properly."
Daniel,2,2,"So the king was like, 'Yo, bring all the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to me ASAP to interpret my dreams.' And they rolled up and stood before the king like champs."
Daniel,2,3,"So the king was like, 'Yo, listen up. I had this crazy dream and it's stressing me out, I need to know what it means'."
Daniel,2,4,"The Chaldeans were like, 'Sup, king? Live forever, dude! Share the dream with us and we'll help you understand its meaning.'"
Daniel,2,5,"The king was like, yo Chaldeans, I totally forgot what I dreamed about. If you don't spill the beans and tell me what it means, I'll make sure you're toast and your cribs become a dump. #brutal"
Daniel,2,6,"Hey, listen up! If you spill the tea on that dream and tell me what it means, I'll hook you up with some sick gifts, rewards, and major respect. So spill it, spill the tea on the dream and its interpretation. You won't regret it, fam. Trust!"
Daniel,2,7,"They were like, 'Dude, just spill the tea and tell us your dream, and we'll totally interpret it for you.'"
Daniel,2,8,"The king was like, 'I totally get it, you're just trying to buy more time cuz you see that everything's slipping away from me.'"
Daniel,2,9,"Listen up, if you don't spill the tea on the dream, there's only one outcome for y'all. Y'all straight up came here with fake and messed up words, trying to play me until things change. So spill the dream already, and then I'll know if you can actually explain what it means."
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans were like, 'Yo, king, no one on this planet can handle your case. Not a single king, lord, or ruler has ever asked the magicians, astrologers, or Chaldeans such a thing.'"
Daniel,2,11,"It's super uncommon for the king to ask for this, and no one else can do it except for the gods, who don't hang out with regular people."
Daniel,2,12,"Because of this, the king got totally ticked off and was mega angry, so he ordered to wipe out all the smart dudes in Babylon."
Daniel,2,13,"So basically, they made a rule that said all the smart dudes had to die. And guess what? Daniel and his crew were on the hit list too."
Daniel,2,14,"So Daniel came up with a really smart and wise response for Arioch, the leader of the king's guards, who was on a mission to kill all the intelligent folks in Babylon."
Daniel,2,15,"Yo, Daniel asked Arioch, the top dog of the king's crew, why the king's orders are coming in hot so suddenly? And Arioch spilled the deets to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,So Daniel slid into the king's DMs and asked for a timeout to come up with a sick explainer for the king.
Daniel,2,17,"So Daniel rolled up to his crib and spilled the tea to his homies Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his squad:"
Daniel,2,18,"You know how Daniel and his squad were about to get wrecked along with the other wise guys in Babylon? Well, they prayed to the God of heaven to drop some mercies on them and keep them safe from that fate. And it totally worked, thanks to the Big Man upstairs!"
Daniel,2,19,"Yo, so Daniel had this lit moment where he received a sick night vision and got all the deets on a secret. And guess what? Homie Daniel straight up blessed the God of heaven after that!"
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel was like, Praisee God's name forever and ever, yo! 'Cause he's got all the wisdom and power, straight up.'"
Daniel,2,21,"And like, God totally has the power to switch up the times and the vibes. He can totally take out rulers and put new ones in charge. He's all about blessing the smart ones with wisdom and hooking up the knowledgeable ones with knowledge, ya know?"
Daniel,2,22,"He spills the tea on all the hidden and undercover stuff: he knows what's lurking in the shadows, and he's all about that positive vibes."
Daniel,2,23,"Yo, big thank you and shoutout to you, the God of my fam, for hookin' me up with wisdom and strength. You came through and spilled the tea on what we were askin' for. You straight-up let us in on the king's business!"
Daniel,2,24,"So Daniel went to Arioch, who the king had put in charge of getting rid of the smart {people} in Babylon. He went up to him and said, 'Hey, please don't get rid of the smart {people} in Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I'll show him the interpretation.'"
Daniel,2,25,"So, like, Arioch was like super urgent and brought Daniel before the king, and he was all like, 'Yo, dude, I found this guy from the Judah crew who can totally interpret stuff for ya and spill the tea on it, you know?'"
Daniel,2,26,"The king was like, 'Yo, Daniel, aka Belteshazzar, do you think you can spill the tea and tell me what my dream was about and what it means?"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel straight up told the king, like, none of those supposed wise guys - the astrologers, magicians, and fortune tellers - can spill the secret that the king wants to know."
Daniel,2,28,"But yo, yo, there's a Supreme Being up in the heavens who's all about spilling the tea on secrets and letting King Nebuchadnezzar know what's gonna go down in the future. So check it, that dream you had and those trippy visions in your head while you were chilling on your bed? Yeah, they're all connected. God's been straight-up revealing it all, ya know?"
Daniel,2,29,"Yo, king, while you were chilling on your bed, you started thinking about what's gonna happen in the future. And guess what? The one who spills the tea on secrets is gonna let you in on what's up ahead."
Daniel,2,30,"But yo, just so you know, this secret I got? It ain't 'cause I'm some genius or better than anyone else. It's actually for those people who will explain the meaning to the king, ya feel me? And also so you can understand what's really going on in your heart, straight up."
Daniel,2,31,"Yo, king, you peeped this sick vision. It was all about this dope image, shining like crazy, chilling right in front of you. But yo, this image was straight up intimidating."
Daniel,2,32,"This statue had a sick head made of top-tier gold, its chest and arms were hella shiny silver, and its stomach and legs were all about that brass life, you know? Like, the thighs were so lit, or they could also be called the sides, if you're into that 411."
Daniel,2,33,"Yo, this dude got legs of pure iron and his feet are like a mix of iron and clay."
Daniel,2,34,"So like, you were watching, right? And you saw this stone that was, like, magically formed without being made by human hands. And dude, this stone totally smashed the statue's feet, which were made of iron and clay, and broke them into a million pieces. It was, like, epic! (Not gonna lie, that stone was definitely not something you would find in anybody's hands.)"
Daniel,2,35,"So, like, the iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold all got totally wrecked and turned into worthless dust, just like the chaff from those summer threshingfloors. The wind blew them away and there was literally no trace of them left. But then this stone came out of nowhere and smashed the whole image, becoming this massive mountain that covered the entire earth. Crazy, right?"
Daniel,2,36,"So, here's the deal: this is the dream we got, and we're about to spill the tea and explain it to the king."
Daniel,2,37,"Yo, king, you're like the ultimate king of all kings: 'cause the boss up in heaven hooked you up with a sick kingdom, mad power, strength, and major glory."
Daniel,2,38,"Like, wherever humans live, you've totally been given control over all the animals on the ground and birds in the sky. You're like the ultimate ruler over all of them. And dude, you're the head of gold, seriously!"
Daniel,2,39,"And then there's gonna be another kingdom, like, not as strong as yours, and then a third kingdom made of brass that's gonna have total domination over the whole earth."
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom is gonna be, like, super strong, you know? It's like, iron, because iron can totally break stuff and conquer everything. Just like iron breaking things, this kingdom is gonna break stuff too and, like, dominate everything."
Daniel,2,41,"So, like, I know you saw those feet and toes, right? Some made of clay from the pottery peeps and others made of iron. Well, here's the scoop: the kingdom is gonna get divided, but there's gonna be some serious strength in it, 'cause you saw that iron mixed in with the muddy clay."
Daniel,2,42,"So, like, the toes on the feet were, like, some were made of iron and some were made of clay, right? And that's how the kingdom will be – kinda strong but kinda fragile, you know? Like, partially strong and partially, like, breakable. (or, if you prefer, like, brittle)"
Daniel,2,43,"And, like, you know when you saw that iron mixed with like muddy clay stuff? Well, those two things are gonna try to come together and mix with human beings. But, like, they won't fully stick together, you know? It's kinda like how iron and clay don't really mix well. So, yeah."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days when these kings are ruling, the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed. This kingdom will not be given to other people, but it will crush and overcome all these kingdoms, and it will endure forever. (the days: in their time) (the kingdom: its own kingdom)"
Daniel,2,45,"So, like, you saw that the stone was like, cut from the mountain without any human hands and it totally crushed the iron, brass, clay, silver, and gold. Bro, the mighty God has straight up revealed to the king what's about to go down in the future, and trust me, the dream is totally legit and the interpretation is solid."
Daniel,2,46,"So, like, King Nebuchadnezzar totally prostrated himself before Daniel and worshipped him, and then he was all like, 'Yo, y'all gotta make offerings and burn some nice-smelling stuff for him.'"
Daniel,2,47,"The king responded to Daniel and was like, 'Dude, for real, your God is like the ultimate God, way above all other gods, and He's also the boss of all kings and can totally uncover hidden stuff. You really showed your skills by revealing this secret.'"
Daniel,2,48,"So, like, the king totally boosted Daniel's status and showered him with mad gifts. He even promoted him to be the boss of the whole Babylon province and the head honcho of all the smart peeps in Babylon."
Daniel,2,49,"So Daniel asked the king and he made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the province of Babylon. But Daniel, he was posted at the king's gate."
Daniel,3,1,"So King Nebuchadnezzar flexed by making a massive gold statue, towering sixty cubits high and six cubits wide. He planted it in the open field of Dura, located in the Babylon province."
Daniel,3,2,"So, King Nebuchadnezzar was like, 'Yo, let's get all the big shots - the princes, the governors, the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces - to come to the big event where we dedicate this image that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have just put up.'"
Daniel,3,3,"So, like, all the big shots - the princes, governors, captains, judges, treasurers, advisors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces - they all got together for this epic event, the dedication of this huge image that King Nebuchadnezzar had put up. And of course, they all stood in awe before the mighty image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"And then this really loud guy shouted out, like seriously loud, yo listen up, all you peeps from every corner of the world, I'm talkin' to you, all you different cultures and languages, so check this out, the big shots are sayin'..."
Daniel,3,5,"When you hear the sick beats of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer blasting in your ears, you gotta drop everything and pay homage to the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar set up. (By the way, dulcimer is like singing or a funky symphony in Chaldee)"
Daniel,3,6,"And if anyone doesn't bow down and worship, they'll be thrown into a super hot furnace right away."
Daniel,3,7,"So like, when everyone heard the sick beats of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and other dope music, all the people from different nations and languages straight up fell down and worshipped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had put up, no cap."
Daniel,3,8,"So like, back in the day, these Chaldeans showed up and started throwing shade at the Jews."
Daniel,3,9,"They were like, 'Yo, King Nebuchadnezzar, may you live forever!'"
Daniel,3,10,"Yo, king, you've made a rule that anyone who hears the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, or any kinda music has to bow down and worship the golden image. (BTW, dulcimer could also mean singing, or symphony in Chaldee)"
Daniel,3,11,"And if anyone refuses to bow down and worship, they will be thrown into, like, a super intense fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,12,"Yo, there's these Jewish dudes who you put in charge of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They straight up don't care about you, King. They refuse to worship your gods or bow down to that golden statue you made."
Daniel,3,13,"So, like, Nebuchadnezzar was totally furious, right? And he was all like, 'Yo, bring me Shad, Mesh, and Abed!' And bam, they brought those dudes straight to the king's crib."
Daniel,3,14,"So Nebuchadnezzar was like, 'Yo, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you guys won't bow down to my gods or worship the huge golden statue I made? Like, for real?'"
Daniel,3,15,"If you're down to vibe when you catch the sick beats of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all sorts of lit music, and you bow down to worship the image I created, then we're cool. But if you don't do that, FYI, you're getting tossed into a blazing furnace right away. And let me ask you, who do you think can save you from my grasp? (FYI, dulcimer can also mean singing: in Chaldee, symphony)"
Daniel,3,16,"Yo, Nebuchadnezzar, listen up! Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego ain't stressing about how to respond to you about this."
Daniel,3,17,"Like, if that's the case, our God, whom we're all about, can totally save us from getting roasted in that fiery furnace. And, like, He'll totally rescue us from your grip, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"Yo, listen up, King. Just so you know, we ain't gonna bow down to your gods or worship that flashy golden statue you put up."
Daniel,3,19,"Nebuchadnezzar got super mad and his face looked really angry at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So, he ordered his peeps to crank up the heat in the furnace seven times hotter than usual."
Daniel,3,20,"And he ordered the absolute chads in his squad to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and throw them into the flaming furnace. (These dudes were seriously strong, by the way.)"
Daniel,3,21,"So these guys were tied up in their trendy clothes, their sick kicks, their fresh caps, and their other dope threads, and they got yeeted into the blazing hot furnace. (FYI: 'coats' could also mean 'mantles' and 'hats' could mean 'turbans')."
Daniel,3,22,"So, like, because the king was all like super demanding and the furnace was like crazy hot, the fire totally roasted those dudes who tried to mess with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
Daniel,3,23,"So, these three dudes, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, totally got thrown into this super hot furnace, all tied up and stuff."
Daniel,3,24,"OMG, so Nebuchadnezzar, like the king, was totally shook! He quickly got up and was all like, 'Yo, did we not throw those three dudes into the fire, all tied up and stuff?' His advisors were like, 'Totally, King! That's true!'"
Daniel,3,25,"Yo, check it out, I was like, looking at this crazy scene and I saw these four dudes just chilling, not even stressing, walking right through a raging fire. And get this, they weren't even getting hurt! But here's the wildest part - the fourth guy, he straight up had the appearance of the Son of God. Can you believe it?!"
Daniel,3,26,"So Nebuchadnezzar went up to the entrance of the blazing furnace and called out, saying, 'Yo, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you guys who serve the Almighty God, come out here, like, right now!' And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire, no biggie."
Daniel,3,27,"So, like, all the important dudes - the princes, the governors, the captains, and the king's advisors - they all came together and noticed something super mind-blowing. These guys, who got thrown into this crazy fire, were totally untouched! Not a single strand of their hair was singed, their clothes were still on point, and they didn't even smell like fire. It was insane, man!"
Daniel,3,28,"So Nebuchadnezzar spoke up and was like, 'Yo, shoutout to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! Respect to Him for sending His angel and saving His loyal servants. These dudes straight up defied the king's orders and risked their lives to stay true to their own God and not worship any other god.'"
Daniel,3,29,"So, listen up everyone! I'm passing a decree that if anyone, from any place, chats nonsense or disrespects the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they're gonna face some serious consequences! Their lives will be shattered and their houses turned into dumps! Let me tell you, there's no other God who can rescue like this one can. Believe it or not, it's official!"
Daniel,3,30,"So like, the king totally recognized Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego for being awesome and gave them this major promotion in Babylon. It was like, their time to shine and show everyone how they could totally prosper in the kingdom. #Winning"
Daniel,4,1,"Yo, King Nebuchadnezzar here, shoutout to all y'all peeps, from every nation, vibin' in every corner of the earth. Sending mad love and wishing y'all peace multiplied."
Daniel,4,2,"I figured it'd be cool to share all the sick miracles and amazing things that the Almighty God has done for me. Like, seriously mind-blowing stuff, you know?"
Daniel,4,3,"Yo, his signs are straight up mind-blowing! And his wonders? They're absolutely next level! His kingdom? It's gonna last forever, no cap. And his power? It goes way back, from one generation to the next."
Daniel,4,4,"So like, Nebuchadnezzar was just chillin' at home, totally thriving in his huge crib:"
Daniel,4,5,"Yo, I had this crazy dream that had me shook! The stuff I was thinkin' about and the visuals in my head really messed with me."
Daniel,4,6,"So I was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna gather all the top brains in Babylon and have them spill the tea on the meaning of my dream.'"
Daniel,4,7,"So then these magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers showed up, and I totally spilled the tea on my dream to them. But yo, they couldn't even clue me in on what it meant."
Daniel,4,8,"So, finally, Daniel showed up. His real name was Belteshazzar, but like, he was all into his god and like, really in touch with some holy spirit stuff. Anyway, I spilled the beans about my dream to him, like this:"
Daniel,4,9,"Hey Belteshazzar, you're like, the ultimate magician, and I know you're totally connected with the divine vibes. So, spill it - tell me all about the visions in my dream and what they mean."
Daniel,4,10,"So, here's the deal, guys: I had this crazy dream while I was chilling in my bed. I saw this massive tree right smack in the middle of the earth, and let me tell you, it was seriously tall. Like, mind-blowingly tall. Can't even comprehend it, you know?"
Daniel,4,11,"Yo, that tree was straight up booming! It was hella strong, reaching to the sky and its massive size could be seen all the way across the globe!"
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves were looking totally amazing, and the fruit was abundant, like, seriously so much fruit! And it wasn't just for one person, it was enough to feed everybody. The wild animals found shade under it, and the birds made their homes in its branches. Basically, it provided food for all living things."
Daniel,4,13,"So, I'm lying in bed, just chilling and daydreaming, when suddenly I catch a vision. And yo, guess what? An angelic figure, all holy and majestic, straight up descended from the heavenly realm!"
Daniel,4,14,"He shouted out and said, like, totally chop down that tree and trim off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit all over the place! Make sure the animals steer clear of it and the birds fly away from its branches, ya know? {shouting: in Chaldee, super powerfully}"
Daniel,4,15,"But like, keep the stump of his roots in the ground, yo! Wrap it up with some iron and brass, right there in the fresh grass. Let it soak up the dew from the sky, dude. And let him chill with the animals in the grass, man."
Daniel,4,16,May his mindset shift from being human-like to that of a wild creature; and he shall endure a period of seven times before his restoration.
Daniel,4,17,"So basically, the watchers and the holy ones are making it known that the most High is in charge of everything in the human world. He chooses who gets to rule and sometimes even puts the most undeserving people in power."
Daniel,4,18,"So King Nebuchadnezzar had this super lit dream, and he's like, 'Yo, Belteshazzar, you gotta tell me what it means, 'cause all the smarty pants in my kingdom can't figure it out. But I know you got this, 'cause you're blessed with the spirit of the holy gods.'"
Daniel,4,19,"So Daniel, also known as Belteshazzar, was totally shook for like an hour, and his mind was all messed up. Then, the king was like, 'Yo Belteshazzar, don't let this dream and its meaning stress you out.' And Belteshazzar was like, 'Listen up, king. The dream is all about those who hate you, and the meaning is for your enemies.'"
Daniel,4,20,"That tree you saw, it was massive, tall enough to touch the sky, and everyone could see it from all over the world."
Daniel,4,21,"This tree was lit, its leaves were on point, and it had mad fruit. Plus, it had food for everyone - even the animals rolled up and chilled under it. And let's not forget, birds were straight up vibin' on its branches too."
Daniel,4,22,"Yo, king, you've totally leveled up, man! Your power and influence are off the charts, reaching for the stars and extending to every corner of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"So the king looked and saw this heavenly being coming down, telling him to cut down the tree and get rid of it. But the stump and roots should stay in the ground, wrapped with iron and brass, placed in the lush field. It'll be nourished by the dew from heaven, and the king's portion will be among the wild animals until seven periods of time pass."
Daniel,4,24,"Here's the deal, O king. This is what the all-powerful one says, and it's for my esteemed king:"
Daniel,4,25,"They're gonna banish you from society, and you'll end up living among wild animals. You'll have to munch on grass like a cow, and the heavenly mist will moisten you. It'll last for seven cycles until you finally understand that the big boss up there is in charge of the human kingdom, and He gives it to whoever He wants."
Daniel,4,26,"And like, they were all like, 'Leave that stump with its roots intact, bro!' So, basically, your kingdom will be totally secure, my dude, once you realize that the heavens are the ultimate rulers, you know?"
Daniel,4,27,"Yo, king, listen up. Take my advice and vibe with it. Cut out your bad habits by doing what's right, and fix your wrongdoings by helping out the less fortunate. Maybe then you'll find some peace and chill in your life."
Daniel,4,28,The king Nebuchadnezzar got hit with all of this.
Daniel,4,29,"After a whole year, he casually strolled around the rad palace in Babylon."
Daniel,4,30,"So, like, the king was all like, 'Yo, check this out! Isn't Babylon amazing? Like, I totally built this awesome kingdom with all my power and majesty, you know, to flex and show off?'"
Daniel,4,31,"So, like, as the king was talking, a voice from heaven suddenly spoke out and was all like, 'Yo, King Nebuchadnezzar, listen up. This is what's going down: The kingdom is totally being snatched away from you.'"
Daniel,4,32,"And they're gonna totally banish you from hanging out with humans, like you gotta chill with the wild animals instead. They're gonna make you munch on grass like a cow, and you'll be in this state for seven rounds until you finally realize that the ultimate power is in charge of the human kingdom, and he hands it over to whoever he wants."
Daniel,4,33,"So like, right at that exact moment, what the prophet said about Nebuchadnezzar actually happened. He got totally kicked out of civilization, started chowing down on grass like a cow, and his body was, like, drenched in heavenly dew until his hair was all wild like an eagle's feathers and his nails grew out like a bird's claws or whatever."
Daniel,4,34,"So, like, after a while, Nebuchadnezzar looked up to the sky and suddenly he was all aware again. He was like, 'Yo, the most High be blessed!' He started praising and honoring this everlasting dude who rules forever and has a kingdom that just keeps going from one generation to the next."
Daniel,4,35,"And everyone on Earth is seen as insignificant, but he does whatever he wants in heaven and on Earth, and no one can stop him or question his actions."
Daniel,4,36,"Then, like, suddenly my brain was back to normal, you know? And dude, the glory of my kingdom was restored to me, along with all the respect and brilliance. My advisors and my crew were all like coming to me for advice, man. My rule was solidified, and I was, like, blessed with this awesome majestic vibe, you feel me?"
Daniel,4,37,"Yo, I gotta give mad props to the King of heaven! His game is on point, everything He does is straight up legit, and He never holds back with His judgments. And let me tell you, anyone who acts all high and mighty, He's definitely got the power to bring 'em down."
Daniel,5,1,"King Belshazzar threw this epic party with a squad of a thousand of his VIPs, and they were straight up vibing with that wine."
Daniel,5,2,"So, like, Belshazzar was all chilling and sipping his wine, and he was like, 'Yo, bring me those dope gold and silver items my dad Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem.' He wanted to flex on the gram with his crew, including his homies, wives, and side pieces, by drinking from those fancy cups and stuff."
Daniel,5,3,"So they brought the super fancy stuff that they took from the temple in Jerusalem, and the king, his squad, his wives, and his side chicks used them to sip their drinks."
Daniel,5,4,"They were sippin' wine and praising the gods of bling, flexin' gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone."
Daniel,5,5,"Suddenly, fingers appeared and started writing on the wall across from the candlestick in the king's palace. The king caught a glimpse of the hand as it wrote."
Daniel,5,6,"Like, the king's whole vibe totally shifted, and he was legit freaked out, to the point where he couldn't even stand straight and his knees were, like, knocking together."
Daniel,5,7,"The king shouted out to summon the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, saying to the wise folks of Babylon, whoever can read this text and explain its meaning to me will be dressed in a dope scarlet outfit, rockin' a sick gold chain around their neck, and become the third-in-command in the kingdom. (by the way, 'aloud' in Chaldee means 'with might', and 'scarlet' can also mean 'purple')"
Daniel,5,8,"So all the king's smart peeps came in, but they couldn't even decode that scribble or spill the tea to the king about what it meant."
Daniel,5,9,"So then King Belshazzar totally freaked out, and you could see it all over his face, and his crew was totally shocked."
Daniel,5,10,"So, the queen came into the party place because of what the king and his crew were saying. And then, the queen spoke up and said, 'Hey king, live long and prosper! Don't let your worries bother you or let them show on your face.'"
Daniel,5,11,"Yo, there's this dude in your kingdom who's got the spirit of the holy gods in him. Back in the day, your dad was all about this guy's light, understanding, and wisdom - like, even on par with the gods! Your dad, King Nebuchadnezzar, made this dude the boss of magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and all those soothsayer peeps. And we're talking about your actual dad here, not just your grandpa or anything, straight up."
Daniel,5,12,"So, like, Daniel was super awesome and had mad skills in having a totally sharp mind, being wise, decoding dreams, explaining complicated stuff, and getting rid of any uncertainties. The king even gave him the cool name Belteshazzar. Now, we gotta summon Daniel because he's about to drop some serious knowledge bombs with his interpretations."
Daniel,5,13,"So, like, Daniel was brought before the king, right? And the king, like, starts talking to him and asks, 'Yo, are you that Daniel dude? The one who's from the peeps of Judah, like, you know, the ones my dad, or maybe my grandpa, brought outta Jewry?'"
Daniel,5,14,"I've heard about you, fam, that you're all about that divine energy, with some major lit vibes and mad wisdom. You're straight fire!"
Daniel,5,15,"So these really knowledgeable guys, the astrologers, were called in to read this writing and tell me what it means. But hey, they couldn't figure out the interpretation of it. Bummer."
Daniel,5,16,"So, like, word on the street is that you're totally legit at decoding stuff and clearing up confusion. If you can actually read this writing and tell me what it means, I'll hook you up with some sweet scarlet threads, a sick gold chain for your neck, and you'll score the title of third-in-command in the kingdom. No joke, man. Let's see what you got."
Daniel,5,17,"So, like, Daniel spoke up and was all like, 'Yo, King, keep your gifts and rewards for yourself. Give them to someone else. But I got you, I'll read the message and share its meaning with you, no worries.'"
Daniel,5,18,"Yo, king! The all-powerful God hooked up your pops, Nebuchadnezzar, with a sick kingdom, loads of respect, and mad honor. Can you dig it?"
Daniel,5,19,"And yo, 'cos of how awesome he made him, all the peeps, nations, and languages were straight shook and terrified of him: he could straight up kill whoever he wanted, keep whoever he wanted alive, promote whoever he wanted, and demote whoever he wanted."
Daniel,5,20,"But when he started feeling himself all high and mighty, and let his ego take over, he got kicked off his royal throne, and they stripped him of his glory."
Daniel,5,21,"And he got kicked out from hanging with the cool crowd; and his heart turned into beast mode, and he started living with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like they do to the cattle, and his body got soaked by the cool dew from the sky; until he realized that the all-powerful God calls the shots in the kingdom of humans, and He puts whoever He wants in charge. (or, he turned his heart into beast mode, etc)"
Daniel,5,22,"And yo, Belshazzar, bro, you haven't even shown a bit of humility, even though you knew what was up."
Daniel,5,23,"But you have acted rebelliously against the almighty Lord; you and your squad thought it was cool to flex with the sacred stuff from His crib. You and your clique, your partners, your wifey, and your side-chicks all chugged that wine from those holy cups. And to top it off, you even gave props to these worthless gods made of silver, gold, brass, iron, wood, and stone, even though they can't see, hear, or understand anything. Meanwhile, the true God, who controls your every breath and directs your whole life, you completely disregarded and disrespected."
Daniel,5,24,"And then He sent a message via DM with a pic of His hand. And, like, He totally wrote this dope message."
Daniel,5,25,"So, like, there was this writing on the wall, it was all like MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,"So, like, here's what this means: MENE. God has checked out your kingdom and it's game over."
Daniel,5,27,"You've been weighed and, like, ultra-judged, and sorry to say, but you didn't measure up, fam."
Daniel,5,28,"Fam, your kingdom's straight up split and handed over to the Medes and Persians."
Daniel,5,29,"So Belshazzar was like, 'Yo, give Daniel some fancy clothes and put a dope gold chain around his neck.' Then he made a big announcement saying that Daniel was gonna be the third-in-command in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,"On that night, Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldeans, was taken out."
Daniel,5,31,And Darius the Median became king when he was around sixty-two years old. (Note: 'Chaldee' means that he was from the Chaldean dynasty)
Daniel,6,1,Darius was totally stoked about appointing a whole bunch of 120 top-tier dudes to rule over the entire kingdom.
Daniel,6,2,"And there were three presidents, and Daniel was the top one. The princes would report to them, so the king wouldn't have any problems."
Daniel,6,3,"So, like, this guy Daniel totally stood out from all the other top officials and important people 'cause he had, like, this amazing vibe about him. The king was even thinking of promoting him to rule over the entire kingdom. Impressive, right?"
Daniel,6,4,"So, like, the big shots and VIPs were totally looking to find some dirt on Daniel when it came to his position in the kingdom, but they couldn't find any reason or fault. I mean, the guy was legit loyal and flawless; there weren't any slip-ups or faults in him at all."
Daniel,6,5,"Yo, these dudes were like, 'We can't catch Daniel slipping unless we pin something on him regarding his faith and religious laws.'"
Daniel,6,6,"So like, all these presidents and princes came together and went up to the king, and were all like, Kingg Darius, wish you a long, happy life, dude!'"
Daniel,6,7,"So, like, all the big shots in the kingdom - the presidents, governors, princes, counselors, and captains - got together to make this super official rule. It’s like a royal decree, you know? They decided that for a whole month, anyone who asks for anything from a god or a person, aside from you, O King, will be thrown into the lions' den. So intense, right? {decree: or, interdict}"
Daniel,6,8,"Yo, king, lock in the decree and put your signature on that document, no changing allowed. This is the law of the Medes and Persians, it's solid like a rock. {altereth not: Chaldee, passeth not}"
Daniel,6,9,"So like, King Darius was totally down to sign off on the whole writing and decree thing."
Daniel,6,10,"So like, when Daniel found out that they made this new law, he went back to his crib and opened his windows that faced Jerusalem. And every day, three times a day, he got on his knees, said his prayers, and thanked his God, just like he always did."
Daniel,6,11,"So, like, these dudes got together and spotted Daniel doing his thing, you know, praying and making requests to his God."
Daniel,6,12,"So they came up and talked to the king about the king's edict. Didn't you sign a decree saying that anyone who asks for anything from any god or person within thirty days, except you, king, will be thrown into the lion's den? The king replied, Yup, that's true, according to the unchangeable law of the Medes and Persians."
Daniel,6,13,"And they were like, 'Yo, King! Daniel, he's from Judah and he ain't even care 'bout your rules or the decree you signed. He be prayin' three times a day, no matter what.'"
Daniel,6,14,"When the king heard what was said, he got really mad at himself and focused all his attention on saving Daniel. He worked hard until the sun went down, trying to find a way to rescue him."
Daniel,6,15,"So, like, these dudes gathered around the king and were all like, 'Yo, listen up, King, here's the deal - in Medes and Persians land, once the king makes a decree or sets up a law, it's like, set in stone and can't be messed with, you know?"
Daniel,6,16,"So the king was like, 'Yo, bring Daniel here and throw him in the lion's den.' And then the king was all like, 'Listen up, Daniel, your God that you're always loyal to, He will totally save you, dude.'"
Daniel,6,17,"So, they brought this massive stone and covered the den's mouth with it. And not only that, the king sealed it up real tight with his own signet ring, along with the rings of his crew. No chance of changing their minds about what to do with Daniel!"
Daniel,6,18,"And then the king went back to his crib, pulling an all-nighter with no music playing, and he couldn't even catch some Z's."
Daniel,6,19,So the king woke up super early in the morning and headed over to the lions' den in a total hurry.
Daniel,6,20,"When he got to the den, he yelled to Daniel with a super sad voice: 'Yo, Daniel, my dude! The king asked Daniel, 'Hey, Daniel, you're always serving the one true God, right? Can He save you from these lions?'"
Daniel,6,21,"Yo, King, live your best life forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"Yo, my God just sent his angel and totally silenced those lions! They didn't even lay a paw on me 'cause, you know, I'm innocent in his eyes. And don't worry, King, I ain't done no harm to you either!"
Daniel,6,23,"The king was super stoked and told them to rescue Daniel from the den. They lifted Daniel out of the pit and he wasn't hurt at all, 'cause he had mad faith in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"So the king was like, 'Yo, grab those dudes who accused Daniel and throw them into the lion's den along with their families. And let me tell you, those lions totally owned them - breaking all their bones before they even hit the bottom of the den."
Daniel,6,25,"Yo, King Darius hit up everyone across the globe – people of all kinds, from every nation and language. Just wanted to spread some love and say, may peace be multiplied to all of y'all."
Daniel,6,26,"Listen up, y'all! I'm dropping a major announcement: In every part of my kingdom, I'm making it known that everyone better respect and fear the God of Daniel. He's legit the real deal, alive and steady forever. His kingdom is unshakeable, and he'll be in charge forever and ever."
Daniel,6,27,"He's like, super amazing, you know? He saves the day, does crazy awesome miracles both up in the sky and on Earth. And get this, he totally came through and saved Daniel from those lion dudes! Like, talk about a total boss move. {power: Chaldee, hand}"
Daniel,6,28,Daniel totally thrived during Darius' rule and also when Cyrus the Persian was in charge. The dude was straight up successful!
Daniel,7,1,"So, like, during King Belshazzar's first year in Babylon, Daniel had this totally wild dream, you know? He was chilling on his bed, when suddenly, he started seeing all these crazy visions in his head. It was so intense that he had to write it all down and spill the details of what went down. It was all, like, important stuff, you feel me?"
Daniel,7,2,"So, like, Daniel was talking and he was all, yo, I had this epic vision in the middle of the night, and guess what? I saw these mad four winds of the sky going all out on the huge sea."
Daniel,7,3,"Like, there were these four epic beasts that totally rose up from the sea, and they were all unique in their own way, you know. Each one had something different going on!"
Daniel,7,4,"The first one was totally fierce, like a lion, with epic eagle wings and all. But yo, I watched as those wings got straight up plucked off, and it got lifted up off the ground and stood up like a human, with a heart of its own and everything. No joke, it got a whole new vibe going on, man."
Daniel,7,5,"Yo, check out this other beast, it's like a bear but with a twist. It's all flexing on one side, and it's got three ribs in its mouth, chillin' between its teeth. Then they straight up told it, 'Yo, go out and chow down on some serious flesh.'"
Daniel,7,6,"Yo, I saw this crazy thing after that - it was like a leopard, but it had four wings on its back like a bird. And get this, it had four heads too! Total ruler vibes on this beast, like it was granted some serious power."
Daniel,7,7,"So, like, I had this vision in the middle of the night, right? And there was this super wild and scary fourth beast. It was like, insanely powerful and had these huge iron teeth. It would totally chomp down and break everything apart, and then trample on whatever was left with its feet. And get this, it was like no other beast that came before it - totally unique. Oh, and it had ten horns, FYI."
Daniel,7,8,"So, like, I saw these horns, right? And guess what? Another small horn popped up outta nowhere! And get this, it totally uprooted three of the original horns! But that's not all, man. This horn had eyes that looked just like a human’s and a mouth that was saying some seriously impressive stuff!"
Daniel,7,9,"I was watching until the thrones got yeeted, and the OG of all time took a seat, with an outfit as pristine as fresh snow and hair as fluffy as pure wool. Their throne was lit like fire, and their wheels were on fire too."
Daniel,7,10,"Like, this intense stream of fire burst out in front of him, and there were, legit, like, a bazillion angels serving him, and like, a hundred million angels were just standing there in front of him. And then, it was time for the ultimate judgment, and, bro, the books were totally opened, like, to spill out all the deets."
Daniel,7,11,"Yo, I was watching and listening to this powerful horn spewing major words. And I kept watching until the beast got totally wrecked, his body destroyed, and tossed into the burning flames."
Daniel,7,12,"Like, the other animals had their power taken away, but they still got to keep living for a little while longer. It's like, they got an extension on their life, you know? Like, they got some extra time to roam around and stuff. (Chaldee, it was like they were given this extra time to live)"
Daniel,7,13,"So, like, I had this dream at night, and I was like, whoa! There was this dude who looked super cool, kind of like the Son of man, coming down from the sky on some epic clouds. And then he went up to this Ancient of days, and they totally brought him close to him."
Daniel,7,14,"And he was totally given power, fame, and a whole kingdom, so that all people, from every nation and language, would be like, serving him, you know? His power is gonna last forever, like it's never gonna fade away, and his kingdom is gonna be super strong, like it'll never ever be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"So basically, I, Daniel, was feeling really down and unsettled. It's like my mind was filled with these disturbing visions that were freaking me out."
Daniel,7,16,I went up to one of the people there and asked them what was really going on. They filled me in and explained the meaning of everything.
Daniel,7,17,"Yo, check it out! These huge beasts, like four of 'em, represent four kings that are gonna pop up from the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the super cool and righteous peeps of the most epic High will totally grab the kingdom and own it forever and ever, like, for all eternity and stuff. {most...: Chaldee, high ones, that is, things, or, places}"
Daniel,7,19,"So, like, I really wanted to uncover the whole deal about the fourth beast. It was totally different from the others, like super scary. It had these crazy iron teeth and brass nails. It would, like, gobble everything up, break things into pieces, and then stomp all over what was left. The Chaldee peeps said it was unlike anything else."
Daniel,7,20,"And there were ten horns on his head, and another one popped up and three fell before it. This new horn had eyes and a mouth that said some seriously big things. It was way more confident than the others around it."
Daniel,7,21,"Yo, I saw this crazy horn straight up starting beef with the saints and actually coming out on top; like, it won the battle and stuff, no cap."
Daniel,7,22,"Until the OG came through, and the homies got their rightful judgment; and it was finally time for the squad to rule the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"So basically, he was like, 'Yo, the fourth beast is gonna be this whole new kingdom on earth, completely different from everything that's come before. It's gonna straight up devour the whole earth, trample it down, and break it into pieces.'"
Daniel,7,24,"So there's gonna be these ten horns from the kingdom, right? And they're like ten kings who are gonna come up. And then there's this other dude who's gonna rise after them. He's gonna be totally different from the first guy, and he's gonna take down three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"And he's gonna totally trash-talk the Most High, and he'll be a major annoyance to the saints. He'll even try to mess with the rules and laws, but don't worry, it'll only be temporary. He'll have some power, but it won't last forever, just for a while."
Daniel,7,26,"But, like, there's gonna be this final evaluation, where they're gonna strip him of his power and totally annihilate it, all the way to the end, you know."
Daniel,7,27,"And like, the kingdom and power and greatness of the kingdom across the whole wide world will totally be handed over to the people who are, like, super blessed and loyal to the most High. Their kingdom is, like, gonna last forever, and all the rulers and leaders will totally serve and obey them."
Daniel,7,28,"That's basically it, the end of the story. So, like, for real, guys, I gotta be honest, I was totally freaking out and it showed on my face. But I, Daniel, kept all my thoughts and feelings to myself."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year that king Belshazzar was in charge, I, Daniel, had a vision. It happened after the first vision I had."
Daniel,8,2,"So, like, I had this super cool vision, right? And it was, like, totally awesome because I found myself at Shushan, you know, the fancy palace in the province of Elam. And in this vision, I was chilling by the river of Ulai, just taking it all in."
Daniel,8,3,"So, like, I looked up and I saw this totally rad ram with two massive horns, standing by the river. And yo, the horns were pretty big, but one was even bigger than the other, and it grew last."
Daniel,8,4,"I peeped the ram flexing in all directions - west, north, south; and no other animals could even handle him, there was literally no one who could stop him; he did whatever he wanted and straight up became a legend."
Daniel,8,5,"So, as I was thinking, yo, this super cool goat rolls up from the west, like, gliding over the whole earth without even touching the ground. And check it, this goat has this epic horn smack dab between its eyes - totally eye-catching, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Daniel,8,6,"And he approached the ram with two epic horns, which I had witnessed chillin' by the river, and literally charged at him with all his powerful vibes."
Daniel,8,7,"So, like, I witnessed this intense face-off between the dude and the ram. He got super angry and attacked the ram, breaking its two horns. The ram couldn't do anything against him and got knocked down to the ground. And to top it off, he totally stomped on the ram. Nobody could save the ram from his grasp."
Daniel,8,8,"So the he goat flexed and got hella powerful: and when he became lit, the big horn got shattered; and then four sick ones appeared, each going in a different direction like the four winds in the sky."
Daniel,8,9,"Yo, one of those bad boys sprouted a tiny horn that straight up blew up, heading towards the south, east, and some beautiful spot."
Daniel,8,10,"And it became super powerful, like reaching the whole squad of celestials; and it brought down a few of the squad members and stars to the ground, and totally crushed them. (or, against the squad)"
Daniel,8,11,"Yeah, this dude thought he was all that, even disrespecting the boss of the crew. He messed up the daily grind, taking away the sacrifices and wrecking the holy spot. All 'cause of his ego trip."
Daniel,8,12,"And like, this whole army was sent because of, you know, all the wrongdoings and stuff, and it totally like trashed the truth and just did its own thing, and it, like, totally succeeded."
Daniel,8,13,"So, like, I was listening to this saint dude, and then another saint dude was like, yo, how much longer is this vision gonna go on about the daily sacrifices and the messed up stuff happening in the sanctuary? Like, when will the holy place and the people get trampled on?"
Daniel,8,14,"And he told me, it's gonna take two thousand and three hundred days for the sanctuary to be all cool and clean. You know, like, just righteous and justified, y'know? {days: in Hebrew it means like, evening morning} {cleansed: in Hebrew it means like, totally justified}"
Daniel,8,15,"So, like, I was totally Daniel, right? And I was checking out this epic vision and really wanted to figure out what it all meant. And guess what? Out of nowhere, this dude pops up in front of me, looking like a real person and all."
Daniel,8,16,"And I was like, totally chillin' by the Ulai river, when suddenly I heard this dude's voice sayin', 'Yo, Gabriel! Help this guy grasp the vision, bro.'"
Daniel,8,17,"Dude, he came up to me, and I was totally freaked out and fell flat on my face. But then he was like, 'Listen up, bro! Get this, future man: this vision is gonna go down when everything's wrapping up!'"
Daniel,8,18,"So, like, while he was talking to me, I was like, totally knocked out asleep with my face on the ground. But then he tapped me and helped me stand up."
Daniel,8,19,"And he was like, yo, listen up - I'm gonna drop some knowledge on you about what's gonna go down in the final days of all that anger stuff. It's gonna happen exactly when it's supposed to, no doubt."
Daniel,8,20,"So, like, that ram you saw with those two cool horns? Well, those horns actually represent the kings of Media and Persia, you know?"
Daniel,8,21,"The goat that's all wild and rebellious, dude, he's like the ultimate ruler of Greece, you know? And that gnarly horn he's got smack in the middle of his forehead? That represents the OG king, the one who started it all, ya know?"
Daniel,8,22,"And once it's shattered, four others will rise up in its place, representing four kingdoms that will emerge from the same nation, yet with lesser power."
Daniel,8,23,"And in the later period of their reign, when the rebellious ones have reached their peak, a king with a strong presence, skilled in deciphering mysterious messages, will emerge. {are...: Heb. are accomplished}"
Daniel,8,24,"And his strength will be absolutely epic, like, totally beyond his own abilities, you know? He's gonna wreck things in a mind-blowing way, and he'll totally succeed and do his thing, you feel me? He's gonna take down all those super powerful people and even mess with the sacred ones, like woah!"
Daniel,8,25,"And by using his strategy, he will make his cunning thrive; he will boost his ego and use diplomacy to bring about destruction for many. He will even dare to challenge the Prince of princes, but in the end, he will be defeated without any physical force."
Daniel,8,26,"And, like, the evening and morning vision that was told, it's totally legit, you know? So, like, keep it on the down low for a while, 'cause it's gonna take a minute to happen, you feel me?"
Daniel,8,27,"So I, Daniel, totally passed out and was sick for, like, several days. But then I got up and got back to work for the king. And let me tell ya, I was mind-blown by the vision, but no one else could make heads or tails of it."
Daniel,9,1,"Back in the day when Darius, Ahasuerus' kid, was sitting on the throne as king of the Chaldeans, ya know..."
Daniel,9,2,"So, like, in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, was, like, reading some books and stuff, and I totally figured out that the LORD had told Jeremiah the prophet that, you know, Jerusalem was gonna be wrecked for like seventy years or something."
Daniel,9,3,"So I turned to the Lord God, seeking Him through prayer, asking for His help, and fasting, wearing sackcloth and covering myself with ashes:"
Daniel,9,4,"So, ya know, I reached out to the big G upstairs, my God, and I totally poured my heart out. I was like, 'Yo, Lord, you're seriously awesome and terrifying, and you always stick to your promises and show mad love to those who are all about you and stay loyal to your rules.'"
Daniel,9,5,"We messed up big time, like seriously, we did some shady stuff, straight up wicked and rebellious. We totally went against your rules and judgments:"
Daniel,9,6,"And we totally ignored what your prophets were saying, like, they were speaking on your behalf to our kings, princes, parents, and everybody else in the whole country."
Daniel,9,7,"Yo God, you're all about righteousness, but we're all messed up and embarrassed, just like today. This goes for the peeps in Judah, Jerusalem, and all over Israel, whether they're close or far away in all the places you sent them because they screwed up and betrayed you."
Daniel,9,8,"Yo, God, we messed up big time. Our leaders, our fam, everyone's feeling embarrassed and ashamed because we straight up sinned against you."
Daniel,9,9,"God's got mad love and forgiveness for us, even though we've straight up rebelled against him;"
Daniel,9,10,We totally haven't listened to the LORD our God and followed his rules that he laid out for us through his prophets.
Daniel,9,11,"Yeah, so like, everyone in Israel straight up broke your law by, like, totally going against your commands. And because of that, we're all like cursed and stuff, you know? It's all written in the law of Moses, God's faithful servant, 'cause we messed up and sinned against him."
