Daniel,9,12,And He has carried out intact His [threatening] words which He threatened against us and against our judges [the kings princes and rulers generally] who ruled us and He has brought upon us a great evil; for under the whole heavens there has not been done before [anything so dreadful] as [He has caused to be] done against Jerusalem.
Daniel,9,13,Just as it is written in the Law of Moses as to all this evil [that would surely come upon transgressors] so it has come upon us. Yet we have not earnestly begged for forgiveness and entreated the favor of the Lord our God that we might turn from our iniquities and have understanding and become wise in Your truth.
Daniel,9,14,Therefore the Lord has kept ready the calamity (evil) and has brought it upon us for the Lord our God is [uncompromisingly] righteous and rigidly just in all His works which He does [keeping His word]; and we have not obeyed His voice.
Daniel,9,15,And now O Lord our God Who brought Your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and secured Yourself renown and a name as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly!
Daniel,9,16,O Lord according to all Your rightness and justice I beseech You let Your anger and Your wrath be turned away from Your city Jerusalem Your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach and a byword to all who are around about us.
Daniel,9,17,Now therefore O our God listen to and heed the prayer of Your servant [Daniel] and his supplications and for Your own sake cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary which is desolate.
Daniel,9,18,O my God incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and look at our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You for our own righteousness and justice but for Your great mercy and loving-kindness.
Daniel,9,19,O Lord hear! O Lord forgive! O Lord give heed and act! Do not delay for Your own sake O my God because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.
Daniel,9,20,While I was speaking and praying confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy hill of my God--
Daniel,9,21,Yes while I was speaking in prayer the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the former vision being caused to fly swiftly came near to me and touched me about the time of the evening sacrifice.
Daniel,9,22,He instructed me and made me understand; he talked with me and said O Daniel I am now come forth to give you skill and wisdom and understanding.
Daniel,9,23,At the beginning of your prayers the word [giving an answer] went forth and I have come to tell you for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision.
Daniel,9,24,Seventy weeks [of years or 490 years] are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city [Jerusalem] to finish and put an end to transgression to seal up and make full the measure of sin to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin to bring in everlasting righteousness (permanent moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation) to seal up vision and prophecy and prophet and to anoint a Holy of Holies.
Daniel,9,25,Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until [the coming of] the Anointed One a Prince shall be seven weeks [of years] and sixty-two weeks [of years]; it shall be built again with [city] square and moat but in troublous times.
Daniel,9,26,And after the sixty-two weeks [of years] shall the Anointed One be cut off or killed and shall have nothing [and no one] belonging to [and defending] Him. And the people of the [other] prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood; and even to the end there shall be war and desolations are decreed.
Daniel,9,27,And he shall enter into a strong and firm covenant with the many for one week [seven years]. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and offering to cease [for the remaining three and one-half years]; and upon the wing or pinnacle of abominations [shall come] one who makes desolate until the full determined end is poured out on the desolator.
Daniel,10,1,IN THE third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel who was called Belteshazzar. And the word was true and it referred to great tribulation (conflict and wretchedness). And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.
Daniel,10,2,In those days I Daniel was mourning for three whole weeks.
Daniel,10,3,I ate no pleasant or desirable food nor did any meat or wine come into my mouth; and I did not anoint myself at all for the full three weeks.
Daniel,10,4,On the twenty-fourth day of the first month as I was on the bank of the great river Hiddekel [which is the Tigris]
Daniel,10,5,I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz.
Daniel,10,6,His body also was [a golden luster] like beryl his face had the appearance of lightning his eyes were like flaming torches his arms and his feet like glowing burnished bronze and the sound of his words was like the noise of a multitude [of people or the roaring of the sea].
Daniel,10,7,And I Daniel alone saw the vision [of this heavenly being] for the men who were with me did not see the vision but a great trembling fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves.
Daniel,10,8,So I was left alone and saw this great vision and no strength was left in me for my fresh appearance was turned to pallor; I grew weak and faint [with fright].
Daniel,10,9,Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words I fell on my face in a deep sleep with my face [sunk] to the ground.
Daniel,10,10,And behold a hand touched me which set me [unsteadily] upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
Daniel,10,11,And [the angel] said to me O Daniel you greatly beloved man understand the words that I speak to you and stand upright for to you I am now sent. And while he was saying this word to me I stood up trembling.
Daniel,10,12,Then he said to me Fear not Daniel for from the first day that you set your mind and heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God your words were heard and I have come as a consequence of [and in response to] your words.
Daniel,10,13,But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. Then Michael one of the chief [of the celestial] princes came to help me for I remained there with the kings of Persia.
Daniel,10,14,Now I have come to make you understand what is to befall your people in the latter days for the vision is for [many] days yet to come.
Daniel,10,15,When he had spoken to me according to these words I turned my face toward the ground and was dumb.
Daniel,10,16,And behold one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me O my lord by reason of the vision sorrows and pains have come upon me and I retain no strength.
Daniel,10,17,For how can my lord's servant [who is so feeble] talk with this my lord? For now no strength remains in me nor is there any breath left in me.
Daniel,10,18,Then there touched me again one whose appearance was like that of a man and he strengthened me.
Daniel,10,19,And he said O man greatly beloved fear not! Peace be to you! Be strong yes be strong. And when he had spoken to me I was strengthened and said Let my lord speak for you have strengthened me.
Daniel,10,20,Then he said Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the [hostile] prince of Persia; and when I have gone behold the [hostile] prince of Greece will come.
Daniel,10,21,But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth or the Book of Truth. There is no one who holds with me and strengthens himself against these [hostile spirit forces] except Michael your prince [national guardian angel].
Daniel,11,1,ALSO I [the angel] in the first year of Darius the Mede even I stood up to confirm and to strengthen him [Michael the angelic prince].
Daniel,11,2,And now I will show you the truth. Behold there shall arise three more kings in Persia and a fourth shall be far richer than they all. And when he has become strong through his riches he shall stir up and stake all against the realm of Greece.
Daniel,11,3,Then a mighty [warlike threatening] king shall arise who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his [own] will.
Daniel,11,4,And as soon as he has fully arisen his [Alexander the Great's] kingdom shall be broken [by his death] and divided toward the four winds [the east west north and south] of the heavens but not to his posterity nor according to the [Grecian] dominion which he ruled for his kingdom shall be torn out and uprooted and go to others [to his four generals] to the exclusion of these.
Daniel,11,5,Then the king of the South (Egypt) shall be strong but one of his princes shall be stronger than he is and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
Daniel,11,6,At the end of some years they [the king of the North Syria and the king of the South Egypt] shall make an alliance; the daughter of the king of the South shall come to the king of the North to make [a just and peaceful marriage] agreement; but she shall not retain the power of her might neither shall he and his might endure. She shall be handed over with her attendants her child and him who strengthened her in those times.
Daniel,11,7,But out of a branch of the [same ancestral] roots as hers shall one [her brother] stand up in his place or office who shall come against the [Syrian] army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the North and shall deal against them and shall prevail.
Daniel,11,8,And also he shall carry off to Egypt their [Syria's] gods with their molten images and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold and he shall refrain for some years from [waging war against] the king of the North.
Daniel,11,9,And he [the king of Syria] shall come into the kingdom of the king of the South but shall return to his own land.
Daniel,11,10,But his sons shall be stirred up and shall prepare for war and shall assemble a multitude of great forces which shall come on and overflow and pass through and again shall make war even to the fortress [of the king of the South].
Daniel,11,11,And the king of the South (Egypt) shall be moved with anger and shall come forth and fight with the king of the North (Syria); and he [the Syrian king] shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given into his [the Egyptian king's] hand.
Daniel,11,12,When the multitude is taken and carried away the heart and mind [of the Egyptian king] shall be exalted and he shall cast down tens of thousands but he shall not prevail.
Daniel,11,13,For the king of the North shall raise a multitude greater than [he had] before and after some years shall certainly return coming with a great army and much substance and equipment.
Daniel,11,14,In those times many shall rise up against the king of the South (Egypt); also the men of violence among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the visions [of Dan. 8 and 9] but they shall fail and fall.
Daniel,11,15,Then the king of the North shall come and cast up siege works and take a well-fortified city and the forces of the South shall not stand or even his chosen troops for there shall be no strength to stand [against the Syrian king].
Daniel,11,16,But he [Antiochus the Great] who comes against him [from Syria] shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him; he shall stand in the glorious land [of Israel] and in his hand shall be destruction and all the land shall be in his power.
Daniel,11,17,He [Antiochus the Great] shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom and with him upright conditions and terms of peace and he shall perform them [by making an agreement with the king of the South]. He shall give him [his] daughter to corrupt and destroy it [his league with Egypt] and the kingdom but it shall not succeed or be to his advantage.
Daniel,11,18,After this he shall turn his attention to the islands and coastlands and shall take over many of them. But a prince or commander shall teach him [Antiochus the Great] to put an end to the insults offered by him; in fact he shall turn his insolence and reproaches back upon him.
Daniel,11,19,Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land [of Syria] but he shall stumble and fall and not be found.
Daniel,11,20,Then shall stand up in his place or office one who shall send an exactor of tribute to pass through the glory of the kingdom but within a few days he shall be destroyed [yet] neither in anger nor in battle.
Daniel,11,21,And in his place or office [in Syria] shall arise a contemptuous and contemptible person to whom royal majesty and honor of the kingdom have not been given. But he shall come in without warning in time of security and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries intrigues and cunning hypocritical conduct.
Daniel,11,22,Before him the overwhelming forces of invading armies shall be broken and utterly swept away; yes and a prince of the covenant [with those who were at peace with him] also [shall be broken and swept away].
Daniel,11,23,And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall work deceitfully and he shall come up unexpectedly and shall become strong with a small people.
Daniel,11,24,Without warning and stealthily he shall come into the most productive places of a province or among the richest men of a province [of Egypt] and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers' fathers; he shall distribute among them plunder spoil and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds--but only for a time [the period decreed by God].
Daniel,11,25,And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South [Egypt] with a great army; and the king of the South shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army but he shall not stand for schemes shall be devised against [the king of the South].
Daniel,11,26,Yes those who eat of his rich and dainty food shall break and destroy him and his army shall drift or turn away to flee and many shall fall down slain.
Daniel,11,27,And as for both of these kings their hearts and minds shall be set on doing mischief; they shall speak lies over the same table but it will not succeed for the end is yet to be at the time appointed.
Daniel,11,28,Then shall [the vile conqueror from the North] return into his land with much booty; and his heart and purpose shall be set against [God's] holy covenant [with His people] and he shall accomplish [his malicious intention] and return to his own land [Syria].
Daniel,11,29,At the time appointed [God's own time] he shall return and come into the South but it shall not be successful as were the former invasions [of Egypt].
Daniel,11,30,For the ships of Kittim [or Cyprus in Roman hands] shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved and discouraged and turn back [to Palestine] and carry out his rage and indignation against the holy covenant and God's people and he shall do his own pleasure; he shall even turn back and make common cause with those [Jews] who abandon the holy covenant [with God].
Daniel,11,31,And armed forces of his shall appear [in the holy land] and they shall pollute the sanctuary the [spiritual] stronghold and shall take away the continual [daily burnt offering]; and they shall set up [in the sanctuary] the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate [probably an altar to a pagan god].
Daniel,11,32,And such as violate the covenant he shall pervert and seduce with flatteries but the people who know their God shall prove themselves strong and shall stand firm and do exploits [for God].
Daniel,11,33,And they who are wise and understanding among the people shall instruct many and make them understand though some [of them and their followers] shall fall by the sword and flame by captivity and plunder for many days.
Daniel,11,34,Now when they fall they shall receive a little help. Many shall join themselves to them with flatteries and hypocrisies.
Daniel,11,35,And some of those who are wise prudent and understanding shall be weakened and fall [thus then the insincere among the people will lose courage and become deserters. It will be a test] to refine to purify and to make those among [God's people] white even to the time of the end because it is yet for the time [God] appointed.
Daniel,11,36,And the king shall do according to his will; he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that which is determined [by God] shall be done.
Daniel,11,37,He shall not regard the gods of his fathers or Him [to Whom] women desire [to give birth--the Messiah] or any other god for he shall magnify himself above all.
Daniel,11,38,But in their place he shall honor the god of fortresses; a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold and silver with precious stones and with pleasant and expensive things.
Daniel,11,39,And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. Those who acknowledge him he shall magnify with glory and honor and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for a price.
Daniel,11,40,And at the time of the end the king of the South shall push at and attack him and the king of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and horsemen and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass through.
Daniel,11,41,He shall enter into the Glorious Land [Palestine] and many shall be overthrown but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom Moab and the main [core] of the people of Ammon.
Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch out his hand also against the [other] countries but the land of Egypt shall not be among the escaped ones.
Daniel,11,43,But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of Egypt and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall accompany him [compelled to follow his steps].
Daniel,11,44,But rumors from the east and from the north shall alarm and hasten him. And he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.
Daniel,11,45,And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the seas and the glorious holy Mount [Zion]; yet he shall come to his end with none to help him.
Daniel,12,1,AND AT that time [of the end] Michael shall arise the great [angelic] prince who defends and has charge of your [Daniel's] people. And there shall be a time of trouble straitness and distress such as never was since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered everyone whose name shall be found written in the Book [of God's plan for His own].
Daniel,12,2,And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and abhorrence.
Daniel,12,3,And the teachers and those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament and those who turn many to righteousness (to uprightness and right standing with God) [shall give forth light] like the stars forever and ever.
Daniel,12,4,But you O Daniel shut up the words and seal the Book until the time of the end. [Then] many shall run to and fro and search anxiously [through the Book] and knowledge [of God's purposes as revealed by His prophets] shall be increased and become great.
Daniel,12,5,Then I Daniel looked and behold there stood two others the one on the brink of the river on this side and the other on the brink of the river on that side.
Daniel,12,6,And one said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
Daniel,12,7,And I heard the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river when he held up his right and his left hand toward the heavens and swore by Him Who lives forever that it shall be for a time times and a half a time [or three and one-half years]; and when they have made an end of shattering and crushing the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished.
Daniel,12,8,And I heard but I did not understand. Then I said O my lord what shall be the issue and final end of these things?
Daniel,12,9,And he [the angel] said Go your way Daniel for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.
Daniel,12,10,Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be tried smelted and refined but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand but the teachers and those who are wise shall understand.
Daniel,12,11,And from the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up there shall be 1290 days.
Daniel,12,12,Blessed happy fortunate spiritually prosperous and to be envied is he who waits expectantly and earnestly [who endures without wavering beyond the period of tribulation] and comes to the 1335 days!
Daniel,12,13,But you [Daniel who was now over ninety years of age] go your way until the end; for you shall rest and shall stand [fast] in your allotted place at the end of the days.
Hosea,1,1,THE WORD of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel.
Hosea,1,2,When the Lord first spoke with and through Hosea the Lord said to him Go take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of [her] harlotry for the land commits great whoredom by departing from the Lord.
Hosea,1,3,So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim and she became pregnant and bore him a son.
Hosea,1,4,And the Lord said to him Call his name Jezreel or God-sows for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel and visit the punishment for it upon the house of Jehu and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
Hosea,1,5,And on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.
Hosea,1,6,And [Gomer] conceived again and bore a daughter. And the Lord said to Hosea Call her name Lo-Ruhamah or Not-pitied for I will no more have love pity and mercy on the house of Israel that I should in any way pardon them.
Hosea,1,7,But I will have love pity and mercy on the house of Judah and will deliver them by the Lord their God and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by equipment of war nor by horses nor by horsemen.
Hosea,1,8,Now when [Gomer] had weaned Lo-Ruhamah [Not-pitied] she became pregnant [again] and bore a son.
Hosea,1,9,And the Lord said Call his name Lo-Ammi [Not-my-people] for you are not My people and I am not your God.
Hosea,1,10,Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered; and instead of it being said to them You are not My people it shall be said to them Sons of the Living God!
Hosea,1,11,Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall go up out of the land for great shall be the day of Jezreel [for the spiritually reborn Israel a divine offspring the people whom the Lord has blessed.]
Hosea,2,1,[HOSEA] SAY to your brethren Ammi [or You-are-my-people] and to your sisters Ruhamah [or You-have-been-pitied-and-have-obtained-mercy].
Hosea,2,2,Plead with your mother [your nation]; plead for she is not My wife and I am not her Husband; [plead] that she put away her [marks of] harlotry from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts
Hosea,2,3,Lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a parched land and slay her with thirst.
Hosea,2,4,Yes for her children I will have no love nor pity nor mercy for they are the children of harlotry.
Hosea,2,5,For their mother has played the harlot; she who conceived them has done shamefully for she said I will go after my lovers that give me my food and my water my wool and my flax my oil and my refreshing drinks.
Hosea,2,6,Therefore behold I [the Lord God] will hedge up her way [even yours O Israel] with thorns; and I will build a wall against her that she shall not find her paths.
Hosea,2,7,And she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them [inquiring for and requiring them] but shall not find them. Then shall she say Let me go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now.
Hosea,2,8,For she has not noticed understood or realized that it was I [the Lord God] Who gave her the grain and the new wine and the fresh oil and Who lavished upon her silver and gold which they used for Baal and made into his image.
Hosea,2,9,Therefore will I return and take back My grain in the time for it and My new wine in the season for it and will pluck away and recover My wool and My flax which were to cover her [Israel's] nakedness.
Hosea,2,10,And now will I uncover her lewdness and her shame in the sight of her lovers and no one shall rescue her out of My hand.
Hosea,2,11,I will also cause to cease all her mirth her feastmaking her New Moons her Sabbaths and all her solemn feasts and appointed festive assemblies.
Hosea,2,12,And I will lay waste and destroy her vines and her fig trees of which she has said These are my reward or loose woman's hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make [her plantations] an inaccessible forest and the wild beasts of the open country shall eat them.
Hosea,2,13,And I will visit [punishment] upon her for the feast days of the Baals when she burned incense to them and decked herself with her earrings and nose rings and her jewelry and went after her lovers and forgot Me says the Lord.
Hosea,2,14,Therefore behold I will allure her [Israel] and bring her into the wilderness and I will speak tenderly and to her heart.
Hosea,2,15,There I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor [troubling] to be for her a door of hope and expectation. And she shall sing there and respond as in the days of her youth and as at the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
Hosea,2,16,And it shall be in that day says the Lord that you will call Me Ishi [my Husband] and you shall no more call Me Baali [my Baal].
Hosea,2,17,For I will take away the names of Baalim [the Baals] out of her mouth and they shall no more be mentioned or seriously remembered by their name.
Hosea,2,18,And in that day will I make a covenant for Israel with the living creatures of the open country and with the birds of the heavens and with the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword and [abolish battle equipment and] conflict out of the land and will make you lie down safely.
Hosea,2,19,And I will betroth you to Me forever; yes I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and justice in steadfast love and in mercy.
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth you to Me in stability and in faithfulness and you shall know (recognize be acquainted with appreciate give heed to and cherish) the Lord.
Hosea,2,21,And in that day I will respond says the Lord; I will respond to the heavens [which ask for rain to pour on the earth] and they shall respond to the earth [which begs for the rain it needs]
Hosea,2,22,And the earth shall respond to the grain and the wine and the oil [which beseech it to bring them forth] and these shall respond to Jezreel [restored Israel who prays for a supply of them].
Hosea,2,23,And I will sow her for Myself anew in the land and I will have love pity and mercy for her who had not obtained love pity and mercy; and I will say to those who were not My people You are My people and they shall say You are my God!
Hosea,3,1,THEN SAID the Lord to me Go again love [the same] woman [Gomer] who is beloved of a paramour and is an adulteress even as the Lord loves the children of Israel though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins [used in the sacrificial feasts in idol worship].
Hosea,3,2,So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley [the price of a slave].
Hosea,3,3,And I said to her You shall be [betrothed] to me for many days; you shall not play the harlot and you shall not belong to another man. So will I also be to you [until you have proved your loyalty to me and our marital relations may be resumed].
Hosea,3,4,For the children of Israel shall dwell and sit deprived many days without king or prince without sacrifice or [idolatrous] pillar and without ephod [a garment worn by priests when seeking divine counsel] or teraphim (household gods).
Hosea,3,5,Afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God [inquiring of and requiring Him] and [from the line of] David their King [of kings]; and they shall come in [anxious] fear to the Lord and to His goodness and His good things in the latter days.
Hosea,4,1,HEAR THE word of the Lord you children of Israel for the Lord has a controversy (a pleading contention) with the inhabitants of the land because there is no faithfulness love pity and mercy or knowledge of God [from personal experience with Him] in the land.
Hosea,4,2,There is nothing but [false] swearing and breaking faith and killing and stealing and committing adultery; they break out [into violence] one [deed of] bloodshed following close on another.
Hosea,4,3,Therefore shall the land [continually] mourn and all who dwell in it shall languish together with the wild beasts of the open country and the birds of the heavens; yes the fishes of the sea also shall [perish because of the drought] be collected and taken away.
Hosea,4,4,Yet let no man strive neither let any man reprove [another--do not waste your time in mutual recriminations] for with you is My contention O priest.
Hosea,4,5,And you shall stumble in the daytime and the [false] prophet also shall stumble with you in the night; and I will destroy your mother [the priestly nation].
Hosea,4,6,My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you [the priestly nation] have rejected knowledge I will also reject you that you shall be no priest to Me; seeing you have forgotten the law of your God I will also forget your children.
Hosea,4,7,The more they increased and multiplied [in prosperity and power] the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.
Hosea,4,8,They feed on the sin of My people and set their heart on their iniquity.
Hosea,4,9,And it shall be: Like people like priest; I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their doings.
Hosea,4,10,For they shall eat and not have enough; they shall play the harlot and beget no increase because they have forsaken the Lord for harlotry;
Hosea,4,11,Harlotry and wine and new wine take away the heart and the mind and the spiritual understanding.
Hosea,4,12,My people [habitually] ask counsel of their [senseless] wood [idols] and their staff [of wood] gives them oracles and instructs them. For the spirit of harlotry has led them astray and they have played the harlot withdrawing themselves from subjection to their God.
Hosea,4,13,They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and they burn incense upon the hills and under oaks poplars and terebinths because there the shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the harlot and your sons' wives commit adultery.
Hosea,4,14,I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery for [the fathers and husbands] themselves go aside in order to be alone with women who prostitute themselves for gain and they sacrifice at the altar with dedicated harlots [who surrender their chastity in honor of the goddess]. Therefore the people without understanding shall stumble and fall and come to ruin.
Hosea,4,15,Though you Israel play the harlot and worship idols let not Judah offend and become guilty; come not to Gilgal neither go up to Beth-aven [contemptuous reference to Bethel then noted for idolatry] nor swear [in idolatrous service saying] As the Lord lives.
Hosea,4,16,For Israel has behaved stubbornly like a stubborn heifer. How then should he expect to be fed and treated by the Lord like a lamb in a large pasture?
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined [fast] to idols [so] let him alone [to take the consequences].
Hosea,4,18,Their drinking carousal over they go habitually to play the harlot; [Ephraim's] rulers [continue to] love shame more than her glory [which is the Lord Israel's God].
Hosea,4,19,The resistless wind [of God's wrath] has bound up [Israel] in its wings or skirts and [in captivity] they and their altars shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices [to calves to sun moon and stars and to heathen gods].
Hosea,5,1,HEAR THIS O you priests! And listen O house of Israel! And give ear O house of the king! For the judgment pronounced pertains to you and is meant for you because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor [military strongholds on either side of the Jordan River].
Hosea,5,2,The revolters are deeply sunk in corruption and slaughter but I [the Lord God] am a rebuke and a chastisement for them all.
Hosea,5,3,I know Ephraim and Israel is not hid from Me; for now O Ephraim you have played the harlot and have worshiped idols; Israel is defiled.
Hosea,5,4,Their doings will not permit them to return to their God for the spirit of harlotry is within them and they know not the Lord [they do not recognize appreciate give heed to or cherish the Lord].
Hosea,5,5,But the pride and self-reliance of Israel testifies before his [own] face. Therefore shall [all] Israel and [especially] Ephraim [the northern ten tribes] totter and fall in their iniquity and guilt and Judah shall stumble and fall with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord [inquiring for and requiring Him] but they will not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt faithlessly and treacherously with the Lord [their espoused Husband] for they have borne alien children. Now shall a [single] New Moon (one month) devour them with their fields.
Hosea,5,8,Blow the horn in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah [both lofty hills on Benjamin's northern border]. Sound the alarm at Beth-aven: [the enemy is] behind you and after you O Benjamin [be on your guard]!
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke and punishment. Among the tribes of Israel I declare what shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are like those who remove the landmark [the barrier between right and wrong]; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,Ephraim is oppressed; he is broken and crushed by [divine] judgment because he was content to walk after idols (images) and man's [evil] command (vanities and filth).
Hosea,5,12,Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim and like dry rot to the house of Judah [in My judgment against them].
Hosea,5,13,When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to [Assyria's] great King Jareb [for help]. Yet he cannot heal you nor will he cure you of your wound [received in divine judgment].
Hosea,5,14,For I will be to Ephraim like a lion and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I even I will rend and go on [rending]; I will carry off and there will be no one to deliver.
Hosea,5,15,I will return to My place [on high] until they acknowledge their offense and feel their guilt and seek My face; in their affliction and distress they will seek inquire for and require Me earnestly saying
Hosea,6,1,COME AND let us return to the Lord for He has torn so that He may heal us; He has stricken so that He may bind us up.
Hosea,6,2,After two days He will revive us (quicken us give us life); on the third day He will raise us up that we may live before Him.
Hosea,6,3,Yes let us know (recognize be acquainted with and understand) Him; let us be zealous to know the Lord [to appreciate give heed to and cherish Him]. His going forth is prepared and certain as the dawn and He will come to us as the [heavy] rain as the latter rain that waters the earth.
Hosea,6,4,O Ephraim what shall I do with you? [says the Lord] O Judah what shall I do with you? For your [wavering] love and kindness are like the night mist or like the dew that goes early away.
Hosea,6,5,Therefore have I hewn down and smitten them by means of the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; My judgments [pronounced upon them by you prophets] are like the light that goes forth.
Hosea,6,6,For I desire and delight in dutiful steadfast love and goodness not sacrifice and the knowledge of and acquaintance with God more than burnt offerings.
Hosea,6,7,But they like [less-privileged] men and like Adam have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt faithlessly and treacherously with Me.
Hosea,6,8,Gilead is a city of evildoers; it is tracked with bloody [footprints].
Hosea,6,9,And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man so the company of priests murder on the road toward Shechem; yes they commit villainy and outrages.
Hosea,6,10,I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel! There harlotry and idolatry are found in Ephraim; Israel is defiled.
Hosea,6,11,Also O Judah there is a harvest [of divine judgment] appointed for you; when I would return My people from their captivity [in which they are slaves to the misery brought on by their own sins]
Hosea,7,1,WHEN I would heal Israel then Ephraim's guilt is uncovered and the wickedness of Samaria; how they practice falsehood and the thief enters and the troop of bandits ravage and raid without.
Hosea,7,2,But they do not consider and say to their minds and hearts that I [earnestly] remember all their wickedness. Now their own doings surround and entangle them; they are before My face.
Hosea,7,3,They make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies.
Hosea,7,4,They are all [idolatrous] adulterers; their passion smolders like heat of an oven when the baker ceases to stir the fire from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
Hosea,7,5,On the [special] day of our king the princes made themselves and him sick with the heat of wine; [the king] stretched out his hand with scoffers and lawless men.
Hosea,7,6,For they have made ready their heart and their mind burns [with intrigue] like an oven while they lie in wait. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes forth as a flaming fire.
Hosea,7,7,They are all hot as an oven and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen; there is none among them who calls to Me.
Hosea,7,8,Ephraim mixes himself among the peoples [courting the favor of first one country then another]; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Hosea,7,9,Strangers have devoured his strength and he knows it not; yes gray hairs are sprinkled here and there upon him and he does not know it.
Hosea,7,10,And the pride of Israel testifies against him and to his face. But they do not return to the Lord their God nor seek nor inquire of nor require Him in spite of all this.
Hosea,7,11,Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart or understanding; they call to Egypt; they go to Assyria.
Hosea,7,12,As they go I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the heavens. I will chastise them according to the announcement [or prediction made] to their congregation [in the Scriptures].
Hosea,7,13,Woe to them for they have wandered from Me! Destruction to them because they have rebelled and trespassed against Me! Though I would redeem them yet they have spoken lies against Me.
Hosea,7,14,They do not cry to Me from their heart but they wail upon their beds; they gash and distress and assemble themselves [in mourning] for grain and new wine; they rebel against Me.
Hosea,7,15,Although I have chastened them and trained and strengthened their arms yet they think and devise evil against Me.
Hosea,7,16,They turn back shift or change but not upwards [to the Most High]. They are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the insolence and rage of their tongue. This shall be [cause for] their derision and scorning in the land of Egypt.
Hosea,8,1,SET THE trumpet to your lips! [The enemy] comes as a [great] vulture against the house of the Lord because they have broken My covenant and transgressed against My law.
Hosea,8,2,Then they will cry to Me My God we [of Israel] know You!
Hosea,8,3,Israel has rejected the good [with loathing]; the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,They set up kings but not from Me [therefore without My blessing]; they have made princes or removed them [without consulting Me; therefore] I knew and recognized [them] not. With their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves that they [the silver and the gold] may be destroyed.
Hosea,8,5,Your calf [idol] O Samaria is loathsome and I have spurned it. My wrath burns against them. How long will it be before they attain purity?
Hosea,8,6,For this [calf] too is from Israel; a craftsman made it; therefore it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to shivers and go up in flames.
Hosea,8,7,For they sow the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it shall yield no meal; if it were to yield strangers and aliens would eat it up.
Hosea,8,8,Israel is [as if] swallowed up. Already they have become among the nations as a vessel [of cheap coarse pottery] that is useless.
Hosea,8,9,For they are gone up to Assyria a wild ass taking her own way by herself; Ephraim has hired lovers.
Hosea,8,10,Yes though with presents they hire [allies] among the nations now will I gather them up and in a little while they will sorrow and begin to diminish [their gifts] because of the burden (tribute) imposed by the king of princes [the king of Assyria].
Hosea,8,11,For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning; yes to him altars are intended for sinning.
Hosea,8,12,I wrote for him the ten thousand things of My law but they are counted as a strange thing [as something which does not concern him].
Hosea,8,13,My sacrificial gifts they sacrifice [as a mere form]; yes they sacrifice flesh and eat it but the Lord does not accept them. Now He will [earnestly] remember their guilt and iniquity and will punish their sins. They shall return to [another] Egypt [Assyria].
Hosea,8,14,For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces and idol temples and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour his palaces and fortified buildings.
Hosea,9,1,REJOICE NOT O Israel with exultation as do the peoples for you have played the harlot forsaking your God. You have loved [a harlot's] hire upon every threshing floor [ascribing the harvest to the Baals instead of to God].
Hosea,9,2,The threshing floor and the winevat shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail them.
Hosea,9,3,They shall not remain in the Lord's land but Ephraim shall return to [another] Egypt and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
Hosea,9,4,They shall not pour out wine offerings to the Lord neither shall they be pleasing to Him. Their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all who eat of them shall be defiled for their bread shall be [only] for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of the Lord [to be offered first to Him].
Hosea,9,5,What will you do on the day of the appointed solemn assembly or festival and on the day of the feast of the Lord [when you are in exile]?
Hosea,9,6,For behold they are gone away from devastation and destruction; Egypt shall gather them in; Memphis shall bury them. Their precious things of silver shall be in the possession of nettles; thorns shall be [growing] in their tents.
Hosea,9,7,The days of visitation and punishment have come; the days of recompense have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is [considered] a crazed fool and the man who is inspired is [treated as if] mad or a fanatic because of the abundance of your iniquity and because the enmity hostility and persecution are great.
Hosea,9,8,Ephraim was [intended to be] a watchman with my God [and a prophet to the surrounding nations]; but he that prophet has become a fowler's snare in all his ways. There is enmity hostility and persecution in the house of his God.
Hosea,9,9,They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. The Lord will [earnestly] remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins.
Hosea,9,10,I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree in its first season but they went to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to that shameful thing [Baal] and they became detestable and loathsome like that which they loved.
Hosea,9,11,As for Ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird; there shall be no birth no being with child and [because of their impurity] no becoming pregnant.
Hosea,9,12,Though they bring up their children yet will I bereave them so that not a man shall be left; yes woe also to them when I look away and depart from them!
Hosea,9,13,Ephraim as I have seen with Tyre is planted in a pleasant place but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.
Hosea,9,14,Give them [their due] O Lord! [But] what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
Hosea,9,15,All their wickedness [says the Lord] is focused in Gilgal for there I hated them; for the wickedness of their [idolatrous] doings I will drive them out of My house [the Holy Land]; I will love them no more; all their princes are rebels.
Hosea,9,16,Ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit. Yes though they bring forth yet will I slay even their beloved children.
Hosea,9,17,My God will cast them away because they did not listen to and obey Him and they shall be wanderers and fugitives among the nations.
Hosea,10,1,ISRAEL IS a luxuriant vine that puts forth its [material] fruit. According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars [to idols]; according to the goodness and prosperity of their land they have made goodly pillars or obelisks [to false gods].
Hosea,10,2,Their heart is divided and deceitful; now shall they be found guilty and suffer punishment. The Lord will smite and break down [the horns of] their altars; He will destroy their [idolatrous] pillars.
Hosea,10,3,Surely now they shall say We have no [actual] king because we fear not the Lord; and as for the king what can he do for us?
Hosea,10,4,They have spoken mere words of the lips swearing falsely in making covenants; therefore judgment springs up like hemlock [or other poisonous plants] in the furrows of the field.
Hosea,10,5,The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calf [idol] of Beth-aven [the house of idolatry contemptuously meaning Bethel] for its people shall mourn over it and its [idolatrous] priests who rejoiced over it [shall tremble] for the glory of [their calf god] because it is departed from it.
Hosea,10,6,[The golden calf] shall also be carried into Assyria as a tribute-gift to the fighting King Jareb; Ephraim shall be put to shame and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel [to set up calf worship and detach Israel from Judah].
Hosea,10,7,As for Samaria her king and her whole monarchy are cut off like twigs or foam upon the water.
Hosea,10,8,The high places also of Aven [once Beth(el) house of God now (Beth-)aven house of idolatry] the sin of Israel shall be destroyed; the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their [idol] altars and they shall say to the mountains Cover us! And to the hills Fall on us!
Hosea,10,9,O Israel you have [willfully] sinned from the days of Gibeah [when you all but wiped out the tribe of Benjamin]! There [Israel] stood [then only] that the battle against the sons of unrighteousness might not overtake and turn against them at Gibeah [but now the kingdom of the ten tribes and the name of Ephraim shall be utterly blotted out].
Hosea,10,10,When I please I will chastise them and hostile peoples shall be gathered against them when I shall bind and yoke them for their two transgressions [revolt from the Lord their God and the worship of idols].
Hosea,10,11,Ephraim indeed is a heifer broken in and loving to tread out the grain but I have [heretofore] spared the beauty of her fair neck. I will now set a rider upon Ephraim and make him to draw; Judah shall plow and Jacob shall break his clods.
Hosea,10,12,Sow for yourselves according to righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God); reap according to mercy and loving-kindness. Break up your uncultivated ground for it is time to seek the Lord to inquire for and of Him and to require His favor till He comes and teaches you righteousness and rains His righteous gift of salvation upon you.
Hosea,10,13,You have plowed and plotted wickedness you have reaped the [willful] injustice [of oppressors] you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your [own] way and your chariots in the multitude of your mighty men
Hosea,10,14,Therefore shall a tumult arise against your people and all your fortresses shall be wasted and destroyed as Shalmaneser wasted and destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
Hosea,10,15,So shall it be done to you at [idolatrous] Bethel because of your great wickedness; at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
Hosea,11,1,WHEN ISRAEL was a child then I loved him and called My son out of Egypt.
Hosea,11,2,The more [the prophets] called to them the more they went from them; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning incense to the graven images.
Hosea,11,3,Yet I taught Ephraim to walk taking them by their arms or taking them up in My arms but they did not know that I healed them.
Hosea,11,4,I drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and I was to them as one who lifts up and eases the yoke over their cheeks and I bent down to them and gently laid food before them.
Hosea,11,5,They shall not [literally] return into [another bondage in] the land of Egypt but the Assyrian shall be their king because they refused to return to Me.
Hosea,11,6,And the sword shall rage against and fall upon their cities and shall consume the bars of their gates and shall make an end [of their defenses] because of their own counsels and devices.
Hosea,11,7,My people are bent on backsliding from Me; though [the prophets] call them to Him Who is on high none at all will exalt Him or lift himself up [to come to Him].
Hosea,11,8,How can I give you up O Ephraim! How can I surrender you and cast you off O Israel! How can I make you as Admah or how can I treat you as Zeboiim [both destroyed with Sodom]! My heart recoils within Me; My compassions are kindled together.
Hosea,11,9,I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not bring back Ephraim to nothing or again destroy him. For I am God and not man the Holy One in the midst of you and I will not come in wrath or enter into the city.
Hosea,11,10,They shall walk after the Lord Who will roar like a lion; He Himself will roar and [His] sons shall come trembling and eagerly from the west.
Hosea,11,11,They shall come trembling but hurriedly like a bird out of Egypt and like a dove out of the land of Assyria and I will cause them to dwell in their houses says the Lord.
Hosea,11,12,Ephraim surrounds Me with lies and the house of Israel with deceit and Judah is not yet steadfast with God with the faithful Holy One.
Hosea,12,1,EPHRAIM HERDS and feeds on the wind and pursues the [parching] east wind; every day he increases lies and violence and a covenant is made with Assyria and oil is carried to Egypt.
Hosea,12,2,The Lord has also a controversy (a pleading contention) with Judah and will punish Jacob by visiting upon him according to his ways; according to his doings will He recompense him.
Hosea,12,3,He took his brother by the heel in [their mother's] womb and in the strength [of his manhood] he contended and had power with God.
Hosea,12,4,Yes he had power over the Angel [of the Lord] and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor. He met Him in Bethel and there [God] spoke with [him and through him with] us--
Hosea,12,5,Even the Lord the God of hosts the name of Him [Who spoke with Jacob] is the Lord.
Hosea,12,6,Therefore return to your God! Hold fast to love and mercy to righteousness and justice and wait [expectantly] for your God continually!
Hosea,12,7,Canaan [Israel--whose ideals have sunk to those of Canaan] is a trader; the balances of deceit are in his hand; he loves to oppress and defraud.
Hosea,12,8,Ephraim has said Ah but I have become rich; I have gained for myself wealth. All my profits shall bring on me no iniquity that would be sin. [But all his profits will never offset nor suffice to expiate the guilt which he has incurred.]
Hosea,12,9,But I [Who] am the Lord your God from [when you became a nation in] the land of Egypt will yet make you to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointed and solemn Feast [of Tabernacles].
Hosea,12,10,I have also spoken to [you by] the prophets and I have multiplied visions [for you] and [have appealed to you] through parables acted out by the prophets.
Hosea,12,11,If Gilead is given over to idolatry they shall come to nought and be mere waste; if they [insult God by] sacrificing bullocks in Gilgal [on heathen altars] their altars shall be like heaps in the furrows of the fields.
Hosea,12,12,Jacob fled into the open country of Aram or Padan-aram and [there] Israel served for a wife and for a wife he herded sheep.
Hosea,12,13,And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet was [Israel] preserved.
Hosea,12,14,Ephraim has provoked most bitter anger; therefore shall his blood [guilt] be left upon him and his disgrace and reproach shall his Lord return upon him.
Hosea,13,1,WHEN EPHRAIM spoke with trembling he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended and became guilty in Baal worship he died [spiritually and then outward ruin came also sealing Israel's doom as a nation].
Hosea,13,2,And now they sin more and more and have made for themselves molten images of their silver even idols according to their own understanding [as it pleased them] all of them the work of the craftsmen. To these [very works of their hands] they speak or pray who sacrifice to them; they kiss and show homage to the calves [as if they were alive]!
Hosea,13,3,Therefore they shall be like the morning mist or like the dew that passes early away like the chaff that swirls with the whirlwind from the threshing floor and as the smoke out of the chimney or through the window.
Hosea,13,4,Yet I am the Lord your God from [the time you became a nation in] the land of Egypt and you shall know or recognize no God but Me for there is no Savior besides Me.
Hosea,13,5,I knew (recognized understood and had regard for) you in the wilderness in the land of great drought.
Hosea,13,6,According to their pasture so were they filled [when they fed they grew full] and their heart was lifted up; therefore have they forgotten Me.
Hosea,13,7,Therefore I have become to them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk by the way [to Assyria] and watch them.
Hosea,13,8,I will meet them like a bear that is robbed of her cubs and I will rend the covering of their heart and there will I devour them like a lioness as a wild beast would tear them.
Hosea,13,9,It is your destruction O Israel that you have been against Me for in Me is your help.
Hosea,13,10,Where now is your king that he may save you in all your cities? And your judges of whom you said Give me a king and princes?
Hosea,13,11,I have given you a king in My anger and I have taken him away in My wrath.
Hosea,13,12,The iniquity of Ephraim [not fully punished yet] is bound up [as in a bag]; his sin is laid up in store [for judgment and destruction].
Hosea,13,13,The pains of a woman in childbirth are coming on for him [to be born]; but he is an unwise son for now when it is time [to be born] he comes not to the place where [unborn] children break forth [he needs new birth but makes no effort to acquire it].
Hosea,13,14,Should I ransom them from the power of Sheol (the place of the dead)? Should I redeem them from death? O death where are your plagues? O Sheol where is your destruction? Relenting and compassion are hidden from My eyes.
Hosea,13,15,For though among his brethren [his fellow tribes] he may be fruitful an east wind [Assyria] will come the breath of the Lord rising from the desert; and Ephraim's spring shall become dry and his fountain be dried up. [Assyria] shall plunder his treasury of every precious vessel.
Hosea,13,16,Samaria shall bear her guilt and become desolate for she rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their pregnant women shall be ripped up.
Hosea,14,1,O ISRAEL return to the Lord your God for you have stumbled and fallen [visited by calamity] due to your iniquity.
Hosea,14,2,Take with you words and return to the Lord. Say to Him Take away all our iniquity; accept what is good and receive us graciously; so will we render [our thanks] as bullocks [to be sacrificed] and pay the confession of our lips.
Hosea,14,3,Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses neither will we say any more to the work of our hands [idols] You are our gods. For in You [O Lord] the fatherless find love pity and mercy.
Hosea,14,4,I will heal their faithlessness; I will love them freely for My anger is turned away from [Israel].
Hosea,14,5,I will be like the dew and the night mist to Israel; he shall grow and blossom like the lily and cast forth his roots like [the sturdy evergreens of] Lebanon.
Hosea,14,6,His suckers and shoots shall spread and his beauty shall be like the olive tree and his fragrance like [the cedars and aromatic shrubs of] Lebanon.
Hosea,14,7,They that dwell under his shade shall return; they shall revive like the grain and blossom like the vine; the scent of it shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
Hosea,14,8,Ephraim shall say What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered [him] and will regard and watch over him; I am like a green fir or cypress tree; with Me is the fruit found [which is to nourish you].
Hosea,14,9,Who is wise that he may understand these things? Prudent that he may know them? For the ways of the Lord are right and the [uncompromisingly] just shall walk in them but transgressors shall stumble and fall in them.
Joel,1,1,THE WORD of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
Joel,1,2,Hear this you aged men and give ear all you inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing as this occurred in your days or even in the days of your fathers?
Joel,1,3,Tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation.
Joel,1,4,What the crawling locust left the swarming locust has eaten; and what the swarming locust left the hopping locust has eaten; and what the hopping locust left the stripping locust has eaten.
Joel,1,5,Awake you drunkards and weep; wail all you drinkers of wine because of the [fresh] sweet juice [of the grape] for it is cut off and removed from your mouth.
Joel,1,6,For a [heathen and hostile] nation [of locusts illustrative of a human foe] has invaded My land mighty and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion and it has the jaw teeth of a lioness.
Joel,1,7,It has laid waste My vine [symbol of God's people] and barked and broken My fig tree; it has made them completely bare and thrown them down; their branches are made white.
Joel,1,8,Lament like a virgin [bride] girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth [who has died].
Joel,1,9,The meal or cereal offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests the Lord's ministers mourn.
Joel,1,10,The field is laid waste the ground mourns; for the grain is destroyed the new juice [of the grape] is dried up the oil fails.
Joel,1,11,Be ashamed O you tillers of the soil; wail O you vinedressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field has perished.
Joel,1,12,The vine is dried up and the fig tree fails; the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple or quince tree even all the trees of the field are withered so that joy has withered and fled away from the sons of men.
Joel,1,13,Gird yourselves and lament you priests; wail you ministers of the altar; come lie all night in sackcloth you ministers of my [Joel's] God for the cereal or meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
Joel,1,14,Sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land in the house of the Lord your God and cry to the Lord [in penitent pleadings].
Joel,1,15,Alas for the day! For the day of [the judgment of] the Lord is at hand and as a destructive tempest from the Almighty will it come.
Joel,1,16,Is not the food cut off before our eyes joy and gladness from the house of our God?
Joel,1,17,The seed [grain] rots and shrivels under the clods the garners are desolate and empty the barns are in ruins because the grain has failed.
Joel,1,18,How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed and huddle together because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment (are forsaken and made wretched).
Joel,1,19,O Lord to You will I cry for the fire has devoured the pastures and folds of the plain and the wilderness and flame has burned all the trees of the field.
Joel,1,20,Even the wild beasts of the field pant and cry to You for the water brooks are dried up and fire has consumed the pastures and folds of the wilderness and the plain.
Joel,2,1,BLOW THE trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on My holy Mount [Zion]. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of [the judgment of] the Lord is coming; it is close at hand--
Joel,2,2,A day of darkness and gloom a day of clouds and of thick mists and darkness like the morning dawn spread upon the mountains; so there comes a [heathen hostile] people numerous and mighty the like of which has never been before and shall not be again even to the years of many generations.
Joel,2,3,A fire devours before them and behind them a flame burns; the land is as the garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes and none has escaped [the ravages of the devouring hordes].
Joel,2,4,Their appearance is like the appearance of horses and like war horses and horsemen so do they run.
Joel,2,5,Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap--like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble like a mighty people set in battle array.
Joel,2,6,Before them the peoples are in anguish; all faces become pale.
Joel,2,7,They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war. They march each one [straight ahead] on his ways and they do not break their ranks.
Joel,2,8,Neither does one thrust upon another; they walk every one in his path. And they burst through and upon the weapons yet they are not wounded and do not change their course.
Joel,2,9,They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up on and into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.
Joel,2,10,The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel,2,11,And the Lord utters His voice before His army for His host is very great and [they are] strong and powerful who execute [God's] word. For the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who can endure it?
Joel,2,12,Therefore also now says the Lord turn and keep on coming to Me with all your heart with fasting with weeping and with mourning [until every hindrance is removed and the broken fellowship is restored].
Joel,2,13,Rend your hearts and not your garments and return to the Lord your God for He is gracious and merciful slow to anger and abounding in loving-kindness; and He revokes His sentence of evil [when His conditions are met].
Joel,2,14,Who knows but what He will turn revoke your sentence [of evil] and leave a blessing behind Him [giving you the means with which to serve Him] even a cereal or meal offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?
Joel,2,15,Blow the trumpet in Zion; set apart a fast [a day of restraint and humility]; call a solemn assembly.
Joel,2,16,Gather the people sanctify the congregation; assemble the elderly people gather the children and the nursing infants; let the bridegroom [who is legally exempt from attending] go forth from his chamber and the bride out of her closet. [None is exempt from the humiliation.]
Joel,2,17,Let the priests the ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the altar; and let them say Have pity and spare Your people O Lord and give not Your heritage to reproach that the [heathen] nations should rule over them or use a byword against them. Why should they say among the peoples Where is their God?
Joel,2,18,Then was the Lord jealous for His land and had pity on His people.
Joel,2,19,Yes the Lord answered and said to His people Behold I am sending you grain and juice [of the grape] and oil and you shall be satisfied with them; and I will no more make you a reproach among the [heathen] nations.
Joel,2,20,But I will remove far off from you the northern [destroyer's] army and will drive it into a land barren and desolate with its front toward the eastern [Dead] Sea and with its rear toward the western [Mediterranean] Sea. And its stench shall come up [like that of a decaying mass of locusts a symbol and forecast of the fate of the northern army in the final day of the Lord] and its foul odor shall come up because He has done great things [the Lord will have destroyed the invaders]!
Joel,2,21,Fear not O land; be glad and rejoice for the Lord has done great things!
Joel,2,22,Be not afraid you wild beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness have sprung up and are green; the tree bears its fruit and the fig tree and the vine yield their [full] strength.
Joel,2,23,Be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God; for He gives you the former or early rain in just measure and in righteousness and He causes to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain as before.
Joel,2,24,And the [threshing] floors shall be full of grain and the vats shall overflow with juice [of the grape] and oil.
Joel,2,25,And I will restore or replace for you the years that the locust has eaten--the hopping locust the stripping locust and the crawling locust My great army which I sent among you.
Joel,2,26,And you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God Who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never be put to shame.
Joel,2,27,And you shall know understand and realize that I am in the midst of Israel and that I the Lord am your God and there is none else. My people shall never be put to shame.
Joel,2,28,And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions.
Joel,2,29,Even upon the menservants and upon the maidservants in those days will I pour out My Spirit.
Joel,2,30,And I will show signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and columns of smoke.
Joel,2,31,The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.
Joel,2,32,And whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered and saved for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape as the Lord has said and among the remnant [of survivors] shall be those whom the Lord calls.
Joel,3,1,FOR BEHOLD in those days and at that time when I shall reverse the captivity and restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem
Joel,3,2,I will gather all nations and will bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat and there will I deal with and execute judgment upon them for [their treatment of] My people and of My heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the nations and [because] they have divided My land.
Joel,3,3,And they have cast lots for My people and have given a boy for a harlot and have sold a girl for juice [of the grape] and have drunk it.
Joel,3,4,Yes and what are you to Me O Tyre and Sidon and all the [five small] divisions of Philistia? Will you pay Me back for something? Even if you pay Me back swiftly and speedily I will return your deed [of retaliation] upon your own head
Joel,3,5,Because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried into your temples and palaces My precious treasures
Joel,3,6,And have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians that you may remove them far from their border.
Joel,3,7,Behold I will stir them up out of the place to which you have sold them and will return your deed [of retaliation] upon your own head.
Joel,3,8,I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah and they will sell them to the Sabeans to a nation far off for the Lord has spoken it.
Joel,3,9,Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war! Stir up the mighty men! Let all the men of war draw near let them come up.
Joel,3,10,Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say I am strong [a warrior]!
Joel,3,11,Hasten and come all you nations round about and assemble yourselves; there You O Lord will bring down Your mighty ones (Your warriors).
Joel,3,12,Let the nations bestir themselves and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.
Joel,3,13,Put in the sickle for the [vintage] harvest is ripe; come get down and tread the grapes for the winepress is full; the vats overflow for the wickedness [of the peoples] is great.
Joel,3,14,Multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.
Joel,3,15,The sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel,3,16,The Lord will thunder and roar from Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be a refuge for His people and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
Joel,3,17,So shall you know understand and realize that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion My holy mountain. Then shall Jerusalem be holy and strangers and foreigners [not born into the family of God] shall no more pass through it.
Joel,3,18,And in that day the mountains shall drip with fresh juice [of the grape] and the hills shall flow with milk; and all the brooks and riverbeds of Judah shall flow with water and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and shall water the Valley of Shittim.
Joel,3,19,Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness for their violence against the children of Judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
Joel,3,20,But Judah shall remain and be inhabited forever and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
Joel,3,21,And I will cleanse and hold as innocent their blood and avenge it blood which I have not cleansed held innocent and avenged for the Lord dwells in Zion.
Amos,1,1,THE WORDS of Amos who was among the herdsmen and sheep masters of Tekoa which he saw [in divine revelation] concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel two years before the earthquake.
Amos,1,2,And he said The Lord roars out of Zion and utters His voice from Jerusalem; then the pastures of the shepherds mourn and the top of [Mount] Carmel dries up.
Amos,1,3,Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Damascus [the capital of Syria] and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because they have threshed Gilead [east of the Jordan River] with iron sledges.

Amos,1,6,Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Gaza [a city in Philistia] and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because [as slave traders] they carried away captive the whole [Jewish] population [of defenseless Judean border villages of which none was spared none left behind] and delivered them up to Edom [for the slave trade].
Amos,1,7,So I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza which shall devour its strongholds.
Amos,1,8,And I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon and I will turn My hand against Ekron; and the rest of the Philistines [in Gath and the towns dependent on these four Philistine cities] shall perish says the Lord God.
Amos,1,9,Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Tyre and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because they [as middlemen] delivered up a whole [Jewish] population to Edom and did not [seriously] remember their brotherly covenant.
Amos,1,10,So I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre which shall devour its strongholds.
Amos,1,11,Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Edom [descendants of Esau] and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because he pursued his brother Jacob (Israel) with the sword corrupting his compassions and casting off all pity and his anger tore perpetually and his wrath he kept and heeded forever.

Amos,1,14,So I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah [in Ammon] and it shall devour the strongholds of it with shouting in the day of battle with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
Amos,1,15,And their king shall go into exile he and his princes together says the Lord.
Amos,2,1,THUS SAYS the Lord: For three transgressions of Moab [descendants of Lot] and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because he burned the bones of the king of Edom [Esau's descendant] into lime.

Amos,2,3,And I will cut off the ruler from its midst and will slay all its princes with him says the Lord.
Amos,2,4,Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Judah and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because they have despised and rejected the law of the Lord and have not kept His commandments but their lies after which their fathers have walked caused them to err and go astray.
Amos,2,5,So I will send a fire upon Judah and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.
Amos,2,6,Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Israel and for four [for multiplied delinquencies] I will not reverse the punishment of it or revoke My word concerning it because they have sold the [strictly] just and uncompromisingly righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals;
Amos,2,7,They pant after [the sight of] the poor [reduced to such misery that they will be throwing] dust of the earth on their heads [in token of their grief]; they defraud and turn aside the humble [who are too meek to defend themselves]; and a man and his father will have sexual relations with the same maiden so that My holy name is profaned.
Amos,2,8,And they lay themselves down beside every [pagan] altar upon clothes they have taken in pledge [for indebtedness] and in the house of their God [in daring contempt of Him] they frivolously drink the wine which has been exacted from those [unjustly] fined.
Amos,2,9,Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them whose height was like the height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.
Amos,2,10,Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the Amorite.
Amos,2,11,And I raised up some of your sons for prophets and some of your young men for dedicated ones [Nazirites]. Is this not true O you children of Israel? says the Lord.
Amos,2,12,But you gave the dedicated ones [the Nazirites] wine to drink and commanded the prophets saying Prophesy not.
Amos,2,13,Behold I am pressed under you and I will press you down in your place as a cart presses that is full of sheaves.
Amos,2,14,And flight shall be lost to the swift and refuge shall fail him; the strong shall not retain and confirm his strength neither shall the mighty deliver himself.
Amos,2,15,Neither shall he stand who handles the bow and he who is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver his life.
Amos,2,16,And he who is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked on that day says the Lord.
Amos,3,1,HEAR THIS word that the Lord has spoken against you O children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt:
Amos,3,2,You only have I known (chosen sympathized with and loved) of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your wickedness and punish you for all your iniquities.
Amos,3,3,Do two walk together except they make an appointment and have agreed?
Amos,3,4,Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den if he has taken nothing?
Amos,3,5,Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where there is no trap for him? Does a trap spring up from the ground when nothing at all has sprung it?
Amos,3,6,Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be alarmed and afraid? Shall misfortune or evil occur [as punishment] and the Lord has not caused it?
Amos,3,7,Surely the Lord God will do nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets.
Amos,3,8,The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who can but prophesy?
Amos,3,9,Publish to the strongholds in Ashdod [Philistia] and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt and say Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria and behold what great tumults (confusion and disorder) are in her and what oppressions are in the midst of her.
Amos,3,10,For they know not how to do right says the Lord they who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds.
Amos,3,11,Therefore thus says the Lord God: An adversary shall surround the land and he shall bring down your defenses from you and your strongholds shall be plundered.
Amos,3,12,Thus says the Lord: As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear [of a sheep] so shall the children of Israel who dwell in Samaria be rescued with the corner of a couch and [part of] the damask covering of a bed.
Amos,3,13,Hear and bear witness in the house of Jacob says the Lord God the God of hosts
Amos,3,14,That in the day when I visit Israel's transgressions upon him I will also visit [with punishment] the altars of Bethel [with its golden calf] and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground.
Amos,3,15,And I will smite the winter house with the summer house and the houses of ivory shall perish and the many and great houses shall come to an end says the Lord.
Amos,4,1,HEAR THIS word you cows [women] of Bashan who are in the mountain of Samaria who oppress the poor who crush the needy who say to their husbands Bring and let us drink!
Amos,4,2,The Lord God has sworn by His holiness that behold the days shall come upon you when they shall take you away with hooks and the last of you with fishhooks.
Amos,4,3,And you shall go out through the breaches [made in the city's wall] every [woman] straight before her and you shall be cast forth into Harmon [an unknown place of exile] says the Lord.
Amos,4,4,Come to Bethel [where the golden calf is] and transgress; at Gilgal [another idol worship center] multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes every three days.
Amos,4,5,And offer [by burning] a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened and proclaim and publish freewill offerings for this you like to do O children of Israel! says the Lord God.
Amos,4,6,I also gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places; yet you did not return to Me says the Lord.
Amos,4,7,And also I withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest. I caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece of ground was rained upon and the piece upon which it did not rain withered.
Amos,4,8,So [the people of] two or three cities wandered and staggered into one city to drink water but they were not satisfied; yet you did not return to Me says the Lord.
Amos,4,9,I smote you with blight [from the poisonous east wind] and with mildew; I laid waste the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards; your fig trees and your olive trees the palmerworm [a form of locust] devoured; yet you did not return to Me says the Lord.
Amos,4,10,I have sent among you the pestilence [which I made] epidemic in Egypt; your young men I slew with the sword and I took into exile your horses and I made the stench of your camp come up into your nostrils; yet you did not return to Me says the Lord.
Amos,4,11,I have overthrown some among you as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet you did not return to Me says the Lord.
Amos,4,12,Therefore thus will I do to you O Israel; and because I will do this to you prepare to meet your God O Israel!
Amos,4,13,For behold He Who forms the mountains and creates the wind and declares to man what is his thought Who makes the morning darkness and treads on the heights of the earth--the Lord the God of hosts is His name!
Amos,5,1,HEAR THIS word which I take up concerning you in lamentation O house of Israel:
Amos,5,2,The Virgin of Israel has fallen; she shall no more rise; she lies cast down and forsaken on her land; there is no one to raise her up.
Amos,5,3,For thus says the Lord God: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.
Amos,5,4,For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek Me [inquire for and of Me and require Me as you require food] and you shall live!
Amos,5,5,But seek not [the golden calf at] Bethel nor enter into [idolatrous] Gilgal and pass not over to [the idols of] Beersheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity and exile and Bethel [house of God] shall become Beth-aven [house of vanity emptiness falsity and futility] and come to nothing.
Amos,5,6,Seek the Lord [inquire for and of Him and require Him] and you shall live lest He rush down like fire upon the house of Joseph [representing the ten tribes] and devour it and there be none to quench it in Bethel [the center of their idol hopes].
Amos,5,7,You who turn justice into [the bitterness of] wormwood and cast righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God) down to the ground
Amos,5,8,Seek Him Who made the [cluster of stars called] Pleiades and [the constellation] Orion Who turns the shadow of death or deep darkness into the morning and darkens the day into night Who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth--the Lord is His name--
Amos,5,9,Who causes sudden destruction to flash forth upon the strong so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
Amos,5,10,They hate him who reproves in the [city] gate [holding him as an abomination and rejecting his rebuke] and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.
Amos,5,11,Therefore because you tread upon the poor and take from him exactions of wheat you have built houses of hewn stone but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards but you shall not drink their wine.
Amos,5,12,For I know how manifold are your transgressions and how mighty are your sins--you who afflict the [uncompromisingly] righteous who take a bribe and who turn aside the needy in the [court of the city] gate from their right.
Amos,5,13,Therefore he who is prudent will keep silence in such a time for it is an evil time.
Amos,5,14,Seek (inquire for and require) good and not evil that you may live and so the Lord the God of hosts will be with you as you have said.
Amos,5,15,Hate the evil and love the good and establish justice in the [court of the city's] gate. It may be that the Lord the God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph [the northern kingdom].
Amos,5,16,Therefore thus says the Lord the God of hosts the Lord: There shall be wailing in all the broad ways and in all the streets they shall say Alas! Alas! And they shall call the farmers to mourning and such as are skilled in lamentation to wailing.
Amos,5,17,And in all vineyards there shall be wailing for I will pass through the midst of you says the Lord.
Amos,5,18,Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord! Why would you want the day of the Lord? It is darkness and not light;
Amos,5,19,It is as if a man fled from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned with his hand against the wall and a serpent bit him.
Amos,5,20,Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness not light? Even very dark with no brightness in it?
Amos,5,21,I hate I despise your feasts and I will not smell a savor or take delight in your solemn assemblies.
Amos,5,22,Though you offer Me your burnt offerings and your cereal offerings I will not accept them neither will I look upon the peace or thank offerings of your fatted beasts.
Amos,5,23,Take away from Me the noise of your songs for I will not listen to the melody of your harps.
Amos,5,24,But let justice run down like waters and righteousness as a mighty and ever-flowing stream.
Amos,5,25,Did you bring to Me sacrifices and cereal offerings during those forty years in the wilderness O house of Israel?
Amos,5,26,[No] but [instead of bringing Me the appointed sacrifices] you carried about the tent of your king Sakkuth and Kaiwan [names for the gods of the planet Saturn] your images of your star-god which you made for yourselves [and you will do so again].
Amos,5,27,Therefore I will cause you to go into exile beyond Damascus says the Lord whose name is the God of hosts.
Amos,6,1,WOE TO those who are at ease in Zion and to those on the mountain of Samaria who are careless and feel secure the notable men of the chief [because chosen by God] of the nations to whom the house of Israel comes!
Amos,6,2,Pass over to Calneh and see and from there go to Hamath the great [city north of Damascus]; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these [your] kingdoms? Or are their boundaries greater than your boundaries
Amos,6,3,O you who put far away the evil day [of punishment] yet cause the sitting of violence [upon you] to come near?
Amos,6,4,Woe to those who lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall
Amos,6,5,Who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp and invent for themselves instruments of music like David's
Amos,6,6,Who drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the finest oils but are not grieved and sick at heart over the affliction and ruin of Joseph (Israel)!
Amos,6,7,Therefore now shall they go captive with the first who go into exile and the revelry and banqueting of those who stretch themselves shall be ended.
Amos,6,8,The Lord God has sworn by Himself--the Lord the God of hosts says: I abhor reject and despise the pride and false futile glory of Jacob (Israel) and I hate his palaces and strongholds; and I will deliver up the city [idol-worshiping Samaria] with all that is in it.
Amos,6,9,And it shall come to pass that if there remain ten men in one house they shall die [by the pestilence that comes with war].
Amos,6,10,And then a man's uncle or kinsman he who is to make a burning to cremate and dispose [of his pestilence-infected body] comes in to bring the bones out of the house and he shall say to another still alive in the farthest parts of the house Is there anyone else with you? and he shall say No. Then shall the newcomer say Hush! Hold your [cursing] tongue! We dare not so mention the name of the Lord [lest we invoke more punishment].
Amos,6,11,For behold the Lord commands and He will smite the great house into ruins and the little house into fragments.
Amos,6,12,Do horses run upon rocks? Do men plow the ocean with oxen? But you have turned justice into [the poison of] gall and the fruit of righteousness into [the bitterness of] wormwood--
Amos,6,13,You who rejoice in Lo-debar [a thing of nought] who say Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim or horns [of resistance] for ourselves?
Amos,6,14,For behold I will raise up against you a nation O house of Israel says the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall afflict and oppress you [to the entire limits of Israel] from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.
Amos,7,1,THUS THE Lord God showed me [Amos] and behold He formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the second crop and behold it was the second crop after the king's mowings.
Amos,7,2,And when [the locusts] had finished eating the plants of the land then I said O Lord God forgive I pray You. How can Jacob stand? For he is so small!
Amos,7,3,The Lord relented and revoked this sentence: It shall not take place said the Lord [and He was eased and comforted concerning it].
Amos,7,4,Thus the Lord God showed me and behold the Lord God called for punishment with fire and it devoured the great deep and would have eaten up the land.
Amos,7,5,Then said I O Lord God cease I pray You! How can Jacob stand? He is so little!
Amos,7,6,The Lord relented and revoked this sentence: This also shall not be said the Lord [and He was eased and comforted concerning it].
Amos,7,7,Thus He showed me and behold the Lord stood upon a wall with a plumb line with a plumb line in His hand.
Amos,7,8,And the Lord said to me Amos what do you see? And I said A plumb line. Then said the Lord Behold I am setting a plumb line as a standard in the midst of My people Israel. I will not pass by and spare them any more [the door of mercy is shut].
Amos,7,9,And the [idolatrous] high places of Isaac (Israel) shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise with the sword against the house of King Jeroboam [who set up the golden calf shrines].
Amos,7,10,Then Amaziah the priest of [the golden calf shrine at] Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.
Amos,7,11,For thus Amos has said Jeroboam shall die by the sword and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
Amos,7,12,Also Amaziah said to Amos O you seer go! Flee back to the land of Judah [your own country] and eat your bread and live out your profession as a prophet there [as I perform my duties here].
Amos,7,13,But do not prophesy any more at Bethel for it is the king's sanctuary and a seat of his kingdom.
Amos,7,14,Then Amos said to Amaziah I was no prophet [by profession]! Neither was I a prophet's son; [but I had my occupation] I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore trees and a gatherer of sycamore figs.
Amos,7,15,And the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the Lord said to me Go prophesy to My people Israel.
Amos,7,16,Now therefore listen to the word of the Lord: You say Do not prophesy against Israel and drop no statements not complimentary to the house of Isaac.
Amos,7,17,Therefore thus says the Lord: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword and your land shall be divided up by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean and defiled land and Israel shall surely go forth out of his land into exile.
Amos,8,1,THUS THE Lord God showed to me and behold a basket of [ripe and therefore soon to perish] summer fruit.
Amos,8,2,And He said Amos what do you see? And I said A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord to me The end has come upon My people Israel; I will not pass by and spare them any more.
Amos,8,3,And the songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day says the Lord God. The dead bodies shall be many; in every place they shall be cast forth in silence.
Amos,8,4,Hear this O you who would swallow up and trample down the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail and come to an end
Amos,8,5,Saying When will the New Moon festival be past that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath that we may offer wheat for sale making the ephah [measure] small and the shekel [measure] great and falsifying the scales by deceit
Amos,8,6,That we may buy [into slavery] the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals; yes and sell the refuse of the wheat [as if it were good grade]?
Amos,8,7,The Lord has sworn by [Himself Who is] the Glory and Pride of Jacob Surely I will never forget any of their [rebellious] deeds.
Amos,8,8,Shall not the land tremble on this account and everyone mourn who dwells in it? Yes it shall rise like the river [Nile] all of it and it shall be tossed about and sink back again to normal level as does the Nile of Egypt.
Amos,8,9,And in that day says the Lord God I will cause the sun to go down at noon and I will darken the earth in the broad daylight.
Amos,8,10,And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and I will cause sackcloth to be put upon all loins and baldness [for mourning] shall come on every head; and I will make that time as the mourning for an only son and the end of it as a bitter day.
Amos,8,11,Behold the days are coming says the Lord God when I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but [a famine] for hearing the words of the Lord.
Amos,8,12,And [the people] shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord [inquiring for and requiring it as one requires food] but shall not find it.
Amos,8,13,In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
Amos,8,14,Those who swear by Ashimah or the sin of Samaria and say By the life of your god [the golden calf] O Dan! and [swear] By the life of the way of [idolatrous] Beersheba they shall fall and rise no more.
Amos,9,1,I SAW the Lord standing at the altar and He said Smite the tops of the pillars until the thresholds tremble and shatter them on the heads of all of the people; and the remainder of them I will slay with the sword. He who flees of them shall not get away and he who escapes of them shall not be delivered.
Amos,9,2,Though they dig into Sheol (Hades the dark abode of the gathered dead) from there shall My hand take them; though they climb up to heaven [the abode of light] from there will I bring them down;
Amos,9,3,And though they hide themselves on the top of [Mount] Carmel from there I will search out and take them; and though they [try to] hide from My sight at the bottom of the sea there I will command the serpent and it shall bite them.
Amos,9,4,And though they go into captivity before their enemies there will I command the sword and it shall slay them and I will set My eyes upon them for evil and not for good.
Amos,9,5,The Lord God of hosts it is He Who touches the earth and it melts and all who dwell in it mourn; it shall rise like the [river] Nile all of it and it shall sink again like the Nile of Egypt.
Amos,9,6,It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heavens and Who founds His vault over the earth Who calls to the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth--The Lord is His name.
Amos,9,7,You [O degenerate children of Israel] are no more to Me than these [despised] Cushites says the Lord. I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt but have I not [also] brought the Philistines out of Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir?
Amos,9,8,Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom [of Israel's ten tribes] and I will destroy it from the surface of the ground except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob says the Lord.
Amos,9,9,For behold I will command and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations and cause it to move to and fro as grain is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth and be lost [from My sight].
Amos,9,10,All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword who say The evil shall not overtake or meet [and assail] us.
Amos,9,11,In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David the fallen hut or booth and close up its breaches; and I will raise up its ruins and I will build it as in the days of old
Amos,9,12,That they may possess the remnant of Edom and of all the nations that are called by My name says the Lord Who does this.
Amos,9,13,Behold the days are coming says the Lord that the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him who sows the seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt [that is everything heretofore barren and unfruitful shall overflow with spiritual blessing].
Amos,9,14,And I will bring back the exiles of My people Israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine from them; they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them.
Amos,9,15,And I will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be torn up out of their land which I gave them says the Lord your God.
Obadiah,1,1,THE VISION of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from the Lord and an ambassador is sent forth among the nations [saying] Arise and let us rise up against [Edom] for battle!
Obadiah,1,2,Behold I will make you small among the nations [Edom]; you shall be despised exceedingly.
Obadiah,1,3,The pride of your heart has deceived you you dweller in the refuges of the rock [Petra Edom's capital] whose habitation is high who says in his heart Who can bring me down to the ground?
Obadiah,1,4,Though you mount on high as the eagle and though you set your nest among the stars I will bring you down from there says the Lord.
Obadiah,1,5,If thieves came to you if robbers by night--how you are brought to nothing!--would they not steal only enough for themselves? If grape gatherers came to you would they not leave some grapes for gleaning? [But this ravaging was done by God not men.]
Obadiah,1,6,How are the things of Esau [Edom] searched out! How are his hidden treasures sought out!
Obadiah,1,7,All the men of your confederacy (your allies) have brought you on your way even to the border; the men who were at peace with you have deceived you and prevailed against you; they who eat your bread have laid a snare under you. There is no understanding [in Edom or] of it.
Obadiah,1,8,Will not I in that day says the Lord destroy the wise men out of Edom and [men of] understanding out of Mount Esau [Idumea a mountainous region]?
Obadiah,1,9,And your mighty men O Teman shall be dismayed to the end that everyone from Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter.
Obadiah,1,10,For the violence you did against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you and you shall be cut off forever.
Obadiah,1,11,On the day that you stood aloof [from your brother Jacob]--on the day that strangers took captive his forces and carried off his wealth and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem--you were even as one of them.
Obadiah,1,12,But you should not have gloated over your brother's day the day when his misfortune came and he was made a stranger; you should not have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day of their ruin; you should not have spoken arrogantly in the day of their distress.
Obadiah,1,13,You should not have entered the gate of My people in the day of their calamity and ruin; yes you should not have looked [with delight] on their misery in the day of their calamity and ruin and not have reached after their army and their possessions in the day of their calamity and ruin.
Obadiah,1,14,And you should not have stood at the crossway to cut off those of Judah who escaped neither should you have delivered up those [of Judah] who remained in the day of distress.
Obadiah,1,15,For the day of the Lord is near upon all the nations. As you have done it shall be done to you; your dealings will return upon your own head.
Obadiah,1,16,For as you [Edom] have drunk upon the mountain of My holiness [desecrating it in the wild revelry of the destroyers] so shall all the nations drink continually [in turn of My wrath]; yes they shall drink talk foolishly and swallow down [the full measure of punishment] and they shall be [destroyed] as though they had not been.
Obadiah,1,17,But on Mount Zion [in Jerusalem] there shall be deliverance [for those who escape] and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess its [own former] possessions.
Obadiah,1,18,The house of Jacob shall be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame but the house of Esau shall be stubble; they shall kindle and burn them and consume them and there shall be no survivor of the house of Esau for the Lord has spoken it.
Obadiah,1,19,They of the South (the Negeb) shall possess Mount Esau and they of the lowland the land of the Philistines; they shall possess the land of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria and Benjamin shall possess Gilead [across the Jordan River].
Obadiah,1,20,And the exiles of this host of the children of Israel who are among the Canaanites shall possess [Phoenicia] as far as Zarephath and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the South (the Negeb).
Obadiah,1,21,And deliverers shall go up on Mount Zion to rule and judge Mount Esau and the kingdom and the kingship shall be the Lord's.
Jonah,1,1,NOW THE word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai saying
Jonah,1,2,Arise go to Nineveh that great city and proclaim against it for their wickedness has come up before Me.
Jonah,1,3,But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from being in the presence of the Lord [as His prophet] and went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish [the most remote of the Phoenician trading places then known]. So he paid the appointed fare and went down into the ship to go with them to Tarshish from being in the presence of the Lord [as His servant and minister].
Jonah,1,4,But the Lord sent out a great wind upon the sea and there was a violent tempest on the sea so that the ship was about to be broken.
Jonah,1,5,Then the mariners were afraid and each man cried to his god; and they cast the goods that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep.
Jonah,1,6,So the captain came and said to him What do you mean you sleeper? Arise call upon your God! Perhaps your God will give a thought to us so that we shall not perish.
Jonah,1,7,And they each said to one another Come let us cast lots that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us. So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
Jonah,1,8,Then they said to him Tell us we pray you on whose account has this evil come upon us? What is your occupation? Where did you come from? And what is your country and nationality?
Jonah,1,9,And he said to them I am a Hebrew and I [reverently] fear and worship the Lord the God of heaven Who made the sea and the dry land.
Jonah,1,10,Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him What is this that you have done? For the men knew that he fled from being in the presence of the Lord [as His prophet and servant] because he had told them.
Jonah,1,11,Then they said to him What shall we do to you that the sea may subside and be calm for us? For the sea became more and more [violently] tempestuous.
Jonah,1,12,And [Jonah] said to them Take me up and cast me into the sea; so shall the sea become calm for you for I know that it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.
Jonah,1,13,Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship to the land but they could not for the sea became more and more violent against them.
Jonah,1,14,Therefore they cried to the Lord We beseech You O Lord we beseech You let us not perish for this man's life and lay not upon us innocent blood; for You O Lord have done as it pleased You.
Jonah,1,15,So they took up Jonah and cast him into the sea and the sea ceased from its raging.
Jonah,1,16,Then the men [reverently and worshipfully] feared the Lord exceedingly and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.
Jonah,1,17,Now the Lord had prepared and appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah,2,1,THEN JONAH prayed to the Lord his God from the fish's belly
Jonah,2,2,And said I cried out of my distress to the Lord and He heard me; out of the belly of Sheol cried I and You heard my voice.
Jonah,2,3,For You cast me into the deep into the heart of the seas and the floods surrounded me; all Your waves and Your billows passed over me.
Jonah,2,4,Then I said I have been cast out of Your presence and Your sight; yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.
Jonah,2,5,The waters compassed me about even to [the extinction of] life; the abyss surrounded me the seaweed was wrapped about my head.
Jonah,2,6,I went down to the bottoms and the very roots of the mountains; the earth with its bars closed behind me forever. Yet You have brought up my life from the pit and corruption O Lord my God.
Jonah,2,7,When my soul fainted upon me [crushing me] I earnestly and seriously remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to You into Your holy temple.
Jonah,2,8,Those who pay regard to false useless and worthless idols forsake their own [Source of] mercy and loving-kindness.
Jonah,2,9,But as for me I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation and deliverance belong to the Lord!
Jonah,2,10,And the Lord spoke to the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
Jonah,3,1,AND THE word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time saying
Jonah,3,2,Arise go to Nineveh that great city and preach and cry out to it the preaching that I tell you.
Jonah,3,3,So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city of three days' journey [sixty miles in circumference].
Jonah,3,4,And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown!
Jonah,3,5,So the people of Nineveh believed in God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth [in penitent mourning] from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
Jonah,3,6,For word came to the king of Nineveh [of all that had happened to Jonah and his terrifying message from God] and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe aside covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.
Jonah,3,7,And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste anything; let them not feed nor drink water.
Jonah,3,8,But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and let them cry mightily to God. Yes let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
Jonah,3,9,Who can tell God may turn and revoke His sentence against us [when we have met His terms] and turn away from His fierce anger so that we perish not.
Jonah,3,10,And God saw their works that they turned from their evil way; and God revoked His [sentence of] evil that He had said that He would do to them and He did not do it [for He was comforted and eased concerning them].
Jonah,4,1,BUT IT displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry.
Jonah,4,2,And he prayed to the Lord and said I pray You O Lord is not this just what I said when I was still in my country? That is why I fled to Tarshish for I knew that You are a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and [when sinners turn to You and meet Your conditions] You revoke the [sentence of] evil against them.
Jonah,4,3,Therefore now O Lord I beseech You take my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah,4,4,Then said the Lord Do you do well to be angry?
Jonah,4,5,So Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and he made a booth there for himself. He sat there under it in the shade till he might see what would become of the city.
Jonah,4,6,And the Lord God prepared a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah that it might be a shade over his head to deliver him from his evil situation. So Jonah was exceedingly glad [to have the protection] of the gourd.
Jonah,4,7,But God prepared a cutworm when the morning dawned the next day and it smote the gourd so that it withered.
Jonah,4,8,And when the sun arose God prepared a sultry east wind and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah so that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said It is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah,4,9,And God said to Jonah Do you do well to be angry for the loss of the gourd? And he said I do well to be angry angry enough to die!
Jonah,4,10,Then said the Lord You have had pity on the gourd for which you have not labored nor made it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night.
Jonah,4,11,And should not I spare Nineveh that great city in which there are more than 120000 persons not [yet old enough to] know their right hand from their left and also many cattle [not accountable for sin]?
Micah,1,1,THE WORD of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah which he saw [through divine revelation] concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Micah,1,2,Hear all you people; listen closely O earth and all that is in it and let the Lord God be witness among you and against you the Lord from His holy temple.
Micah,1,3,For behold the Lord comes forth out of His place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.
Micah,1,4,And the mountains shall melt under Him and the valleys shall be cleft like wax before the fire like waters poured down a steep place.
Micah,1,5,All this is because of the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not [the idol worship of] Samaria? And what are the high places [of idolatry] in Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?
Micah,1,6,Therefore I [the Lord] will make Samaria a heap in the open country a place for planting vineyards; and I will pour down into the ravine her stones and lay bare her foundations.
Micah,1,7,And all her carved images shall be broken in pieces and all her hires [all that man would gain from desertion of God] shall be burned with fire and all her idols will be laid waste; for from the hire of [one] harlot she gathered them and to the hire of [another] harlot they shall return.
Micah,1,8,Therefore I [Micah] will lament and wail; I will go stripped and [virtually] naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals and a lamentation like the ostriches.
Micah,1,9,For [Samaria's] wounds are incurable and they come even to Judah; He [the Lord] has reached to the gate of my people to Jerusalem.
Micah,1,10,In Gath [a city in Philistia] announce it not; in Acco weep not at all [betraying your grief to foreigners; but among your own people] in Beth-le-aphrah [house of dust] roll yourself in the dust.
Micah,1,11,Pass on your way [into exile] dwellers of Shaphir in shameful nakedness. The dwellers of Zaanan dare not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel takes away from you the place on which it stands.
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant of Maroth [bitterness] writhes in pain [at its losses] and waits anxiously for good because evil comes down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah,1,13,Bind the chariot to the swift steed O lady inhabitant of Lachish; you were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
Micah,1,14,Therefore you must give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath [Micah's home town]; the houses of Achzib [place of deceit] shall be a deception to the kings of Israel.
Micah,1,15,Yet will I bring a conqueror upon you O lady inhabitant of Mareshah who shall possess you; the glory and nobility of Israel shall come to Adullam [to hide in the caves as did David].
Micah,1,16,Make yourself bald in mourning and cut off your hair for the children of your delight; enlarge your baldness as the eagle for [your children] shall be carried from you into exile.
Micah,2,1,WOE TO those who devise iniquity and work out evil upon their beds! When the morning is light they perform and practice it because it is in their power.
Micah,2,2,They covet fields and seize them and houses and take them away; they oppress and crush a man and his house a man and his inheritance.
Micah,2,3,Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold against this family I am planning a disaster from which you cannot remove your necks nor will you be able to walk erect; for it will be an evil time.
Micah,2,4,In that day shall they take up a [taunting] parable against you and wail with a doleful and bitter lamentation and say We are utterly ruined and laid waste! [God] changes the portion of my people. How He removes it from me! He divides our fields [to the rebellious our captors].
Micah,2,5,Therefore you shall have no one to cast a line by lot upon a plot [of ground] in the assembly of the Lord.
Micah,2,6,Do not preach say the prophesying false prophets; one should not babble and harp on such things; disgrace will not overtake us [the reviling has no end].
Micah,2,7,O house of Jacob shall it be said Is the Spirit of the Lord restricted impatient and shortened? Or are these [prophesied plagues] His doings? Do not My words do good to him who walks uprightly?
Micah,2,8,But lately (yesterday) My people have stood up as an enemy [and have made Me their antagonist]. Off from the garment you strip the cloak of those who pass by in secure confidence of safety and are averse to war.
Micah,2,9,The women of My people you cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away My glory forever.
Micah,2,10,Arise and depart for this is not the rest [which was promised to the righteous in Canaan] because of uncleanness that works destruction even a sharp and grievous destruction.
Micah,2,11,If a man walking in a spirit [of vanity] and in falsehood should lie and say I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink O Israel he would even be the acceptable prophet of this people!
Micah,2,12,I will surely gather all of you O Jacob; I will surely collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them [Israel] together like sheep in a fold like a flock in the midst of their pasture. They [the fold and the pasture] shall swarm with men and hum with much noise.
Micah,2,13,The Breaker [the Messiah] will go up before them. They will break through pass in through the gate and go out through it and their King will pass on before them the Lord at their head.
Micah,3,1,AND I [Micah] said Hear I pray you you heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel! Is it not for you to know justice?--
Micah,3,2,You who hate the good and love the evil who pluck and steal the skin from off [My people] and their flesh from off their bones;
Micah,3,3,Yes you who eat the flesh of my people and strip their skin from off them who break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot like meat in a big kettle.
Micah,3,4,Then will they cry to the Lord but He will not answer them; He will even hide His face from them at that time because they have made their deeds evil.
Micah,3,5,Thus says the Lord: Concerning the false prophets who make My people err when they have anything good to bite with their teeth they cry Peace; and whoever gives them nothing to chew against him they declare a sanctified war.
Micah,3,6,Therefore it shall be night to you so that you shall have no vision; yes it shall be dark to you without divination. And the sun shall go down over the false prophets and the day shall be black over them.
Micah,3,7,And the seers shall be put to shame and the diviners shall blush and be confounded; yes they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer from God.
Micah,3,8,But truly I [Micah] am full of power of the Spirit of the Lord and of justice and might to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
Micah,3,9,Hear this I pray you you heads of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel who abhor and reject justice and pervert all equity
Micah,3,10,Who build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity.
Micah,3,11,Its heads judge for reward and a bribe and its priests teach for hire and its prophets divine for money; yet they lean on the Lord and say Is not the Lord among us? No evil can come upon us.
Micah,3,12,Therefore shall Zion on your account be plowed like a field Jerusalem shall become heaps [of ruins] and the mountain of the house [of the Lord] like a densely wooded height.
Micah,4,1,BUT IN the latter days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains; and it shall be exalted above the hills and peoples shall flow to it.
Micah,4,2,And many nations shall come and say Come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob that He may teach us His ways and we may walk in His paths. For the law shall go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
Micah,4,3,And He shall judge between many peoples and shall decide for strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more.
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken it.
Micah,4,5,For all the peoples [now] walk every man in the name of his god but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.
Micah,4,6,In that day says the Lord I will assemble the lame and I will gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted.
Micah,4,7,And I will make the lame a remnant and those who were cast off a strong nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forever.
Micah,4,8,And you O tower of the flock the hill and stronghold of the Daughter of Zion unto you the former dominion shall come the kingdom of the Daughter of Jerusalem.
Micah,4,9,Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished that pains have taken you like a woman in labor?
Micah,4,10,Writhe in pain and labor to bring forth O Daughter of Zion like a woman in childbirth; for now you shall go forth out of the city and you shall live in the open country. You shall go to Babylon; there you shall be rescued. There the Lord shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
Micah,4,11,Now many nations are assembled against you saying Let her be profaned and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.
Micah,4,12,But they know not the thoughts of the Lord neither do they understand His plan for He shall gather them as the sheaves to the threshing floor.
Micah,4,13,Arise and thresh O Daughter of Zion! For I will make your horn iron and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples and I will devote their gain to the Lord and their treasure to the Lord of all the earth.
Micah,5,1,NOW GATHER yourself in troops O daughter of troops; a state of siege has been placed against us. They shall smite the ruler of Israel with a rod (a scepter) on the cheek.
Micah,5,2,But you Bethlehem Ephratah you are little to be among the clans of Judah; [yet] out of you shall One come forth for Me Who is to be Ruler in Israel Whose goings forth have been from of old from ancient days (eternity).
Micah,5,3,Therefore shall He give them up until the time that she who travails has brought forth; then what is left of His brethren shall return to the children of Israel.
Micah,5,4,And He shall stand and feed His flock in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the Lord His God; and they shall dwell [secure] for then shall He be great [even] to the ends of the earth.
Micah,5,5,And this [One] shall be our peace. When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads upon our soil and in our palaces then will we raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes among men.
Micah,5,6,And they shall rule and waste the land of Assyria with the sword and the land of Nimrod within her [Assyria's own] gates. Thus shall He [the Messiah] deliver us from the Assyrian [representing the opposing powers] when he comes into our land and when he treads on our borders.
Micah,5,7,Then the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the Lord like showers upon the grass which [come suddenly and] tarry not for man nor wait for the sons of men.
Micah,5,8,And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest like a young lion [suddenly appearing] among the flocks of sheep which when it goes through treads down and tears in pieces and there is no deliverer.
Micah,5,9,Your hand will be lifted up above your adversaries and all your enemies shall be cut off.
Micah,5,10,And in that day says the Lord I will cut off your horses [on which you depend] from among you and will destroy your chariots.
Micah,5,11,And I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds.
Micah,5,12,And I will cut off witchcrafts and sorceries from your hand and you shall have no more soothsayers.
Micah,5,13,Your carved images also I will cut off and your statues or pillars out of your midst and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.
Micah,5,14,And I will root out your Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah] and I will destroy your cities [the seats of false worship].
Micah,5,15,And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance upon the nations which would not obey [vengeance such as they have not heard of before].
Micah,6,1,HEAR NOW what the Lord says: Arise contend and plead your case before the mountains and let the hills hear your voice.
Micah,6,2,Hear O mountains the Lord's controversy and you strong and enduring foundations of the earth for the Lord has a controversy (a pleading contention) with His people and He will [pleadingly] contend with Israel.
Micah,6,3,O My people what have I done to you? And in what have I wearied you? Testify against Me [answer Me]!
Micah,6,4,For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house where you were bond servants and I sent before you Moses Aaron and Miriam.
Micah,6,5,O My people [earnestly] remember now what Balak king of Moab devised and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember what the Lord did for you] from Shittim to Gilgal that you may know the righteous and saving acts of the Lord.
Micah,6,6,With what shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings with calves a year old?
Micah,6,7,Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Micah,6,8,He has showed you O man what is good. And what does the Lord require of you but to do justly and to love kindness and mercy and to humble yourself and walk humbly with your God?
Micah,6,9,The voice of the Lord calls to the city [Jerusalem]--and it is sound wisdom to hear and fear Your name--Hear (heed) the rod and Him Who has appointed it.
Micah,6,10,Are there not still treasures gained by wickedness in the house of the wicked and a scant measure [a false measure for grain] that is abominable and accursed?
Micah,6,11,Can I be pure [Myself and acquit the man] with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful weights?
Micah,6,12,For [the city's] rich men are full of violence; her inhabitants have spoken lies and their tongues are deceitful in their mouths.
Micah,6,13,Therefore I have also smitten you with a deadly wound and made you sick laying you desolate waste and deserted because of your sins.
Micah,6,14,You shall eat but not be satisfied and your emptiness and hunger shall remain in you; you shall carry away [goods and those you love] but fail to save them and those you do deliver I will give to the sword.
Micah,6,15,You shall sow but not reap; you shall tread olives but not anoint yourselves with oil and [you shall extract juice from] the grapes but not drink the wine.
Micah,6,16,For the statutes of [idolatrous] Omri you have kept and all the works of the house of [wicked] Ahab and you walk in their counsels. Therefore I will make you a desolation and an astonishment and your [city's] inhabitants a hissing and you shall bear the reproach and scorn of My people.
Micah,7,1,WOE IS me! For I am as when the summer fruits have been gathered as when the vintage grapes have been gleaned and there is no cluster to eat no first-ripe fig for which my appetite craves.
Micah,7,2,The godly man has perished from the earth and there is none upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; each hunts his brother with a net.
Micah,7,3,Both their hands are put forth and are upon what is evil to do it diligently; the prince and the judge ask for a bribe and the great man utters his evil desire. Thus they twist between them [the course of justice].
Micah,7,4,The best of them is like a brier; the most upright or the straightest is like a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen even of [God's] judgment and your punishment has come; now shall be their perplexity and confusion.
Micah,7,5,Trust not in a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.
Micah,7,6,For the son dishonors the father the daughter rises up against her mother the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--a man's enemies are the men (members) of his own house.
Micah,7,7,But as for me I will look to the Lord and confident in Him I will keep watch; I will wait with hope and expectancy for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.
Micah,7,8,Rejoice not against me O my enemy! When I fall I shall arise; when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light to me.
Micah,7,9,I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against Him until He pleads my cause and executes judgment for me. He will bring me forth to the light and I shall behold His righteous deliverance.
Micah,7,10,Then my enemy will see it and shame will cover her who said to me Where is the Lord your God? My eyes will see my desire upon her; now she will be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
Micah,7,11,In the day that your walls are to be built [a day for building] in that day shall the boundary [of Israel] be far extended and the decree [against her] be far removed.
Micah,7,12,In that day they will come to you from Assyria and from the cities of Matzor [Egypt] and from Egypt even to the river [Euphrates] from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
Micah,7,13,Yet shall the earth be desolate because of those who dwell in it for the fruit of their doings.
Micah,7,14,Rule and feed Your people with Your rod and scepter the flock of Your inheritance who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of Carmel [a garden land]; they shall feed in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.
Micah,7,15,As in the days of your coming forth from the land of Egypt I will show them marvelous things.
Micah,7,16,The nations shall see [God's deliverance] and be ashamed of all their might [which cannot be compared to His]. They shall lay their hands upon their mouths in consternation; their ears shall be deaf.
Micah,7,17,They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their strongholds and close places. They shall turn and come with fear and dread to the Lord our God and shall be afraid and stand in awe because of You [O Lord].
Micah,7,18,Who is a God like You Who forgives iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retains not His anger forever because He delights in mercy and loving-kindness.
Micah,7,19,He will again have compassion on us; He will subdue and tread underfoot our iniquities. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,You will show Your faithfulness and perform the sure promise to Jacob and loving-kindness and mercy to Abraham as You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
Nahum,1,1,THE BURDEN or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) concerning Nineveh [the capital of Assyria]. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
Nahum,1,2,The Lord is a jealous God and avenging; the Lord avenges and He is full of wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries and reserves wrath for His enemies.
Nahum,1,3,The Lord is slow to anger and great in power and will by no means clear the guilty. The Lord has His way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of His feet.
Nahum,1,4,He rebukes and threatens the sea and makes it dry and dries up all the rivers. Bashan [on the east] and Mount Carmel [on the west] wither and [in the north] the blossom of Lebanon fades.
Nahum,1,5,The mountains tremble and quake before Him and the hills melt away and the earth is upheaved at His presence--yes the world and all that dwell in it.
Nahum,1,6,Who can stand before His indignation? And who can stand up and endure the fierceness of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire and the rocks are broken asunder by Him.
Nahum,1,7,The Lord is good a Strength and Stronghold in the day of trouble; He knows (recognizes has knowledge of and understands) those who take refuge and trust in Him.
Nahum,1,8,But with an overrunning flood He will make a full end of [Nineveh's very] site and pursue His enemies into darkness.
Nahum,1,9,What do you devise and [how mad is your attempt to] plot against the Lord? He will make a full end [of Nineveh]; affliction [which My people shall suffer from Assyria] shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,For [the Ninevites] are as bundles of thorn branches [for fuel] and even while drowned in their drunken [carousing] they shall be consumed like stubble fully dry [in the day of the Lord's wrath].
Nahum,1,11,There is one gone forth out of you [O Nineveh] who plots evil against the Lord a villainous counselor [the king of Assyria who counsels for wickedness and worthlessness].
Nahum,1,12,Thus says the Lord: Though they be in full strength and likewise many even so shall [the Assyrians] be cut down when [their evil counselor] shall pass away. Though I have afflicted you [Jerusalem] I will not cause you to be afflicted [for your past sins] any more.
Nahum,1,13,For now will I break his yoke from off you and will burst your bonds asunder.
Nahum,1,14,And the Lord has given a commandment concerning you [evil Assyrian counselor] that no more of your name shall be born nor shall your name be perpetuated. Out of the house of your gods I will cut off the graven and molten images; I will make [their temple] your tomb for you are vile and despised.
Nahum,1,15,Behold! upon the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings [telling of the Assyrian's death] who publishes peace! Celebrate your feasts O Judah; perform your vows. For the wicked counselor [the king of Assyria] shall no more come against you or pass through your land; he is utterly cut off. [Then the prophet Nahum sarcastically addresses his message to Nineveh:]
Nahum,2,1,HE WHO dashes in pieces [that is the king of Medo-Babylon] is come up before your face [Nineveh]. Keep the fortress and ramparts manned watch the road gird your loins collect and fortify all your strength and power mightily.
Nahum,2,2,For the Lord restores the excellency of Jacob as the excellency of [ancient] Israel for plunderers have plundered them and emptied them out and [outrageously] destroyed their vine branches.
Nahum,2,3,The shields of the mighty men [of Media and Babylon] are [dyed] red; the valiant men are [clothed] in dyed scarlet. The chariots blaze with fire of steel on the day of his preparation [for battle] and the officers' horses prance like a cypress forest [reeling in the wind].
Nahum,2,4,The chariots rage in confusion in the streets; they run to and fro [in wild terror] in the broad ways. They flash with steel [making them appear like torches]; they rush [in various directions] like forked lightnings.
Nahum,2,5,[The Assyrian leader] remembers and summons his bravest men; they stumble in their march. They hasten to the city's wall and their movable defense shelter is prepared and set up.
Nahum,2,6,The gates or dams of the rivers [surrounding and guarding Nineveh] are opened and the [imperial] palace [of sun-dried brick] is dissolved [by the torrents] and is in dismay.
Nahum,2,7,It is decreed. She [Nineveh] is stripped and removed and her maids are lamenting and moaning like doves [softly for fear] beating upon their breasts [and hearts].
Nahum,2,8,And Nineveh like a standing pool are her waters and [her inhabitants] are fleeing away! Stand! Stand [firm! a few cry] but no one looks back or causes them to return.
Nahum,2,9,Take the spoil of silver; take the spoil of gold! For there is no end of the treasure the glory and wealth of all the precious furnishings.
Nahum,2,10,Emptiness! Desolation! Utter waste! Hearts faint and knees smite together and anguish is in all loins and the faces of all grow pale!
Nahum,2,11,Where is the den of the lions which was the feeding place of the young lions where the lion and the lioness walked and the lion's whelp and none made them afraid?
Nahum,2,12,The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled [prey] for his lionesses; he filled his caves with prey and his dens with what he had seized and carried off.
Nahum,2,13,Behold I am against you [Nineveh] says the Lord of hosts and I will burn your chariots in the smoke and the sword shall devour your young lions. And I will cut off your prey from the earth and the voice of your messengers shall no more be heard.
Nahum,3,1,WOE TO the bloody city! It is full of lies and booty and [there is] no end to the plunder!
Nahum,3,2,The cracking of the whip the noise of the rattling of wheels and prancing horses and chariots rumbling and bounding
Nahum,3,3,Horsemen mounting and charging the flashing sword the gleaming spear a multitude of slain and a great number of corpses no end of corpses! [The horsemen] stumble over the corpses!
Nahum,3,4,All because of the multitude of the harlotries [of Nineveh] the well-favored harlot the mistress of deadly charms who betrays and sells nations through her whoredoms [idolatry] and peoples through her enchantments.
Nahum,3,5,Behold I am against you says the Lord of hosts and I will lift up your skirts over your face and I will let the nations look on your nakedness [O Nineveh] and the kingdoms on your shame.
Nahum,3,6,I will cast abominable things at you and make you filthy treat you with contempt and make you a gazingstock.
Nahum,3,7,And all who look on you will shrink and flee from you and say Nineveh is laid waste; who will pity and bemoan her? Where [then] shall I seek comforters for you?
Nahum,3,8,Are you better than No-amon [Thebes capital of Upper Egypt] that dwelt by the rivers or canals that had the waters round about her whose rampart was a sea [the Nile] and water her wall?
Nahum,3,9,Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength and that without limit. Put and the Libyans were her helpers.
Nahum,3,10,Yet she was carried away; she went into captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at all the street corners; lots were cast [by the Assyrian officers] for her nobles and all her great men were bound with chains.
Nahum,3,11,You will be drunk [Nineveh with the cup of God's wrath]; you will be dazed. You will seek and require a refuge because of the enemy.
Nahum,3,12,All your fortresses are fig trees with early figs; if they are shaken they will fall into the mouth of the eater.
Nahum,3,13,Behold your troops in the midst of you are [as weak and helpless as] women; the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies [without effort]; fire consumes your bars.
Nahum,3,14,Draw for yourself the water [necessary] for a [long continued] siege make strong your fortresses! Go down into the clay pits and trample the mortar; make ready the brickkiln [to burn bricks for the bulwarks]!
Nahum,3,15,[But] there [in the very midst of these preparations] will the fire devour you; the sword will cut you off; it will destroy you as the locusts [destroy]. Multiply yourselves like the licking locusts; make yourselves many like the swarming locusts!
Nahum,3,16,You increased your merchants more than the [visible] stars of the heavens. The swarming locust spreads itself and destroys and then flies away.
Nahum,3,17,Your princes are like the grasshoppers and your marshals like the swarms of locusts which encamp in the hedges on a cold day--but when the sun rises they fly away and no one knows where they are.
Nahum,3,18,Your shepherds are asleep O king of Assyria; your nobles are lying still [in death]. Your people are scattered on the mountains and there is no one to gather them.
Nahum,3,19,There is no healing of your hurt; your wound is grievous. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over [what has happened to] you. For upon whom has not your [unceasing] evil come continually?
Habakkuk,1,1,THE BURDEN or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk,1,2,O Lord how long shall I cry for help and You will not hear? Or cry out to You of violence and You will not save?
Habakkuk,1,3,Why do You show me iniquity and wrong and Yourself look upon or cause me to see perverseness and trouble? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife and contention arises.
Habakkuk,1,4,Therefore the law is slackened and justice and a righteous sentence never go forth for the [hostility of the] wicked surrounds the [uncompromisingly] righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.
Habakkuk,1,5,Look around [you Habakkuk replied the Lord] among the nations and see! And be astonished! Astounded! For I am putting into effect a work in your days [such] that you would not believe it if it were told you.
Habakkuk,1,6,For behold I am rousing up the Chaldeans that bitter and impetuous nation who march through the breadth of the earth to take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them.
Habakkuk,1,7,[The Chaldeans] are terrible and dreadful; their justice and dignity proceed [only] from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,Their horses also are swifter than leopards and are fiercer than the evening wolves and their horsemen spread themselves and press on proudly; yes their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle that hastens to devour.
Habakkuk,1,9,They all come for violence; their faces turn eagerly forward and they gather prisoners together like sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,They scoff at kings and rulers are a derision to them; they ridicule every stronghold for they heap up dust [for earth mounds] and take it.
Habakkuk,1,11,Then they sweep by like a wind and pass on and they load themselves with guilt [as do all men] whose own power is their god.
Habakkuk,1,12,Are not You from everlasting O Lord my God my Holy One? We shall not die. O Lord You have appointed [the Chaldean] to execute [Your] judgment and You O Rock have established him for chastisement and correction.
Habakkuk,1,13,You are of purer eyes than to behold evil and can not look [inactively] upon injustice. Why then do You look upon the plunderer? Why are you silent when the wicked one destroys him who is more righteous than [the Chaldean oppressor] is?
Habakkuk,1,14,Why do You make men like the fish of the sea like reptiles and creeping things that have no ruler [and are defenseless against their foes]?
Habakkuk,1,15,[The Chaldean] brings all of them up with his hook; he catches and drags them out with his net he gathers them in his dragnet; so he rejoices and is in high spirits.
Habakkuk,1,16,Therefore he sacrifices [offerings] to his net and burns incense to his dragnet because from them he lives luxuriously and his food is plentiful and rich.
Habakkuk,1,17,Shall he therefore continue to empty his net and mercilessly go on slaying the nations forever?
Habakkuk,2,1,[OH I know I have been rash to talk out plainly this way to God!] I will [in my thinking] stand upon my post of observation and station myself on the tower or fortress and will watch to see what He will say within me and what answer I will make [as His mouthpiece] to the perplexities of my complaint against Him.
Habakkuk,2,2,And the Lord answered me and said Write the vision and engrave it so plainly upon tablets that everyone who passes may [be able to] read [it easily and quickly] as he hastens by.
Habakkuk,2,3,For the vision is yet for an appointed time and it hastens to the end [fulfillment]; it will not deceive or disappoint. Though it tarry wait [earnestly] for it because it will surely come; it will not be behindhand on its appointed day.
Habakkuk,2,4,Look at the proud; his soul is not straight or right within him but the [rigidly] just and the [uncompromisingly] righteous man shall live by his faith and in his faithfulness.
Habakkuk,2,5,Moreover wine and wealth are treacherous; the proud man [the Chaldean invader] is restless and cannot stay at home. His appetite is large like that of Sheol and [his greed] is like death and cannot be satisfied; he gathers to himself all nations and collects all people as if he owned them.
Habakkuk,2,6,Shall not all these [victims of his greed] take up a taunt against him and in scoffing derision of him say Woe to him who piles up that which is not his! [How long will he possess it?] And [woe to him] who loads himself with promissory notes for usury!
Habakkuk,2,7,Shall [your debtors] not rise up suddenly who shall bite you exacting usury of you and those awake who will vex you [toss you to and fro and make you tremble violently]? Then you will be booty for them.
Habakkuk,2,8,Because you [king of Babylon] have plundered many nations all who are left of the people shall plunder you--because of men's blood and for the violence done to the earth to the city and all the people who live in each city.
Habakkuk,2,9,Woe to him who obtains wicked gain for his house [who thinks by so doing] to set his nest on high that he may be preserved from calamity and delivered from the power of evil!
Habakkuk,2,10,You have devised shame to your house by cutting off and putting an end to many peoples and you have sinned against and forfeited your own life.
Habakkuk,2,11,For the stone shall cry out of the wall [built in sin to accuse you] and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it [agreeing with its charge against you].
Habakkuk,2,12,Woe to him who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity!
Habakkuk,2,13,Behold is it not by appointment of the Lord of hosts that the nations toil only to satisfy the fire [that will consume their work] and the peoples weary themselves only for emptiness falsity and futility?
Habakkuk,2,14,But [the time is coming when] the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk,2,15,Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink who pours out your bottle to them and adds to it your poisonous and blighting wrath and also makes them drunk that you may look on their stripped condition and pour out foul shame [on their glory]!
Habakkuk,2,16,You [yourself] will be filled with shame and contempt instead of glory. Drink also and be like an uncircumcised [heathen]! The cup [of wrath] in the Lord's right hand will come around to you [O destroyer] and foul shame shall be upon your own glory!
Habakkuk,2,17,For the violence done to Lebanon will cover and overwhelm you; the destruction of the animals [which the violence frightened away] will terrify you on account of men's blood and the violence done to the land to the city and all its inhabitants.
Habakkuk,2,18,What profit is the graven image when its maker has formed it? It is only a molten image and a teacher of lies. For the maker trusts in his own creations [as his gods] when he makes dumb idols.
Habakkuk,2,19,Woe to him who says to the wooden image Awake! and to the dumb stone Arise teach! [Yet it cannot for] behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all inside it!
Habakkuk,2,20,But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth hush and keep silence before Him.
Habakkuk,3,1,A PRAYER of Habakkuk the prophet set to wild enthusiastic and triumphal music.
Habakkuk,3,2,O Lord I have heard the report of You and was afraid. O Lord revive Your work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make [Yourself] known! In wrath [earnestly] remember love pity and mercy.
Habakkuk,3,3,God [approaching from Sinai] came from Teman [which represents Edom] and the Holy One from Mount Paran [in the Sinai region]. Selah [pause and calmly think of that]! His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of His praise.
Habakkuk,3,4,And His brightness was like the sunlight; rays streamed from His hand and there [in the sunlike splendor] was the hiding place of His power.
Habakkuk,3,5,Before Him went the pestilence [as in Egypt] and burning plague followed His feet [as in Sennacherib's army].
Habakkuk,3,6,He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook the nations and the eternal mountains were scattered and the perpetual hills bowed low. His ways are everlasting and His goings are of old.
Habakkuk,3,7,I [Habakkuk in vision] saw the tents of Cushan [probably Ethiopia] in affliction; the [tent] curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
Habakkuk,3,8,Were You displeased with the rivers O Lord? Or was Your anger against the rivers [You divided]? Was Your wrath against the [Red] Sea that You rode [before] upon Your horses and Your chariots of victory and deliverance?
Habakkuk,3,9,Your bow was made quite bare; sworn to the tribes [of Israel] by Your sure word were the rods of chastisement scourges and calamities. Selah [pause and calmly think of that]! With rivers You cleaved the earth [bringing forth waters in dry places].
Habakkuk,3,10,The mountains saw You; they trembled and writhed [as if in pain]. The overflowing of the water passed by [as at the deluge]; the deep uttered its voice and lifted its hands on high.
Habakkuk,3,11,The sun and moon stood back [as before Joshua] in their habitation at the light of Your arrows as they sped at the flash of Your glittering spear.
Habakkuk,3,12,You marched through the land in indignation; You trampled and threshed the nations in anger.
Habakkuk,3,13,You went forth and have come for the salvation of Your people for the deliverance and victory of Your anointed [people Israel]; You smote the head of the house of the wicked laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah [pause and calmly think of that]!
Habakkuk,3,14,You pierced with his own arrows the head of [the enemy's] hordes; they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me [the people] rejoicing as if to devour the poor [Israel] secretly.
Habakkuk,3,15,You have trodden the sea with Your horses [beside] the heap of great and surging waters.
Habakkuk,3,16,I heard and my [whole inner self] trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness enters into my bones and under me [down to my feet]; I tremble. I will wait quietly for the day of trouble and distress when there shall come up against [my] people him who is about to invade and oppress them.
Habakkuk,3,17,Though the fig tree does not blossom and there is no fruit on the vines [though] the product of the olive fails and the fields yield no food though the flock is cut off from the fold and there are no cattle in the stalls
Habakkuk,3,18,Yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will exult in the [victorious] God of my salvation!
Habakkuk,3,19,The Lord God is my Strength my personal bravery and my invincible army; He makes my feet like hinds' feet and will make me to walk [not to stand still in terror but to walk] and make [spiritual] progress upon my high places [of trouble suffering or responsibility]! For the Chief Musician; with my stringed instruments.
Zephaniah,1,1,THE WORD of the Lord which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi the son of Gedaliah the son of Amariah the son of Hezekiah in the days of Josiah king of Judah and son of Amon.
Zephaniah,1,2,By taking away I will make an end and I will utterly consume and sweep away all things from the face of the earth says the Lord.
Zephaniah,1,3,I will consume and sweep away man and beast; I will consume and sweep away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea. I will overthrow the stumbling blocks (the idols) with the wicked [worshipers] and I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth says the Lord.
Zephaniah,1,4,I will also stretch out My hand over Judah and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place and the name of the idol priests with the [false] priests
Zephaniah,1,5,And those who worship the starry host of the heavens upon their housetops and those who [pretend to] worship the Lord and swear by and to Him and yet swear by and to [the heathen god Molech or] Malcam [their idol king]
Zephaniah,1,6,And those who have drawn back from following the Lord and those who have not sought the Lord nor inquired for inquired of and required the Lord [as their first necessity].
Zephaniah,1,7,[Hush!] Be silent before the Lord God for the day [of the vengeance] of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared a sacrifice and He has set apart [for His use] those who have accepted His invitation.
Zephaniah,1,8,And on the day of the Lord's sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king's sons and all who are clothed in [lavish] foreign apparel [instead of the Jewish dress with its reminders to obey God's commandments].
Zephaniah,1,9,In the same day also will I punish all those who leap swiftly on or over the threshold [upon entering houses to steal] who fill their master's house with violence and deceit and fraud.
Zephaniah,1,10,And in that day says the Lord there shall be heard the voice of crying from the Fish Gate [in the wall of Jerusalem] and a wailing from the Second Quarter or Lower City and a great crashing and sound of destruction from the hills.
Zephaniah,1,11,Wail you inhabitants of the Mortar [those located in the hollow part of the city]! For all the merchant people like the people of Canaan will be silent [entirely destroyed]; all those who weighed out silver and were loaded with it will be cut off.
Zephaniah,1,12,And at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men who [like old wine] are thickening and settling on their lees who say in their hearts The Lord will not do good nor will He do evil.
Zephaniah,1,13,And their wealth shall become plunder and their houses a desolation. Though they build houses they shall not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards they shall not drink the wine from them.
Zephaniah,1,14,The great day of the Lord is near--near and hastening fast. Hark! the voice of the day of the Lord! The mighty man [unable to fight or to flee] will cry then bitterly.
Zephaniah,1,15,That day is a day of wrath a day of distress and anguish a day of ruin and devastation a day of darkness and gloom a day of clouds and thick darkness
Zephaniah,1,16,A day of the blast of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the high towers and battlements.
Zephaniah,1,17,And I will bring distress upon men so that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the Lord; their blood shall be poured out like dust and their flesh like dung.
Zephaniah,1,18,Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's indignation and wrath. But the whole earth shall be consumed in the fire of His jealous wrath for a full yes a sudden end will He make of all the inhabitants of the earth.
Zephaniah,2,1,COLLECT YOUR thoughts yes unbend yourselves [in submission and see if there is no sense of shame and no consciousness of sin left in you] O shameless nation [not desirous or desired]!
Zephaniah,2,2,[The time for repentance is speeding by like chaff whirled before the wind!] Therefore consider before God's decree brings forth [the curse upon you] before the time [to repent] is gone like the drifting chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord comes upon you--yes before the day of the wrath of the Lord comes upon you!
Zephaniah,2,3,Seek the Lord [inquire for Him inquire of Him and require Him as the foremost necessity of your life] all you humble of the land who have acted in compliance with His revealed will and have kept His commandments; seek righteousness seek humility [inquire for them require them as vital]. It may be you will be hidden in the day of the Lord's anger.
Zephaniah,2,4,For [hear the fate of the Philistines:] Gaza shall be forsaken and Ashkelon shall become a desolation; the people of Ashdod shall be driven out at noonday and Ekron shall be uprooted.
Zephaniah,2,5,Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast the nation of the Cherethites [in Philistia]! The word of the Lord is against you O Canaan land of the Philistines; I will destroy you until no inhabitant is left.
Zephaniah,2,6,And the seacoast shall be pastures with [deserted] dwelling places and caves for shepherds and folds for flocks.
Zephaniah,2,7,The seacoast shall belong to the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall pasture their flocks upon it; in the houses of [deserted Philistine] Ashkelon shall they of Judah lie down in the evening. For the Lord their [Judah's] God shall visit them [for their relief] and restore them from their captivity.
Zephaniah,2,8,I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites by which they have reproached My people and magnified themselves and made boasts against their territory.
Zephaniah,2,9,Therefore as I live says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Moab shall become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah a land possessed by nettles and wild vetches and salt pits and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people shall make a prey of them and what is left of My nation shall possess them.
Zephaniah,2,10,This shall they have for their pride because they have taunted and boasted against the people of the Lord of hosts.
Zephaniah,2,11,The Lord will be terrible to them for He will make lean and famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship Him every one from his place even all the isles and coastlands of the nations.
Zephaniah,2,12,You Ethiopians also you shall be slain by My sword.
Zephaniah,2,13,And [the Lord] will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria and will make Nineveh a desolation dry as the desert.
Zephaniah,2,14,Herds shall lie down in the midst of [Nineveh] all the [wild] beasts of the nations and of every kind; both the pelican and the hedgehog shall lodge on the upper part of her [fallen] pillars; the voice [of the nesting bird] shall sing in the windows; desolation and drought shall be on the thresholds for her cedar paneling will He lay bare.
Zephaniah,2,15,This is the joyous and exultant city that dwelt carelessly [feeling so secure] that said in her heart I am and there is none beside me. What a desolation she has become a lair for [wild] beasts! Everyone who passes by her shall hiss and wave his hand [indicating his gratification].
Zephaniah,3,1,WOE TO her that is rebellious and polluted the oppressing city [Jerusalem]!
Zephaniah,3,2,She did not listen to and heed the voice [of God]; she accepted no correction or instruction; she trusted not in the Lord [nor leaned on or was confident in Him but was confident in her own wealth]; she drew not near to her God [but to the god of Baal or Molech].
Zephaniah,3,3,Her officials in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones on the morrow for nothing is left by morning.
Zephaniah,3,4,Her prophets are light [lacking truth gravity and steadiness] and men of treachery; her priests have profaned the sanctuary; [defrauding God and man by pretending their own word is God's word] they have done violence to the law.
Zephaniah,3,5,The Lord in the midst of her is [uncompromisingly] righteous; He will not do iniquity. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He fails not but the unjust [person] knows no shame.
Zephaniah,3,6,I [the Lord] have cut off nations; their battlements and corner towers are desolate and in ruins. I laid their streets waste so that none passes over them; their cities are destroyed so that there is no man there is no inhabitant.
Zephaniah,3,7,I said Only let her [reverently and worshipfully] fear Me receive correction and instruction and [Jerusalem's] dwelling shall not be cut off. However I have punished her [according to all that I have appointed concerning her in the way of punishment] but all the more they are eager to make all their doings corrupt and infamous.
Zephaniah,3,8,Therefore [earnestly] wait for Me says the Lord [waiting] for the day when I rise up to the attack [as a witness accuser or judge and a testimony]. For My decision and determination and right it is to gather the nations together to assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them My indignation even all [the heat of] My fierce anger; for [in that day] all the earth shall be consumed with the fire of My zeal and jealousy.
Zephaniah,3,9,For then [changing their impure language] I will give to the people a clear and pure speech from pure lips that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one unanimous consent and one united shoulder [bearing the yoke of the Lord].
Zephaniah,3,10,From beyond the rivers of Cush or Ethiopia those who pray to Me the daughter of My dispersed people will bring and present My offering.
Zephaniah,3,11,In that day you [the congregation of Israel] shall not be put to shame for all your deeds by which you have rebelled and transgressed against Me for then I will take away out of your midst those who exult in your majesty and pride; and you shall no more be haughty [and carry yourselves arrogantly on or] because of My holy mountain.
Zephaniah,3,12,For I will leave in the midst of you a people afflicted and poor and they shall trust seek refuge and be confident in the name of the Lord.
Zephaniah,3,13,What is left of Israel shall not do iniquity or speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid.
Zephaniah,3,14,Sing O Daughter of Zion; shout O Israel! Rejoice be in high spirits and glory with all your heart O Daughter of Jerusalem [in that day].
Zephaniah,3,15,[For then it will be that] the Lord has taken away the judgments against you; He has cast out your enemy. The King of Israel even the Lord [Himself] is in the midst of you; [and after He has come to you] you shall not experience or fear evil any more.
Zephaniah,3,16,In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem Fear not O Zion. Let not your hands sink down or be slow and listless.
Zephaniah,3,17,The Lord your God is in the midst of you a Mighty One a Savior [Who saves]! He will rejoice over you with joy; He will rest [in silent satisfaction] and in His love He will be silent and make no mention [of past sins or even recall them]; He will exult over you with singing.
Zephaniah,3,18,I will gather those belonging to you [those Israelites in captivity] who yearn and grieve for the solemn assembly [and the festivals] on whom [their exile and inability to attend services at Jerusalem have brought derision and] the reproach of it is a burden.
Zephaniah,3,19,Behold at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you; I will save the limping [ones] and gather the outcasts and will make them a praise and a name in every land of their shame.
Zephaniah,3,20,At that time I will bring you in; yes at that time I will gather you for I will make you a name and a praise among all the nations of the earth when I reverse your captivity before your eyes says the Lord.
Haggai,1,1,IN THE second year of Darius king [of Persia] in the sixth month on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came by means of Haggai the prophet [in Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity] to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest saying
Haggai,1,2,Thus says the Lord of hosts: These people say The time is not yet come that the Lord's house should be rebuilt [although Cyrus had ordered it done eighteen years before].
Haggai,1,3,Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet saying
Haggai,1,4,Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house [of the Lord] lies in ruins?
Haggai,1,5,Now therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways and set your mind on what has come to you.
Haggai,1,6,You have sown much but you have reaped little; you eat but you do not have enough; you drink but you do not have your fill; you clothe yourselves but no one is warm; and he who earns wages has earned them to put them in a bag with holes in it.
Haggai,1,7,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways (your previous and present conduct) and how you have fared.
Haggai,1,8,Go up to the hill country and bring lumber and rebuild [My] house and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified says the Lord [by accepting it as done for My glory and by displaying My glory in it].
Haggai,1,9,You looked for much [harvest] and behold it came to little; and even when you brought that home I blew it away. Why? says the Lord of hosts. Because of My house which lies waste while you yourselves run each man to his own house [eager to build and adorn it].
Haggai,1,10,Therefore the heavens above you [for your sake] withhold the dew and the earth withholds its produce.
Haggai,1,11,And I have called for a drought upon the land and the hill country upon the grain the fresh wine the oil upon what the ground brings forth upon men and cattle and upon all the [wearisome] toil of [men's] hands.
Haggai,1,12,Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest with all the remnant of the people [who had returned from captivity] listened to and obeyed the voice of the Lord their God [not vaguely or partly but completely according to] the words of Haggai the prophet since the Lord their God had sent him and the people [reverently] feared and [worshipfully] turned to the Lord.
Haggai,1,13,Then Haggai the Lord's messenger spoke the Lord's message to the people saying I am with you says the Lord.
Haggai,1,14,And the Lord aroused the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people so that they came and labored on the house of the Lord of hosts their God
Haggai,1,15,On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.
Haggai,2,1,IN THE seventh month on the twenty-first day of the month in the second year of Darius king [of Persia] came the word of the Lord by the prophet Haggai saying
Haggai,2,2,Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and to the remainder of the people saying
Haggai,2,3,Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Is not this in your sight as nothing in comparison to that?
Haggai,2,4,Yet now be strong alert and courageous O Zerubbabel says the Lord; be strong alert and courageous O Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest; and be strong alert and courageous all you people of the land says the Lord and work! For I am with you says the Lord of hosts.
Haggai,2,5,According to the promise that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so My Spirit stands and abides in the midst of you; fear not.
Haggai,2,6,For thus says the Lord of hosts: Yet once more in a little while I will shake and make tremble the [starry] heavens the earth the sea and the dry land;
Haggai,2,7,And I will shake all nations and the desire and the precious things of all nations shall come in and I will fill this house with splendor says the Lord of hosts.
Haggai,2,8,The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine says the Lord of hosts.
Haggai,2,9,The latter glory of this house [with its successor to which Jesus came] shall be greater than the former says the Lord of hosts; and in this place will I give peace and prosperity says the Lord of hosts.
Haggai,2,10,On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet saying
Haggai,2,11,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Ask now the priests to decide this question of law:
Haggai,2,12,If one carries in the skirt of his garment flesh that is holy [because it has been offered in sacrifice to God] and with his skirt or the flaps of his garment he touches bread or pottage or wine or oil or any kind of food does what he touches become holy [dedicated to God's service exclusively]? And the priests answered No! [Holiness is not infectious.]
Haggai,2,13,Then said Haggai If one who is [ceremonially] unclean because he has come in contact with a dead body should touch any of these articles of food shall it be [ceremonially] unclean? And the priests answered It shall be unclean. [Unholiness is infectious.]
Haggai,2,14,Then answered Haggai So is this people and so is this nation before Me says the Lord; and so is every work of their hands and what they offer there [on the altar] is unclean [because they who offer it are themselves unclean].
Haggai,2,15,And now I pray you consider what will happen from this day onward. Since the time before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord how have you fared?
Haggai,2,16,Through all that time [the harvests have not fulfilled expectations for] when one has gone expecting to find a heap [of sheaves] of twenty measures there were but ten; when he has gone to the wine vat to draw out fifty bucketfuls from the press there were only twenty.
Haggai,2,17,I smote you with blight and with mildew and with hail in all [the products of] the labors of your hands; yet you returned not nor were converted to Me says the Lord.
Haggai,2,18,Consider I pray you from this day onward from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month even from the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was [re]laid consider this:
Haggai,2,19,Is the harvested grain any longer in the barn? As to the grapevine the fig tree the pomegranate and the olive tree--they have not yet borne. From this day on I will bless you.
Haggai,2,20,And again the word of the Lord came to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month saying
Haggai,2,21,Speak to Zerubbabel [the representative of the Davidic monarchy and covenant and in direct line of the ancestry of Jesus Christ] governor of Judah saying I will shake the heavens and the earth;
Haggai,2,22,And I will [in the distant future] overthrow the throne of kingdoms and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the [ungodly] nations and I will overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them and the horses and their riders shall go down every one by the sword of his brother.
Haggai,2,23,In that day says the Lord of hosts will I take you O Zerubbabel My servant the son of Shealtiel says the Lord and will make you [through the Messiah your descendant] My signet ring; for I have chosen you [as the one with whom to renew My covenant to David's line] says the Lord of hosts.
Zechariah,1,1,IN THE eighth month in the second year [of the reign] of Darius came the word of the Lord to Zechariah son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet saying
Zechariah,1,2,The Lord was very angry with your fathers.
Zechariah,1,3,Therefore say to them [the Jews of this day] Thus says the Lord of hosts: Return to Me says the Lord of hosts and I will return to you; it is the utterance of the Lord of hosts.
Zechariah,1,4,Be not as your fathers to whom the former prophets cried Thus says the Lord of hosts: Return now from your evil ways and your evil doings; but they would not hear or listen to Me says the Lord.
Zechariah,1,5,Your fathers where are they? And the prophets do they live forever?
Zechariah,1,6,But My words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets did they not overtake and take hold of your fathers? So they repented and said As the Lord of hosts planned and purposed to do to us according to our ways and according to our doings so has He dealt with us.
Zechariah,1,7,Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month which is the month of Shebat in the second year of the reign of Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet. Zechariah said
Zechariah,1,8,I saw in the night [vision] and behold a Man riding upon a red horse and He stood among the myrtle trees that were in a low valley or bottom and behind Him there were horses red bay or flame-colored and white.
Zechariah,1,9,Then said I O my lord what are these? And the angel who talked with me said I will show you what these are.
Zechariah,1,10,And the Man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said These are they whom the Lord has sent to walk to and fro through the earth and patrol it.
Zechariah,1,11,And the men on the horses answered the Angel of the Lord Who stood among the myrtle trees and said We have walked to and fro through the earth [patrolling it] and behold all the earth sits at rest [in peaceful security].
Zechariah,1,12,Then the Angel of the Lord said O Lord of hosts how long will You not have mercy and lovingkindness for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah against which You have had indignation these seventy years [of the Babylonian captivity]?
Zechariah,1,13,And the Lord answered the angel who talked with me with gracious and comforting words.
Zechariah,1,14,So the angel who talked with me said to me Cry out Thus says the Lord of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
Zechariah,1,15,And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was but a little displeased they helped forward the affliction and disaster.
Zechariah,1,16,Therefore thus says the Lord: I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion (lovingkindness and mercy). My house shall be built in it says the Lord of hosts and a measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem [with a view to rebuilding its walls].
Zechariah,1,17,Cry yet again saying Thus says the Lord of hosts: My cities shall yet again overflow with prosperity and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah,1,18,Then I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four horns [symbols of strength].
Zechariah,1,19,And I said to the angel who talked with me What are these? And he answered me These are the horns or powers which have scattered Judah Israel and Jerusalem.
Zechariah,1,20,Then the Lord showed me four smiths or workmen [one for each enemy horn to beat it down].
Zechariah,1,21,Then said I What are these [horns and smiths] coming to do? And he said These are the horns or powers that scattered Judah so that no man lifted up his head. But these smiths or workmen have come to terrorize them and cause them to be panic-stricken to cast out the horns or powers of the nations who lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.
Zechariah,2,1,AND I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah,2,2,Then said I Where are you going? And he said to me To measure Jerusalem to see what is its breadth and what is its length.
Zechariah,2,3,And behold the angel who talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet him
Zechariah,2,4,And he said to the second angel Run speak to this young man saying Jerusalem shall be inhabited and dwell as villages without walls because of the multitude of people and livestock in it.
Zechariah,2,5,For I says the Lord will be to her a wall of fire round about and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
Zechariah,2,6,Ho! ho! [Hear and] flee from the land of the north says the Lord and from the four winds of the heavens for to them have I scattered you says the Lord.
Zechariah,2,7,Ho! Escape to Zion you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon!
Zechariah,2,8,For thus said the Lord of hosts after [His] glory had sent me [His messenger] to the nations who plundered you--for he who touches you touches the apple or pupil of His eye:
Zechariah,2,9,Behold I will swing my hand over them and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord of hosts has sent me [His messenger].
Zechariah,2,10,Sing and rejoice O Daughter of Zion; for behold I come and I will dwell in the midst of you says the Lord.
Zechariah,2,11,And many nations shall join themselves to the Lord in that day and shall be My people. And I will dwell in the midst of you and you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord of hosts has sent me [His messenger] to you.
Zechariah,2,12,And the Lord shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land and shall again choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah,2,13,Be still all flesh before the Lord for He is aroused and risen from His holy habitation.
Zechariah,3,1,THEN [the guiding angel] showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord and Satan standing at Joshua's right hand to be his adversary and to accuse him.
Zechariah,3,2,And the Lord said to Satan The Lord rebuke you O Satan! Even the Lord Who [now and habitually] chooses Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this [returned captive Joshua] a brand plucked out of the fire?
Zechariah,3,3,Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the Angel [of the Lord].
Zechariah,3,4,And He spoke to those who stood before Him saying Take away the filthy garments from him. And He said to [Joshua] Behold I have caused your iniquity to pass from you and I will clothe you with rich apparel.
Zechariah,3,5,And I [Zechariah] said Let them put a clean turban on his head. So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with [rich] garments. And the Angel of the Lord stood by.
Zechariah,3,6,And the Angel of the Lord [solemnly and earnestly] protested and affirmed to Joshua saying
Zechariah,3,7,Thus says the Lord of hosts: If you will walk in My ways and keep My charge then also you shall rule My house and have charge of My courts and I will give you access [to My presence] and places to walk among these who stand here.
Zechariah,3,8,Hear now O Joshua the high priest you and your colleagues who [usually] sit before you--for they are men who are a sign or omen [types of what is to come]--for behold I will bring forth My servant the Branch.
Zechariah,3,9,For behold upon the stone which I have set before Joshua upon that one stone are seven eyes or facets [the all-embracing providence of God and the sevenfold radiations of the Spirit of God]. Behold I will carve upon it its inscription says the Lord of hosts and I will remove the iniquity and guilt of this land in a single day.
Zechariah,3,10,In that day says the Lord of hosts you shall invite each man his neighbor under his own vine and his own fig tree.
Zechariah,4,1,AND THE angel who talked with me came again and awakened me like a man who is wakened out of his sleep.
Zechariah,4,2,And said to me What do you see? I said I see and behold a lampstand all of gold with its bowl [for oil] on the top of it and its seven lamps on it and [there are] seven pipes to each of the seven lamps which are upon the top of it.
Zechariah,4,3,And there are two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side of it [feeding it continuously with oil].
Zechariah,4,4,So I asked the angel who talked with me What are these my lord?
Zechariah,4,5,Then the angel who talked with me answered me Do you not know what these are? And I said No my lord.
Zechariah,4,6,Then he said to me This [addition of the bowl to the candlestick causing it to yield a ceaseless supply of oil from the olive trees] is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel saying Not by might nor by power but by My Spirit [of Whom the oil is a symbol] says the Lord of hosts.
Zechariah,4,7,For who are you O great mountain [of human obstacles]? Before Zerubbabel [who with Joshua had led the return of the exiles from Babylon and was undertaking the rebuilding of the temple before him] you shall become a plain [a mere molehill]! And he shall bring forth the finishing gable stone [of the new temple] with loud shoutings of the people crying Grace grace to it!
Zechariah,4,8,Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying
Zechariah,4,9,The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this house; his hands shall also finish it. Then you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord of hosts has sent me [His messenger] to you.
Zechariah,4,10,Who [with reason] despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. [These seven] are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth.
Zechariah,4,11,Then I said to him [the angel who talked with me] What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?
Zechariah,4,12,And a second time I said to him What are these two olive branches which are beside the two golden tubes or spouts by which the golden oil is emptied out?
Zechariah,4,13,And he answered me Do you not know what these are? And I said No my lord.
Zechariah,4,14,Then said he These are the two sons of oil [Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the prince of Judah the two anointed ones] who stand before the Lord of the whole earth [as His anointed instruments].
Zechariah,5,1,AGAIN I lifted up my eyes and behold I saw a scroll flying or floating in the air!
Zechariah,5,2,And the angel said to me What do you see? And I answered I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits or thirty feet and its breadth is ten cubits or fifteen feet.
Zechariah,5,3,Then he said to me This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off from henceforth according to it [the curse written on this subject on the scroll] and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off from henceforth according to it.
Zechariah,5,4,I will bring [the curse] forth says the Lord of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him who swears falsely by My name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house and shall consume it both its timber and its stones.
Zechariah,5,5,Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.
Zechariah,5,6,And I said What is it? [What does it symbolize?] And he said This that goes forth is an ephah[-sized vessel for separate grains all collected together]. This he continued is the symbol of the sinners mentioned above and is the resemblance of their iniquity throughout the whole land.
Zechariah,5,7,And behold a round flat weight of lead was lifted and there sat a woman in the midst of the ephah[-sized vessel].
Zechariah,5,8,And he said This is lawlessness (wickedness)! And he thrust her back into the ephah[-sized vessel] and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth of it!
Zechariah,5,9,Then lifted I up my eyes and looked and behold there were two women coming forward! The wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah[-sized vessel] between the earth and the heavens.
Zechariah,5,10,Then said I to the angel who talked with me Where are they taking the ephah[-sized vessel]?
Zechariah,5,11,And he said to me To the land of Shinar [Babylonia] to build it a house and when it is finished to set up the ephah[-sized vessel--the symbol of such sinners and their guilt] there upon its own base.
Zechariah,6,1,AND AGAIN I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of firm immovable bronze.
Zechariah,6,2,The first chariot had red or bay horses the second chariot had black horses
Zechariah,6,3,The third chariot had white horses and the fourth chariot had dappled active and strong horses.
Zechariah,6,4,Then I said to the angel who talked with me What are these my lord?
Zechariah,6,5,And the angel answered me These are the four winds or spirits of the heavens which go forth from presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.
Zechariah,6,6,The chariot with the black horses is going forth into the north country and the white ones are going forth after them [because there are two northern powers to overcome] and the dappled ones are going forth toward the south country.
Zechariah,6,7,And [the chariots with] the strong [horses] went forth and sought to go that they might patrol the earth. And [the Lord] said to them Go walk to and fro through the earth and patrol it. So they walked about through the earth [watching and protecting it].
Zechariah,6,8,Then He summoned me and said to me Behold these that go toward the north country have quieted My Spirit [of wrath] and have caused it to rest in the north country.
Zechariah,6,9,And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Zechariah,6,10,Accept donations and offerings from these [as representatives of the] exiles from Heldai from Tobijah and from Jedaiah who have come from Babylon; and come the same day and go to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.
Zechariah,6,11,Yes take from them silver and gold and make crowns and set [one] upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest
Zechariah,6,12,And say to him Thus says the Lord of hosts: [You Joshua] behold (look at keep in sight watch) the Man [the Messiah] whose name is the Branch for He shall grow up in His place and He shall build the [true] temple of the Lord.
Zechariah,6,13,Yes [you are building a temple of the Lord but] it is He Who shall build the [true] temple of the Lord and He shall bear the honor and glory [as of the only begotten of the Father] and shall sit and rule upon His throne. And He shall be a Priest upon His throne and the counsel of peace shall be between the two [offices--Priest and King].
Zechariah,6,14,And the [other] crown shall be [credited] to Helem (Heldai) to Tobijah and to Jedaiah and to the kindness and favor of Josiah the son of Zephaniah and shall be in the temple of the Lord for a reminder and memorial.
Zechariah,6,15,And those who are far off shall come and help build the temple of the Lord and you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord sent me [Zechariah] to you. And [your part in this] shall come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.
Zechariah,7,1,AND IN the fourth year of the reign of King Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month Chislev.
Zechariah,7,2,Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to pray and entreat the favor of the Lord
Zechariah,7,3,And to speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts and to the prophets saying [Now that I am returned from exile] should I weep in the fifth month separating myself as I have done these so many years [in Babylon]?
Zechariah,7,4,Then came the word of the Lord of hosts to me [Zechariah] saying
Zechariah,7,5,Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests saying When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months even those seventy years you were in exile was it for Me that you fasted for Me?
Zechariah,7,6,And when you ate and when you drank did you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?
Zechariah,7,7,Should you not hear the words which the Lord cried by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity with her cities round about her and the South (the Negeb) and the lowlands were inhabited?
Zechariah,7,8,And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah saying
Zechariah,7,9,Thus has the Lord of hosts spoken: Execute true judgment and show mercy and kindness and tender compassion every man to his brother;
Zechariah,7,10,And oppress not the widow or the fatherless the temporary resident or the poor and let none of you devise or imagine or think evil against his brother in your heart.
Zechariah,7,11,But they refused to listen and turned a rebellious and stubborn shoulder and made heavy and dull their ears that they might not hear.
Zechariah,7,12,Yes they made their hearts as an adamant stone or diamond point lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore there came great wrath from the Lord of hosts.
Zechariah,7,13,So it came to pass that as He cried and they would not hear [He said] So they shall cry and I will not answer says the Lord of hosts
Zechariah,7,14,But I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they know not and who know not them. Thus the land was desolate after they had gone so that no man passed through or returned for they [the Jews by their sins] had [caused to be] laid waste and forsaken the pleasant land (the land of desire).
Zechariah,8,1,AND THE word of the Lord of hosts came to me saying
Zechariah,8,2,Thus says the Lord of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy and I am jealous for her with great wrath [against her enemies].
Zechariah,8,3,Thus says the Lord: I shall return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and Jerusalem shall be called the [faithful] City of Truth and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the Holy Mountain.
Zechariah,8,4,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Old men and old women shall again dwell in Jerusalem and sit out in the streets every man with his staff in his hand for very [advanced] age.
Zechariah,8,5,And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
Zechariah,8,6,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Because it will be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days [in which it comes to pass] should it also be marvelous in My eyes? says the Lord of hosts.
Zechariah,8,7,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold I will save My people from the east country and from the west [the country of the going down of the sun].
Zechariah,8,8,And I will bring them [home] and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people and I will be their God in truth and faithfulness and in righteousness.
Zechariah,8,9,Thus says the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strong and hardened you who in these days hear these words from the mouths of the prophets who on the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid foretold that the temple should be rebuilt.
Zechariah,8,10,For before those days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast neither was there any peace or success to him who went out or came in because of the adversary and oppressor for I set (let loose) all men every one against his neighbor.
Zechariah,8,11,But now [in this period since you began to build] I am not to the remnant of this people as in the former days says the Lord of hosts.
Zechariah,8,12,For there shall the seed produce peace and prosperity; the vine shall yield her fruit and the ground shall give its increase and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit and possess all these things.
Zechariah,8,13,And as you have been a curse and a byword among the nations O house of Judah and house of Israel so will I save you and you shall be a blessing. Fear not but let your hands be strong and hardened.
Zechariah,8,14,For thus says the Lord of hosts: As I thought to bring calamity upon you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath says the Lord of hosts and I did not relent or revoke your sentence
Zechariah,8,15,So again have I purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear not!
Zechariah,8,16,These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor; render the truth and pronounce the judgment or verdict that makes for peace in [the courts at] your gates.
Zechariah,8,17,And let none of you think or imagine or devise evil or injury in your hearts against his neighbor and love no false oath for all these things I hate says the Lord.
Zechariah,8,18,And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me [Zechariah] saying
Zechariah,8,19,Thus says the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah times of joy and gladness and cheerful appointed seasons; therefore [in order that this may happen to you as the condition of fulfilling the promise] love truth and peace.
Zechariah,8,20,Thus says the Lord of hosts: It shall yet come to pass that there shall come [to Jerusalem] peoples and the inhabitants of many and great cities
Zechariah,8,21,And the inhabitants of one city shall go to them of another saying Let us go speedily to pray and entreat the favor of the Lord and to seek inquire of and require [to meet our own most essential need] the Lord of hosts. I will go also.
Zechariah,8,22,Yes many people and strong nations shall come to Jerusalem to seek inquire of and require [to fill their own urgent need] the Lord of hosts and to pray to the Lord for His favor.
Zechariah,8,23,Thus says the Lord of hosts: In those days ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold of the robe of him who is a Jew saying Let us go with you for we have heard that God is with you.
Zechariah,9,1,THE BURDEN or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) of the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach [in Syria] and Damascus shall be its resting place for the Lord has an eye upon mankind as upon all the tribes of Israel
Zechariah,9,2,And Hamath also which borders on [Damascus] Tyre with Sidon though they are very wise.
Zechariah,9,3,And Tyre has built herself a stronghold [on an island a half mile from the shore which seems impregnable] and heaped up silver like dust and fine gold like the mire of the streets.
Zechariah,9,4,Behold the Lord will cast her out and dispossess her; He will smite her power in the sea and into it and [Tyre] shall be devoured by fire.
Zechariah,9,5,[The strong cities of Philistia] shall see it and fear; Ashkelon Gaza also and be sorely pained and Ekron for her confidence and expectation shall be put to shame and a king [monarchial government] shall perish from Gaza and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
Zechariah,9,6,And a mongrel people shall dwell in Ashdod and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah,9,7,And I will take out of [the Philistines'] mouths and from between their teeth the abominable idolatrous sacrifices eaten with the blood. And they too shall remain and be a remnant for our God and they shall be like chieftains (the head over a thousand) in Judah and Ekron shall be like one of the Jebusites [who at last were merged and had lost their identity in Israel].
Zechariah,9,8,Then I will encamp about My house as a guard or a garrison so that none shall march back and forth and no oppressor or demanding collector shall again overrun them for now My eyes are upon them.
Zechariah,9,9,Rejoice greatly O Daughter of Zion! Shout aloud O Daughter of Jerusalem! Behold your King comes to you; He is [uncompromisingly] just and having salvation [triumphant and victorious] patient meek lowly and riding on a donkey upon a colt the foal of a donkey.
Zechariah,9,10,And I will cut off and exterminate the war chariot from Ephraim and the [war] horse from Jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off; and He shall speak the word and peace shall come to the nations and His dominion shall be from the [Mediterranean] Sea to [any other] sea and from the River [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth!
Zechariah,9,11,As for you also because of and for the sake of the [covenant of the Lord with His people which was sealed with sprinkled] covenant blood I have released and sent forth your imprisoned people out of the waterless pit.
Zechariah,9,12,Return to the stronghold [of security and prosperity] you prisoners of hope; even today do I declare that I will restore double your former prosperity to you.
Zechariah,9,13,For I have bent Judah for Myself as My bow filled the bow with Ephraim as My arrow and will stir up your sons O Zion against your sons O Greece and will make you [Israel] as the sword of a mighty man.
Zechariah,9,14,And the Lord shall be seen over them and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the Lord God will blow the trumpet and will go forth in the windstorms of the south.
Zechariah,9,15,The Lord of hosts shall defend and protect them; and they shall devour and they shall tread on [their fallen enemies] as on slingstones [that have missed their aim] and they shall drink [of victory] and be noisy and turbulent as from wine and become full like bowls [used to catch the sacrificial blood] like the corners of the [sacrificial] altar.
Zechariah,9,16,And the Lord their God will save them on that day as the flock of His people for they shall be as the [precious] jewels of a crown lifted high over and shining glitteringly upon His land.
Zechariah,9,17,For how great is God's goodness and how great is His beauty! And how great [He will make Israel's] goodliness and [Israel's] beauty! Grain shall make the young men thrive and fresh wine the maidens.
Zechariah,10,1,ASK OF the Lord rain in the time of the latter or spring rain. It is the Lord Who makes lightnings which usher in the rain and give men showers and grass to everyone in the field.
Zechariah,10,2,For the teraphim (household idols) have spoken vanity (emptiness falsity and futility) and the diviners have seen a lie and the dreamers have told false dreams; they comfort in vain. Therefore the people go their way like sheep; they are afflicted and hurt because there is no shepherd.
Zechariah,10,3,My anger is kindled against the shepherds [who are not true shepherds] and I will punish the goat leaders for the Lord of hosts has visited His flock the house of Judah and will make them as His beautiful and majestic horse in the battle.
Zechariah,10,4,Out of him [Judah] shall come forth the Cornerstone out of him the tent peg out of him the battle bow; every ruler shall proceed from him.
Zechariah,10,5,And they shall be like mighty men treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the Lord is with them and the [oppressor's] riders on horses shall be confounded and put to shame.
Zechariah,10,6,And I will strengthen the house of Judah and I will save the house of Joseph [Ephraim]. I will bring them back and cause them to dwell securely for I have mercy loving-kindness and compassion for them. They shall be as though I had not cast them off for I am the Lord their God and I will hear them.
Zechariah,10,7,Then Ephraim [the ten tribes] shall become like a mighty warrior and their hearts shall rejoice as through wine; yes their children shall see it and rejoice; their hearts shall feel great delight and glory triumphantly in the Lord!
Zechariah,10,8,I will hiss for them [as the keeper does for his bees] and gather them in for I have redeemed them and they shall increase [again] as they have increased [before in Egypt].
Zechariah,10,9,And though I sow them among the nations yet they shall [earnestly] remember Me in far countries and with their children they shall live and shall return [to God and the land He gave them].
Zechariah,10,10,I will bring them [all Israel] home again from the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria and I will bring them into the land [on the east and on the west of the Jordan into] Gilead and Lebanon and room enough shall not be found for them.
Zechariah,10,11,And [the Lord] will pass through the sea of distress and affliction [at the head of His people as He did at the Red Sea]; and He will smite down the waves of the sea and all the depths of the [river] Nile shall be dried up and put to shame; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down and the scepter or rod [of the taskmasters of Egypt] shall pass away.
Zechariah,10,12,And I will strengthen [Israel] in the Lord and they shall walk up and down and glory in His name says the Lord.
Zechariah,11,1,OPEN YOUR doors O Lebanon that the fire may devour your cedars!
Zechariah,11,2,Wail O fir tree and cypress for the cedar has fallen because the glorious and lofty trees are laid waste! Wail O you oaks of Bashan for the thick and inaccessible forest [on the steep mountainside] has in flames been felled!
Zechariah,11,3,A voice of the wailing of the shepherds for their glory the broad pasturage is laid waste! A voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of the Jordan [the jungle or thickets] is ruined!
Zechariah,11,4,Thus says the Lord my God: Shepherd the flock [destined] for slaughter
Zechariah,11,5,Whose buyers or possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty; and they who sell them say Blessed be the Lord for I have become rich! And their own shepherds neither pity nor spare them [from the wolves].
Zechariah,11,6,For I will no more pity or spare the inhabitants of the land says the Lord; but behold I will deliver every man into his neighbor's hand and into the hand of his [foreign] king. And [the enemy] shall lay waste the land and I will not deliver [the people] out of the hand [of the foreign oppressor].
Zechariah,11,7,So I [Zechariah] shepherded the flock of slaughter truly [as the name implies] the most miserable of sheep. And I took two [shepherd's] staffs the one I called Beauty or Grace and the other I called Bands or Union; and I fed and shepherded the flock.
Zechariah,11,8,And I cut off the three shepherds [the civil authorities the priests and the prophets] in one month for I was weary and impatient with them and they also loathed me.
Zechariah,11,9,So I [Zechariah] said I will not be your shepherd. What is to die let it die and what is to be destroyed let it be destroyed; and let the survivors devour one another's flesh.
Zechariah,11,10,And I took my staff Beauty or Grace and broke it in pieces to show that I was annulling the covenant or agreement which I had made with all the peoples [not to molest them].
Zechariah,11,11,So the covenant was annulled on that day and thus the most wretched of the flock and the traffickers in the sheep who were watching me knew (recognized and understood) that it was truly the word of the Lord.
Zechariah,11,12,And I said to them If it seems just and right to you give me my wages; but if not withhold them. So they weighed out for my price thirty pieces of silver.
Zechariah,11,13,And the Lord said to me Cast it to the potter [as if He said To the dogs!]--the munificently [miserable] sum at which I [and My shepherd] am priced by them! And I [Zechariah] took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.
Zechariah,11,14,Then I broke into pieces my other staff Bands or Union indicating that I was annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah,11,15,And the Lord said to me Take up once more the implements [the staff and rod of a shepherd but this time] of a worthless and wicked shepherd.
Zechariah,11,16,For behold I will raise up a false shepherd in the land; the lost and perishing he will not miss or visit the young and scattered he will not go to seek the wounded and broken he will not heal nor will he feed those that are sound and strong; but he will eat the flesh of the fat ones and break off their hoofs [to consume all the flesh].
Zechariah,11,17,Woe to the worthless and foolish shepherd who deserts the flock! The sword shall smite his arm and his right eye; his arm shall be utterly withered and his right eye utterly blinded.
Zechariah,12,1,THE BURDEN or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) of the word of the Lord concerning Israel: Thus says the Lord Who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him:
Zechariah,12,2,Behold I am about to make Jerusalem a cup or bowl of reeling to all the peoples round about and in the siege against Jerusalem will there also be a siege against and upon Judah.
Zechariah,12,3,And in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all peoples; all who lift it or burden themselves with it shall be sorely wounded. And all the nations of the earth shall come and gather together against it.
Zechariah,12,4,In that day says the Lord I will smite every horse [of the armies that contend against Jerusalem] with terror and panic and his rider with madness; and I will open My eyes and regard with favor the house of Judah and will smite every horse of the opposing nations with blindness.
Zechariah,12,5,And the chiefs of Judah shall say in their hearts The inhabitants of Jerusalem are our strength in the Lord of hosts their God.
Zechariah,12,6,In that day will I make the chiefs of Judah like a big blazing pot among [sticks of] wood and like a flaming torch among sheaves [of grain] and they shall devour all the peoples round about on the right hand and on the left; and they of Jerusalem shall yet again dwell and sit securely in their own place in Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,7,And the Lord shall save and give victory to the tents of Judah first that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified and exalted above Judah.
Zechariah,12,8,In that day will the Lord guard and defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he who is [spiritually] feeble and stumbles among them in that day [of persecution] shall become [strong and noble] like David; and the house of David [shall maintain its supremacy] like God like the Angel of the Lord Who is before them.
Zechariah,12,9,And it shall be in that day that I will make it My aim to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace or unmerited favor and supplication. And they shall look [earnestly] upon Me Whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son and shall be in bitterness for Him as one who is in bitterness for his firstborn.
Zechariah,12,11,In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of [the city of] Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddo [over beloved King Josiah].
Zechariah,12,12,And the land shall mourn every family apart: the [kingly] family of the house of David apart and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan [David's son] apart and their wives apart;
Zechariah,12,13,The [priestly] family of the house of Levi apart and their wives apart; the family of Shimei [grandson of Levi] apart and their wives apart;
Zechariah,12,14,All the families that are left each by itself and their wives by themselves [each with an overwhelming individual sorrow over having blindly rejected their unrecognized Messiah].
Zechariah,13,1,IN THAT day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem [to cleanse them from] sin and uncleanness.
Zechariah,13,2,And in that day says the Lord of hosts I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will remove from the land the [false] prophets and the unclean spirit.
Zechariah,13,3,And if anyone again appears [falsely] as a prophet then his father and his mother who bore him shall say to him You shall not live for you speak lies in the name of the Lord; and his father and his mother who bore him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.
Zechariah,13,4,And in that day the [false] prophets shall each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies nor will he wear a hairy or rough garment to deceive
Zechariah,13,5,But he will [deny his identity and] say I am no prophet. I am a tiller of the ground for I have been made a bond servant from my youth.
Zechariah,13,6,And one shall say to him What are these wounds on your breast or between your hands? Then he will answer Those with which I was wounded [when disciplined] in the house of my [loving] friends.
Zechariah,13,7,Awake O sword against My shepherd and against the man who is My associate says the Lord of hosts; smite the shepherd and the sheep [of the flock] shall be scattered and I will turn back My hand and stretch it out again upon the little ones [of the flock].
Zechariah,13,8,And in all the land says the Lord two-thirds shall be cut off and perish but one-third shall be left alive.
Zechariah,13,9,And I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name and I will hear and answer them. I will say It is My people; and they will say The Lord is my God.
Zechariah,14,1,BEHOLD A day of the Lord is coming when the spoil [taken from you] shall be divided [among the victors] in the midst of you.
Zechariah,14,2,For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go into exile but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
Zechariah,14,3,Then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those nations as when He fought in the day of battle.
Zechariah,14,4,And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which lies before Jerusalem on the east and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from the east to the west by a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south.
Zechariah,14,5,And you shall flee by the valley of My mountains for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal and you shall flee as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and the Lord my [Zechariah's] God shall come and all the holy ones [saints and angels] with Him.
Zechariah,14,6,And it shall come to pass in that day that there shall not be light; the glorious and bright ones [the heavenly bodies] shall be darkened.
Zechariah,14,7,But it shall be one continuous day known to the Lord--not day and not night but at evening time there shall be light.
Zechariah,14,8,And it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem half of them to the eastern [Dead] Sea and half of them to the western [Mediterranean] Sea; in summer and in winter shall it be.
Zechariah,14,9,And the Lord shall be King over all the earth; in that day the Lord shall be one [in the recognition and worship of men] and His name one.
Zechariah,14,10,All the land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon [the Rimmon that is] south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain lifted up on its site and dwell in its place from Benjamin's gate to the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
Zechariah,14,11,And it shall be inhabited for there shall be no more curse or ban of utter destruction but Jerusalem shall dwell securely.
Zechariah,14,12,And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall corrode away in their sockets and their tongue shall decay away in their mouth.
Zechariah,14,13,And in that day there shall be a great confusion discomfiture and panic among them from the Lord; and they shall seize each his neighbor's hand and the hand of the one shall be raised against the hand of the other.
Zechariah,14,14,And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together--gold and silver and apparel in great abundance.
Zechariah,14,15,And as that plague on men so shall be the plague on the horse on the mule on the camel on the donkey and on all the livestock and beasts that may be in those camps.
Zechariah,14,16,And everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles or Booths.
Zechariah,14,17,And it shall be that whoso of the families of the earth shall not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King the Lord of hosts upon them there shall be no rain.
Zechariah,14,18,And if the family of Egypt does not go up to Jerusalem and present themselves upon them there shall be no rain but there shall be the plague with which the Lord will smite the nations that go not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.
Zechariah,14,19,This shall be the consequent punishment of the sin of Egypt and the consequent punishment of the sin of all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.
Zechariah,14,20,In that day there shall be [written] upon the [little] bells on the horses HOLY TO THE LORD and the pots in the Lord's house shall be holy to the Lord like the bowls before the altar.
Zechariah,14,21,Yes every pot in all the houses of Jerusalem and in Judah shall be dedicated and holy to the Lord of hosts and all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil their sacrifices in them [and traders in such wares will no longer be seen at the temple]. And in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite [that is any godless or unclean person whether Jew or Gentile] in the house of the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,1,1,THE BURDEN or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi [My messenger].
Malachi,1,2,I have loved you says the Lord. Yet you say How and in what way have You loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? says the Lord; yet I loved Jacob (Israel)
Malachi,1,3,But [in comparison with the degree of love I have for Jacob] I have hated Esau [Edom] and have laid waste his mountains and his heritage I have given to the jackals of the wilderness.
Malachi,1,4,Though [impoverished] Edom should say We are beaten down but we will return and build the waste places--thus says the Lord of hosts: They may build but I will tear and throw down; and men will call them the Wicked Country the people against whom the Lord has indignation forever.
Malachi,1,5,Your own eyes shall see this and you shall say The Lord is great and will be magnified over and beyond the border of Israel!
Malachi,1,6,A son honors his father and a servant his master. If then I am a Father where is My honor? And if I am a Master where is the [reverent] fear due Me? says the Lord of hosts to you O priests who despise My name. You say How and in what way have we despised Your name?
Malachi,1,7,By offering polluted food upon My altar. And you ask How have we polluted it and profaned You? By thinking that the table of the Lord is contemptible and may be despised.
Malachi,1,8,When you [priests] offer blind [animals] for sacrifice is it not evil? And when you offer the lame and the sick is it not evil? Present such a thing [a blind or lame or sick animal] now to your governor [in payment of your taxes and see what will happen]. Will he be pleased with you? Or will he receive you graciously? says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,1,9,Now then I [Malachi] beg [you priests] entreat God [earnestly] that He will be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand [as a defective animal for sacrifice] will He accept it or show favor to any of you? says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,1,10,Oh that there were even one among you [whose duty it is to minister to Me] who would shut the doors that you might not kindle fire on My altar to no purpose [an empty futile fruitless pretense]! I have no pleasure in you says the Lord of hosts nor will I accept an offering from your hand.
Malachi,1,11,For from the rising of the sun to its setting My name shall be great among the nations and in every place incense shall be offered to My name and indeed a pure offering; for My name shall be great among the nations says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,1,12,But you [priests] profane it when [by your actions] you say The table of the Lord is polluted and the fruit of it its food is contemptible and may be despised.
Malachi,1,13,You say also Behold what a drudgery and weariness this is! And you have sniffed at it says the Lord of hosts. And you have brought that which was taken by violence or the lame or the sick; this you bring as an offering! Shall I accept this from your hand? says the Lord.
Malachi,1,14,But cursed is the [cheating] deceiver who has a male in his flock and vows to offer it yet sacrifices to the [sovereign] Lord a blemished or diseased thing! For I am a great King says the Lord of hosts and My name is terrible and to be [reverently] feared among the nations.
Malachi,2,1,AND NOW O you priests this commandment is for you.
Malachi,2,2,If you will not hear and if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to My name says the Lord of hosts then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings; yes I have already turned them to curses because you do not lay it to heart.
Malachi,2,3,Behold I will rebuke your seed [grain--which will prevent due harvest] and I will spread the dung from the festival offerings upon your faces and you shall be taken away with it.
Malachi,2,4,And you shall know recognize and understand that I have sent this [new] decree to you priests to be My [new] covenant with Levi [the priestly tribe] says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,2,5,My covenant [on My part with Levi] was to give him life and peace because [on his part] of the [reverent and worshipful] fear with which [the priests] would revere Me and stand in awe of My name.
Malachi,2,6,The law of truth was in [Levi's] mouth and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness and turned many away from iniquity.
Malachi,2,7,For the priest's lips should guard and keep pure the knowledge [of My law] and the people should seek (inquire for and require) instruction at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,2,8,But you have turned aside out of the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction [in the law]; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi [with Me] says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,2,9,Therefore have I also made you despised and abased before all the people inasmuch as you have not kept My ways but have shown favoritism to persons in your administration of the law [of God].
Malachi,2,10,Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then do we deal faithlessly and treacherously each against his brother profaning the covenant of [God with] our fathers?
Malachi,2,11,Judah has been faithless and dealt treacherously and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah [that is Jewish men] has profaned the holy sanctuary of the Lord which He loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god [having divorced his Jewish wife].
Malachi,2,12,The Lord will cast out of the tents of Jacob to the last man those who do this [evil thing] the master and the servant [or the pupil] alike even him who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,2,13,And this you do with double guilt; you cover the altar of the Lord with tears [shed by your unoffending wives divorced by you that you might take heathen wives] and with [your own] weeping and crying out because the Lord does not regard your offering any more or accept it with favor at your hand.
Malachi,2,14,Yet you ask Why does He reject it? Because the Lord was witness [to the covenant made at your marriage] between you and the wife of your youth against whom you have dealt treacherously and to whom you were faithless. Yet she is your companion and the wife of your covenant [made by your marriage vows].
Malachi,2,15,And did not God make [you and your wife] one [flesh]? Did not One make you and preserve your spirit alive? And why [did God make you two] one? Because He sought a godly offspring [from your union]. Therefore take heed to yourselves and let no one deal treacherously and be faithless to the wife of his youth.
Malachi,2,16,For the Lord the God of Israel says: I hate divorce and marital separation and him who covers his garment [his wife] with violence. Therefore keep a watch upon your spirit [that it may be controlled by My Spirit] that you deal not treacherously and faithlessly [with your marriage mate].
Malachi,2,17,You have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet you say In what way have we wearied Him? [You do it when by your actions] you say Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord and He delights in them. Or [by asking] Where is the God of justice?
Malachi,3,1,BEHOLD I send My messenger and he shall prepare the way before Me. And the Lord [the Messiah] Whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple; the Messenger or Angel of the covenant Whom you desire behold He shall come says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,3,2,But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap;
Malachi,3,3,He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and He will purify the priests the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver that they may offer to the Lord offerings in righteousness.
Malachi,3,4,Then will the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in ancient years.
Malachi,3,5,Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers against the adulterers against the false swearers and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and who turn aside the temporary resident from his right and fear not Me says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,3,6,For I am the Lord I do not change; that is why you O sons of Jacob are not consumed.
Malachi,3,7,Even from the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My ordinances and have not kept them. Return to me and I will return to you says the Lord of hosts. But you say How shall we return?
Malachi,3,8,Will a man rob or defraud God? Yet you rob and defraud Me. But you say In what way do we rob or defraud You? [You have withheld your] tithes and offerings.
Malachi,3,9,You are cursed with the curse for you are robbing Me even this whole nation.
Malachi,3,10,Bring all the tithes (the whole tenth of your income) into the storehouse that there may be food in My house and prove Me now by it says the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
Malachi,3,11,And I will rebuke the devourer [insects and plagues] for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine drop its fruit before the time in the field says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,3,12,And all nations shall call you happy and blessed for you shall be a land of delight says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,3,13,Your words have been strong and hard against Me says the Lord. Yet you say What have we spoken against You?
Malachi,3,14,You have said It is useless to serve God and what profit is it if we keep His ordinances and walk gloomily and as if in mourning apparel before the Lord of hosts?
Malachi,3,15,And now we consider the proud and arrogant to be happy and favored; evildoers are exalted and prosper; yes and when they test God they escape [unpunished].
Malachi,3,16,Then those who feared the Lord talked often one to another; and the Lord listened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before Him of those who reverenced and worshipfully feared the Lord and who thought on His name.
Malachi,3,17,And they shall be Mine says the Lord of hosts in that day when I publicly recognize and openly declare them to be My jewels (My special possession My peculiar treasure). And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.
Malachi,3,18,Then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him.
Malachi,4,1,FOR BEHOLD the day comes that shall burn like an oven and all the proud and arrogant yes and all that do wickedly and are lawless shall be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up says the Lord of hosts so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
Malachi,4,2,But unto you who revere and worshipfully fear My name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in His wings and His beams and you shall go forth and gambol like calves [released] from the stall and leap for joy.
Malachi,4,3,And you shall tread down the lawless and wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this says the Lord of hosts.
Malachi,4,4,[Earnestly] remember the law of Moses My servant the statutes and the ordinances which I commanded him on [Mount] Horeb [to give] to all Israel.
Malachi,4,5,Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.
Malachi,4,6,And he shall turn and reconcile the hearts of the [estranged] fathers to the [ungodly] children and the hearts of the [rebellious] children to [the piety of] their fathers [a reconciliation produced by repentance of the ungodly] lest I come and smite the land with a curse and a ban of utter destruction.
Matthew,1,1,THE BOOK of the ancestry (genealogy) of Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed) the son (descendant) of David the son (descendant) of Abraham.
Matthew,1,2,Abraham was the father of Isaac Isaac the father of Jacob Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers
Matthew,1,3,Judah the father of Perez and Zerah whose mother was Tamar Perez the father of Hezron Hezron the father of Aram
Matthew,1,4,Aram the father of Aminadab Aminadab the father of Nahshon Nahshon the father of Salmon
Matthew,1,5,Salmon the father of Boaz whose mother was Rahab Boaz the father of Obed whose mother was Ruth Obed the father of Jesse
Matthew,1,6,Jesse the father of King David King David the father of Solomon whose mother had been the wife of Uriah
Matthew,1,7,Solomon the father of Rehoboam Rehoboam the father of Abijah Abijah the father of Asa
Matthew,1,8,Asa the father of Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat the father of Joram [Jehoram] Joram the father of Uzziah
Matthew,1,9,Uzziah the father of Jotham Jotham the father of Ahaz Ahaz the father of Hezekiah
Matthew,1,10,Hezekiah the father of Manasseh Manasseh the father of Amon Amon the father of Josiah
Matthew,1,11,And Josiah became the father of Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] and his brothers about the time of the removal (deportation) to Babylon. [II Kings 24:14; I Chron. 3:15 16.]
Matthew,1,12,After the exile to Babylon Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel [Salathiel] Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel
Matthew,1,13,Zerubbabel the father of Abiud Abiud the father of Eliakim Eliakim the father of Azor
Matthew,1,14,Azor the father of Sadoc Sadoc the father of Achim Achim the father of Eliud
Matthew,1,15,Eliud the father of Eleazar Eleazar the father of Matthan Matthan the father of Jacob
Matthew,1,16,Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus Who is called the Christ. (the Messiah the Anointed)
Matthew,1,17,So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen from David to the Babylonian exile (deportation) fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ fourteen generations.
Matthew,1,18,Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place under these circumstances: When His mother Mary had been promised in marriage to Joseph before they came together she was found to be pregnant [through the power] of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew,1,19,And her [promised] husband Joseph being a just and upright man and not willing to expose her publicly and to shame and disgrace her decided to repudiate and dismiss (divorce) her quietly and secretly.
Matthew,1,20,But as he was thinking this over behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph descendant of David do not be afraid to take Mary [as] your wife for that which is conceived in her is of (from out of) the Holy Spirit.
Matthew,1,21,She will bear a Son and you shall call His name Jesus [the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua which means Savior] for He will save His people from their sins [that is prevent them from failing and missing the true end and scope of life which is God].
Matthew,1,22,All this took place that it might be fulfilled which the Lord had spoken through the prophet
Matthew,1,23,Behold the virgin shall become pregnant and give birth to a Son and they shall call His name Emmanuel--which when translated means God with us.
Matthew,1,24,Then Joseph being aroused from his sleep did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him: he took [her to his side as] his wife.
Matthew,1,25,But he had no union with her as her husband until she had borne her firstborn Son; and he called His name Jesus.
Matthew,2,1,NOW WHEN Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise men [astrologers] from the east came to Jerusalem asking
Matthew,2,2,Where is He Who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east at its rising and have come to worship Him.
Matthew,2,3,When Herod the king heard this he was disturbed and troubled and the whole of Jerusalem with him.
Matthew,2,4,So he called together all the chief priests and learned men (scribes) of the people and anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born.
Matthew,2,5,They replied to him In Bethlehem of Judea for so it is written by the prophet:
Matthew,2,6,And you Bethlehem in the land of Judah you are not in any way least or insignificant among the chief cities of Judah; for from you shall come a Ruler ( Leader) Who will govern and shepherd My people Israel.
Matthew,2,7,Then Herod sent for the wise men [astrologers] secretly and accurately to the last point ascertained from them the time of the appearing of the star [that is how long the star had made itself visible since its rising in the east].
Matthew,2,8,Then he sent them to Bethlehem saying Go and search for the Child carefully and diligently and when you have found Him bring me word that I too may come and worship Him.
Matthew,2,9,When they had listened to the king they went their way and behold the star which had been seen in the east in its rising went before them until it came and stood over the place where the young Child was.
Matthew,2,10,When they saw the star they were thrilled with ecstatic joy.
Matthew,2,11,And on going into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then opening their treasure bags they presented to Him gifts--gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Matthew,2,12,And receiving an answer to their asking they were divinely instructed and warned in a dream not to go back to Herod; so they departed to their own country by a different way.
Matthew,2,13,Now after they had gone behold an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said Get up! [ Tenderly] take unto you the young Child and His mother and flee to Egypt; and remain there till I tell you [otherwise] for Herod intends to search for the Child in order to destroy Him.
Matthew,2,14,And having risen he took the Child and His mother by night and withdrew to Egypt
Matthew,2,15,And remained there until Herod's death. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet Out of Egypt have I called My Son.
Matthew,2,16,Then Herod when he realized that he had been misled by the wise men was furiously enraged and he sent and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that territory who were two years old and under reckoning according to the date which he had investigated diligently and had learned exactly from the wise men.
Matthew,2,17,Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
Matthew,2,18,A voice was heard in Ramah wailing and loud lamentation Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted because they were no more.
Matthew,2,19,But when Herod died behold an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
Matthew,2,20,And said Rise [ tenderly] take unto you the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel for those who sought the Child's life are dead.
Matthew,2,21,Then he awoke and arose and [ tenderly] took the Child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew,2,22,But because he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in the place of his father Herod he was afraid to go there. And being divinely warned in a dream he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
Matthew,2,23,He went and dwelt in a town called Nazareth so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled: He shall be called a Nazarene [Branch Separated One].
Matthew,3,1,IN THOSE days there appeared John the Baptist preaching in the Wilderness (Desert) of Judea
Matthew,3,2,And saying Repent ( think differently; change your mind regretting your sins and changing your conduct) for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew,3,3,This is he who was mentioned by the prophet Isaiah when he said The voice of one crying in the wilderness (shouting in the desert) Prepare the road for the Lord make His highways straight (level direct).
Matthew,3,4,This same John's garments were made of camel's hair and he wore a leather girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew,3,5,Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country round about the Jordan went out to him;
Matthew,3,6,And they were baptized in the Jordan by him confessing their sins.
Matthew,3,7,But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism he said to them You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee and escape from the wrath and indignation [of God against disobedience] that is coming?
Matthew,3,8,Bring forth fruit that is consistent with repentance [let your lives prove your change of heart];
Matthew,3,9,And do not presume to say to yourselves We have Abraham for our forefather; for I tell you God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!
Matthew,3,10,And already the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,3,11,I indeed baptize you in (with) water because of repentance [that is because of your changing your minds for the better heartily amending your ways with abhorrence of your past sins]. But He Who is coming after me is mightier than I Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to take off or carry; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
Matthew,3,12,His winnowing fan (shovel fork) is in His hand and He will thoroughly clear out and clean His threshing floor and gather and store His wheat in His barn but the chaff He will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.
Matthew,3,13,Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.
Matthew,3,14,But John protested strenuously having in mind to prevent Him saying It is I who have need to be baptized by You and do You come to me?
Matthew,3,15,But Jesus replied to him Permit it just now; for this is the fitting way for [both of] us to fulfill all righteousness [that is to perform completely whatever is right]. Then he permitted Him.
Matthew,3,16,And when Jesus was baptized He went up at once out of the water; and behold the heavens were opened and he [John] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on Him.
Matthew,3,17,And behold a voice from heaven said This is My Son My Beloved in Whom I delight!
Matthew,4,1,THEN JESUS was led (guided) by the [Holy] Spirit into the wilderness (desert) to be tempted (tested and tried) by the devil.
Matthew,4,2,And He went without food for forty days and forty nights and later He was hungry.
Matthew,4,3,And the tempter came and said to Him If You are God's Son command these stones to be made [ loaves of] bread.
Matthew,4,4,But He replied It has been written Man shall not live and be upheld and sustained by bread alone but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.
Matthew,4,5,Then the devil took Him into the holy city and placed Him on a turret (pinnacle gable) of the temple sanctuary.
Matthew,4,6,And he said to Him If You are the Son of God throw Yourself down; for it is written He will give His angels charge over you and they will bear you up on their hands lest you strike your foot against a stone.
Matthew,4,7,Jesus said to him On the other hand it is written also You shall not tempt test thoroughly or try exceedingly the Lord your God.
Matthew,4,8,Again the devil took Him up on a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory (the splendor magnificence preeminence and excellence) of them.
Matthew,4,9,And he said to Him These things all taken together I will give You if You will prostrate Yourself before me and do homage and worship me.
Matthew,4,10,Then Jesus said to him Begone Satan! For it has been written You shall worship the Lord your God and Him alone shall you serve.
Matthew,4,11,Then the devil departed from Him and behold angels came and ministered to Him.
Matthew,4,12,Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested and put in prison He withdrew into Galilee.
Matthew,4,13,And leaving Nazareth He went and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali--
Matthew,4,14,That what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be brought to pass:
Matthew,4,15,The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali in the way to the sea beyond the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles [of the peoples who are not of Israel]--
Matthew,4,16,The people who sat (dwelt enveloped) in darkness have seen a great Light and for those who sat in the land and shadow of death Light has dawned.
Matthew,4,17,From that time Jesus began to preach crying out Repent ( change your mind for the better heartily amend your ways with abhorrence of your past sins) for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew,4,18,As He was walking by the Sea of Galilee He noticed two brothers Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother throwing a dragnet into the sea for they were fishermen.
Matthew,4,19,And He said to them Come after Me [as disciples--letting Me be your Guide] follow Me and I will make you fishers of men!
Matthew,4,20,At once they left their nets and became His disciples [sided with His party and followed Him].
Matthew,4,21,And going on further from there He noticed two other brothers James son of Zebedee and his brother John in the boat with their father Zebedee mending their nets and putting them right; and He called them.
Matthew,4,22,At once they left the boat and their father and joined Jesus as disciples [sided with His party and followed Him].
Matthew,4,23,And He went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news (Gospel) of the kingdom and healing every disease and every weakness and infirmity among the people.
Matthew,4,24,So the report of Him spread throughout all Syria and they brought Him all who were sick those afflicted with various diseases and torments those under the power of demons and epileptics and paralyzed people and He healed them.
Matthew,4,25,And great crowds joined and accompanied Him about coming from Galilee and Decapolis [the district of the ten cities east of the Sea of Galilee] and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other [the east] side of the Jordan.
Matthew,5,1,SEEING THE crowds He went up on the mountain; and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.
Matthew,5,2,Then He opened His mouth and taught them saying:
Matthew,5,3,Blessed (happy to be envied and spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward conditions) are the poor in spirit (the humble who rate themselves insignificant) for theirs is the kingdom of heaven!
Matthew,5,4,Blessed and enviably happy [with a happiness produced by the experience of God's favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His matchless grace] are those who mourn for they shall be comforted!
Matthew,5,5,Blessed (happy blithesome joyous spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward conditions) are the meek (the mild patient long-suffering) for they shall inherit the earth!
Matthew,5,6,Blessed and fortunate and happy and spiritually prosperous (in that state in which the born-again child of God enjoys His favor and salvation) are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God) for they shall be completely satisfied!
Matthew,5,7,Blessed (happy to be envied and spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward conditions) are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy!
Matthew,5,8,Blessed (happy enviably fortunate and spiritually prosperous--possessing the happiness produced by the experience of God's favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His grace regardless of their outward conditions) are the pure in heart for they shall see God!
Matthew,5,9,Blessed (enjoying enviable happiness spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward conditions) are the makers and maintainers of peace for they shall be called the sons of God!
Matthew,5,10,Blessed and happy and enviably fortunate and spiritually prosperous (in the state in which the born-again child of God enjoys and finds satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of his outward conditions) are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake (for being and doing right) for theirs is the kingdom of heaven!
Matthew,5,11,Blessed (happy to be envied and spiritually prosperous--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of your outward conditions) are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you falsely on My account.
Matthew,5,12,Be glad and supremely joyful for your reward in heaven is great (strong and intense) for in this same way people persecuted the prophets who were before you. [II Chron. 36:16.]
Matthew,5,13,You are the salt of the earth but if salt has lost its taste (its strength its quality) how can its saltness be restored? It is not good for anything any longer but to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men.
Matthew,5,14,You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Matthew,5,15,Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a peck measure but on a lampstand and it gives light to all in the house.
Matthew,5,16,Let your light so shine before men that they may see your moral excellence and your praiseworthy noble and good deeds and recognize and honor and praise and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,5,17,Do not think that I have come to do away with or undo the Law or the Prophets; I have come not to do away with or undo but to complete and fulfill them.
Matthew,5,18,For truly I tell you until the sky and earth pass away and perish not one smallest letter nor one little hook [identifying certain Hebrew letters] will pass from the Law until all things [it foreshadows] are accomplished.
Matthew,5,19,Whoever then breaks or does away with or relaxes one of the least [important] of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least [important] in the kingdom of heaven but he who practices them and teaches others to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,5,20,For I tell you unless your righteousness (your uprightness and your right standing with God) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,5,21,You have heard that it was said to the men of old You shall not kill and whoever kills shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court.
Matthew,5,22,But I say to you that everyone who continues to be angry with his brother or harbors malice (enmity of heart) against him shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court; and whoever speaks contemptuously and insultingly to his brother shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the Sanhedrin and whoever says You cursed fool! [You empty-headed idiot!] shall be liable to and unable to escape the hell (Gehenna) of fire.
Matthew,5,23,So if when you are offering your gift at the altar you there remember that your brother has any [grievance] against you
Matthew,5,24,Leave your gift at the altar and go. First make peace with your brother and then come back and present your gift.
Matthew,5,25,Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way traveling with him lest your accuser hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you be put in prison.
Matthew,5,26,Truly I say to you you will not be released until you have paid the last fraction of a penny.
Matthew,5,27,You have heard that it was said You shall not commit adultery.
Matthew,5,28,But I say to you that everyone who so much as looks at a woman with evil desire for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew,5,29,If your right eye serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin pluck it out and throw it away. It is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be cast into hell (Gehenna).
Matthew,5,30,And if your right hand serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin cut it off and cast it from you. It is better that you lose one of your members than that your entire body should be cast into hell (Gehenna).
Matthew,5,31,It has also been said Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.
Matthew,5,32,But I tell you Whoever dismisses and repudiates and divorces his wife except on the grounds of unfaithfulness (sexual immorality) causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.
Matthew,5,33,Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old You shall not swear falsely but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord [as a religious duty].
Matthew,5,34,But I tell you Do not bind yourselves by an oath at all: either by heaven for it is the throne of God;
Matthew,5,35,Or by the earth for it is the footstool of His feet; or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the Great King.
Matthew,5,36,And do not swear by your head for you are not able to make a single hair white or black.
Matthew,5,37,Let your Yes be simply Yes and your No be simply No; anything more than that comes from the evil one.
Matthew,5,38,You have heard that it was said An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Matthew,5,39,But I say to you Do not resist the evil man [who injures you]; but if anyone strikes you on the right jaw or cheek turn to him the other one too.
Matthew,5,40,And if anyone wants to sue you and take your undershirt (tunic) let him have your coat also.
Matthew,5,41,And if anyone forces you to go one mile go with him two [miles].
Matthew,5,42,Give to him who keeps on begging from you and do not turn away from him who would borrow [ at interest] from you.
Matthew,5,43,You have heard that it was said You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy;
Matthew,5,44,But I tell you Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
Matthew,5,45,To show that you are the children of your Father Who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the good and makes the rain fall upon the upright and the wrongdoers [alike].
Matthew,5,46,For if you love those who love you what reward can you have? Do not even the tax collectors do that?
Matthew,5,47,And if you greet only your brethren what more than others are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles (the heathen) do that?
Matthew,5,48,You therefore must be perfect [growing into complete maturity of godliness in mind and character having reached the proper height of virtue and integrity] as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Matthew,6,1,TAKE CARE not to do your good deeds publicly or before men in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward [ reserved for and awaiting you] with and from your Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,6,2,Thus whenever you give to the poor do not blow a trumpet before you as the hypocrites in the synagogues and in the streets like to do that they may be recognized and honored and praised by men. Truly I tell you they have their reward in full already.
Matthew,6,3,But when you give to charity do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
Matthew,6,4,So that your deeds of charity may be in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you openly.
Matthew,6,5,Also when you pray you must not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets that they may be seen by people. Truly I tell you they have their reward in full already.
Matthew,6,6,But when you pray go into your [most] private room and closing the door pray to your Father Who is in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you in the open.
Matthew,6,7,And when you pray do not heap up phrases (multiply words repeating the same ones over and over) as the Gentiles do for they think they will be heard for their much speaking. [I Kings 18:25-29.]
Matthew,6,8,Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Matthew,6,9,Pray therefore like this: Our Father Who is in heaven hallowed (kept holy) be Your name.
Matthew,6,10,Your kingdom come Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Matthew,6,11,Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew,6,12,And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven ( left remitted and let go of the debts and have given up resentment against) our debtors.
Matthew,6,13,And lead (bring) us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
Matthew,6,14,For if you forgive people their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins leaving them letting them go and giving up resentment] your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
Matthew,6,15,But if you do not forgive others their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins leaving them letting them go and giving up resentment] neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses.
Matthew,6,16,And whenever you are fasting do not look gloomy and sour and dreary like the hypocrites for they put on a dismal countenance that their fasting may be apparent to and seen by men. Truly I say to you they have their reward in full already.
Matthew,6,17,But when you fast perfume your head and wash your face
Matthew,6,18,So that your fasting may not be noticed by men but by your Father Who sees in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you in the open.
Matthew,6,19,Do not gather and heap up and store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust and worm consume and destroy and where thieves break through and steal.
Matthew,6,20,But gather and heap up and store for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust nor worm consume and destroy and where thieves do not break through and steal;
Matthew,6,21,For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.
Matthew,6,22,The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is sound your entire body will be full of light.
Matthew,6,23,But if your eye is unsound your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the very light in you [your conscience] is darkened how dense is that darkness!
Matthew,6,24,No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise and be against the other. You cannot serve God and mammon ( deceitful riches money possessions or whatever is trusted in).
Matthew,6,25,Therefore I tell you stop being perpetually uneasy (anxious and worried) about your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink; or about your body what you shall put on. Is not life greater [in quality] than food and the body [far above and more excellent] than clothing?
Matthew,6,26,Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them. Are you not worth much more than they?
Matthew,6,27,And who of you by worrying and being anxious can add one unit of measure (cubit) to his stature or to the span of his life?
Matthew,6,28,And why should you be anxious about clothes? Consider the lilies of the field and learn thoroughly how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.
Matthew,6,29,Yet I tell you even Solomon in all his magnificence (excellence dignity and grace) was not arrayed like one of these. [I Kings 10:4-7.]
Matthew,6,30,But if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is alive and green and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace will He not much more surely clothe you O you of little faith?
Matthew,6,31,Therefore do not worry and be anxious saying What are we going to have to eat? or What are we going to have to drink? or What are we going to have to wear?
Matthew,6,32,For the Gentiles (heathen) wish for and crave and diligently seek all these things and your heavenly Father knows well that you need them all.
Matthew,6,33,But seek ( aim at and strive after) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness ( His way of doing and being right) and then all these things taken together will be given you besides.
Matthew,6,34,So do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will have worries and anxieties of its own. Sufficient for each day is its own trouble.
Matthew,7,1,DO NOT judge and criticize and condemn others so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves.
Matthew,7,2,For just as you judge and criticize and condemn others you will be judged and criticized and condemned and in accordance with the measure you [use to] deal out to others it will be dealt out again to you.
Matthew,7,3,Why do you stare from without at the very small particle that is in your brother's eye but do not become aware of and consider the beam of timber that is in your own eye?
Matthew,7,4,Or how can you say to your brother Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye when there is the beam of timber in your own eye?
Matthew,7,5,You hypocrite first get the beam of timber out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother's eye.
Matthew,7,6,Do not give that which is holy (the sacred thing) to the dogs and do not throw your pearls before hogs lest they trample upon them with their feet and turn and tear you in pieces.
Matthew,7,7,Keep on asking and it will be given you; keep on seeking and you will find; keep on knocking [reverently] and [the door] will be opened to you.
Matthew,7,8,For everyone who keeps on asking receives; and he who keeps on seeking finds; and to him who keeps on knocking [the door] will be opened.
Matthew,7,9,Or what man is there of you if his son asks him for a loaf of bread will hand him a stone?
Matthew,7,10,Or if he asks for a fish will hand him a serpent?
Matthew,7,11,If you then evil as you are know how to give good and advantageous gifts to your children how much more will your Father Who is in heaven [perfect as He is] give good and advantageous things to those who keep on asking Him!
Matthew,7,12,So then whatever you desire that others would do to and for you even so do also to and for them for this is (sums up) the Law and the Prophets.
Matthew,7,13,Enter through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and spacious and broad is the way that leads away to destruction and many are those who are entering through it.
Matthew,7,14,But the gate is narrow (contracted by pressure) and the way is straitened and compressed that leads away to life and few are those who find it.
Matthew,7,15,Beware of false prophets who come to you dressed as sheep but inside they are devouring wolves.
Matthew,7,16,You will fully recognize them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?
Matthew,7,17,Even so every healthy (sound) tree bears good fruit [ worthy of admiration] but the sickly (decaying worthless) tree bears bad (worthless) fruit.
Matthew,7,18,A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration].
Matthew,7,19,Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
Matthew,7,20,Therefore you will fully know them by their fruits.
Matthew,7,21,Not everyone who says to Me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,7,22,Many will say to Me on that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name?
Matthew,7,23,And then I will say to them openly (publicly) I never knew you; depart from Me you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands].
Matthew,7,24,So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them [obeying them] will be like a sensible (prudent practical wise) man who built his house upon the rock.
Matthew,7,25,And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock.
Matthew,7,26,And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them will be like a stupid (foolish) man who built his house upon the sand.
Matthew,7,27,And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell--and great and complete was the fall of it.
Matthew,7,28,When Jesus had finished these sayings [the Sermon on the Mount] the crowds were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His teaching
Matthew,7,29,For He was teaching as One Who had [and was] authority and not as [did] the scribes.
Matthew,8,1,WHEN JESUS came down from the mountain great throngs followed Him.
Matthew,8,2,And behold a leper came up to Him and prostrating himself worshiped Him saying Lord if You are willing You are able to cleanse me by curing me.
Matthew,8,3,And He reached out His hand and touched him saying I am willing; be cleansed by being cured. And instantly his leprosy was cured and cleansed.
Matthew,8,4,And Jesus said to him See that you tell nothing about this to anyone; but go show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded for a testimony [to your healing] and as an evidence to the people.
Matthew,8,5,As Jesus went into Capernaum a centurion came up to Him begging Him
Matthew,8,6,And saying Lord my servant boy is lying at the house paralyzed and distressed with intense pains.
Matthew,8,7,And Jesus said to him I will come and restore him.
Matthew,8,8,But the centurion replied to Him Lord I am not worthy or fit to have You come under my roof; but only speak the word and my servant boy will be cured.
Matthew,8,9,For I also am a man subject to authority with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one Go and he goes; and to another Come and he comes; and to my slave Do this and he does it.
Matthew,8,10,When Jesus heard him He marveled and said to those who followed Him [ who adhered steadfastly to Him conforming to His example in living and if need be in dying also] I tell you truly I have not found so much faith as this with anyone even in Israel.
Matthew,8,11,I tell you many will come from east and west and will sit at table with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
Matthew,8,12,While the sons and heirs of the kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,8,13,Then to the centurion Jesus said Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed. And the servant boy was restored to health at that very moment.
Matthew,8,14,And when Jesus went into Peter's house He saw his mother-in-law lying ill with a fever.
Matthew,8,15,He touched her hand and the fever left her; and she got up and began waiting on Him.
Matthew,8,16,When evening came they brought to Him many who were under the power of demons and He drove out the spirits with a word and restored to health all who were sick.
Matthew,8,17,And thus He fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah He Himself took [ in order to carry away] our weaknesses and infirmities and bore away our diseases.
Matthew,8,18,Now Jesus when He saw the great throngs around Him gave orders to cross to the other side [of the lake].
Matthew,8,19,And a scribe came up and said to Him Master I will accompany You wherever You go.
Matthew,8,20,And Jesus replied to him Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have lodging places but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.
Matthew,8,21,Another of the disciples said to Him Lord let me first go and bury [ care for till death] my father.
Matthew,8,22,But Jesus said to him Follow Me and leave the dead [ in sin] to bury their own dead.
Matthew,8,23,And after He got into the boat His disciples followed Him.
Matthew,8,24,And suddenly behold there arose a violent storm on the sea so that the boat was being covered up by the waves; but He was sleeping.
Matthew,8,25,And they went and awakened Him saying Lord rescue and preserve us! We are perishing!
Matthew,8,26,And He said to them Why are you timid and afraid O you of little faith? Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great and wonderful calm ( a perfect peaceableness).
Matthew,8,27,And the men were stunned with bewildered wonder and marveled saying What kind of Man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him!
Matthew,8,28,And when He arrived at the other side in the country of the Gadarenes two men under the control of demons went to meet Him coming out of the tombs so fierce and savage that no one was able to pass that way.
Matthew,8,29,And behold they shrieked and screamed What have You to do with us Jesus Son of God? Have You come to torment us before the appointed time?
Matthew,8,30,Now at some distance from there a drove of many hogs was grazing.
Matthew,8,31,And the demons begged Him If You drive us out send us into the drove of hogs.
Matthew,8,32,And He said to them Begone! So they came out and went into the hogs and behold the whole drove rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water.
Matthew,8,33,The herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything including what had happened to the men under the power of demons.
Matthew,8,34,And behold the whole town went out to meet Jesus; and as soon as they saw Him they begged Him to depart from their locality.
Matthew,9,1,AND JESUS getting into a boat crossed to the other side and came to His own town [Capernaum].
Matthew,9,2,And behold they brought to Him a man paralyzed and prostrated by illness lying on a sleeping pad; and when Jesus saw their faith He said to the paralyzed man Take courage son; your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted.
Matthew,9,3,And behold some of the scribes said to themselves This man blasphemes [He claims the rights and prerogatives of God]!
Matthew,9,4,But Jesus knowing ( seeing) their thoughts said Why do you think evil and harbor malice in your hearts?
Matthew,9,5,For which is easier: to say Your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted or to say Get up and walk?
Matthew,9,6,But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins and remit the penalty He then said to the paralyzed man Get up! Pick up your sleeping pad and go to your own house.
Matthew,9,7,And he got up and went away to his own house.
Matthew,9,8,When the crowds saw it they were struck with fear and awe; and they recognized God and praised and thanked Him Who had given such power and authority to men.
Matthew,9,9,As Jesus passed on from there He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's office; and He said to him Be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me]. And he rose and followed Him.
Matthew,9,10,And as Jesus reclined at table in the house behold many tax collectors and [especially wicked] sinners came and sat (reclined) with Him and His disciples.
Matthew,9,11,And when the Pharisees saw this they said to His disciples Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and those [preeminently] sinful?
Matthew,9,12,But when Jesus heard it He replied Those who are strong and well (healthy) have no need of a physician but those who are weak and sick.
Matthew,9,13,Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy [that is readiness to help those in trouble] and not sacrifice and sacrificial victims. For I came not to call and invite [to repentance] the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) but sinners (the erring ones and all those not free from sin).
Matthew,9,14,Then the disciples of John came to Jesus inquiring Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast often [that is abstain from food and drink as a religious exercise] but Your disciples do not fast?
Matthew,9,15,And Jesus replied to them Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast.
Matthew,9,16,And no one puts a piece of cloth that has not been shrunk on an old garment for such a patch tears away from the garment and a worse rent (tear) is made.
Matthew,9,17,Neither is new wine put in old wineskins; for if it is the skins burst and are torn in pieces and the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins and so both are preserved.
Matthew,9,18,While He was talking this way to them behold a ruler entered and kneeling down worshiped Him saying My daughter has just now died; but come and lay Your hand on her and she will come to life.
Matthew,9,19,And Jesus got up and accompanied him with His disciples.
Matthew,9,20,And behold a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment;
Matthew,9,21,For she kept saying to herself If I only touch His garment I shall be restored to health.
Matthew,9,22,Jesus turned around and seeing her He said Take courage daughter! Your faith has made you well. And at once the woman was restored to health.
Matthew,9,23,And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making an uproar and din
Matthew,9,24,He said Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping. And they laughed and jeered at Him.
Matthew,9,25,But when the crowd had been ordered to go outside He went in and took her by the hand and the girl arose.
Matthew,9,26,And the news about this spread through all that district.
Matthew,9,27,As Jesus passed on from there two blind men followed Him shouting loudly Have pity and mercy on us Son of David!
Matthew,9,28,When He reached the house and went in the blind men came to Him and Jesus said to them Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him Yes Lord.
Matthew,9,29,Then He touched their eyes saying According to your faith and trust and reliance [on the power invested in Me] be it done to you;
Matthew,9,30,And their eyes were opened. And Jesus earnestly and sternly charged them See that you let no one know about this.
Matthew,9,31,But they went off and blazed and spread His fame abroad throughout that whole district.
Matthew,9,32,And while they were going away behold a dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus.
Matthew,9,33,And when the demon was driven out the dumb man spoke; and the crowds were stunned with bewildered wonder saying Never before has anything like this been seen in Israel.
Matthew,9,34,But the Pharisees said He drives out demons through and with the help of the prince of demons.
Matthew,9,35,And Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and every weakness and infirmity.
Matthew,9,36,When He saw the throngs He was moved with pity and sympathy for them because they were bewildered (harassed and distressed and dejected and helpless) like sheep without a shepherd.
Matthew,9,37,Then He said to His disciples The harvest is indeed plentiful but the laborers are few.
Matthew,9,38,So pray to the Lord of the harvest to force out and thrust laborers into His harvest.
Matthew,10,1,AND JESUS summoned to Him His twelve disciples and gave them power and authority over unclean spirits to drive them out and to cure all kinds of disease and all kinds of weakness and infirmity.
Matthew,10,2,Now these are the names of the twelve apostles (special messengers): first Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee and John his brother;
Matthew,10,3,Philip and Bartholomew [Nathaniel]; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus [Judas not Iscariot];
Matthew,10,4,Simon the Cananaean and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed Him.
Matthew,10,5,Jesus sent out these twelve charging them Go nowhere among the Gentiles and do not go into any town of the Samaritans;
Matthew,10,6,But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew,10,7,And as you go preach saying The kingdom of heaven is at hand!
Matthew,10,8,Cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers drive out demons. Freely (without pay) you have received freely (without charge) give.
Matthew,10,9,Take no gold nor silver nor [even] copper money in your purses (belts);
Matthew,10,10,And do not take a provision bag or a wallet for a collection bag for your journey nor two undergarments nor sandals nor a staff; for the workman deserves his support (his living his food).
Matthew,10,11,And into whatever town or village you go inquire who in it is deserving and stay there [at his house] until you leave [that vicinity].
Matthew,10,12,As you go into the house give your greetings and wish it well.
Matthew,10,13,Then if indeed that house is deserving let come upon it your peace [that is freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin]. But if it is not deserving let your peace return to you.
Matthew,10,14,And whoever will not receive and accept and welcome you nor listen to your message as you leave that house or town shake the dust [of it] from your feet.
Matthew,10,15,Truly I tell you it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
Matthew,10,16,Behold I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves; be wary and wise as serpents and be innocent (harmless guileless and without falsity) as doves.
Matthew,10,17,Be on guard against men [whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God]; for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues
Matthew,10,18,And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake as a witness to bear testimony before them and to the Gentiles (the nations).
Matthew,10,19,But when they deliver you up do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak; for what you are to say will be given you in that very hour and moment
Matthew,10,20,For it is not you who are speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Matthew,10,21,Brother will deliver up brother to death and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and will have them put to death.
Matthew,10,22,And you will be hated by all for My name's sake but he who perseveres and endures to the end will be saved [ from spiritual disease and death in the world to come].
Matthew,10,23,When they persecute you in one town [that is pursue you in a manner that would injure you and cause you to suffer because of your belief] flee to another town; for truly I tell you you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
Matthew,10,24,A disciple is not above his teacher nor is a servant or slave above his master.
Matthew,10,25,It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his teacher and the servant or slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub [ master of the dwelling] how much more will they speak evil of those of His household. [II Kings 1:2.]
Matthew,10,26,So have no fear of them; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed or kept secret that will not become known.
Matthew,10,27,What I say to you in the dark tell in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear proclaim upon the housetops.
Matthew,10,28,And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be afraid of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell (Gehenna).
Matthew,10,29,Are not two little sparrows sold for a penny? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's leave (consent) and notice.
Matthew,10,30,But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew,10,31,Fear not then; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew,10,32,Therefore everyone who acknowledges Me before men and confesses Me [ out of a state of oneness with Me] I will also acknowledge him before My Father Who is in heaven and confess [that I am abiding in] him.
Matthew,10,33,But whoever denies and disowns Me before men I also will deny and disown him before My Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,10,34,Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth; I have not come to bring peace but a sword.
Matthew,10,35,For I have come to part asunder a man from his father and a daughter from her mother and a newly married wife from her mother-in-law--
Matthew,10,36,And a man's foes will be they of his own household.
Matthew,10,37,He who loves [and takes more pleasure in] father or mother more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves [and takes more pleasure in] son or daughter more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me;
Matthew,10,38,And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [ cleave steadfastly to Me conforming wholly to My example in living and if need be in dying also] is not worthy of Me.
Matthew,10,39,Whoever finds his [ lower] life will lose it [the higher life] and whoever loses his [lower] life on My account will find it [the higher life].
Matthew,10,40,He who receives and welcomes and accepts you receives and welcomes and accepts Me and he who receives and welcomes and accepts Me receives and welcomes and accepts Him Who sent Me.
Matthew,10,41,He who receives and welcomes and accepts a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he who receives and welcomes and accepts a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
Matthew,10,42,And whoever gives to one of these little ones [in rank or influence] even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple surely I declare to you he shall not lose his reward.
Matthew,11,1,WHEN JESUS had finished His charge to His twelve disciples He left there to teach and to preach in their [Galilean] cities.
Matthew,11,2,Now when John in prison heard about the activities of Christ he sent a message by his disciples
Matthew,11,3,And asked Him Are You the One Who was to come or should we keep on expecting a different one?
Matthew,11,4,And Jesus replied to them Go and report to John what you hear and see:
Matthew,11,5,The blind receive their sight and the lame walk lepers are cleansed (by healing) and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have good news (the Gospel) preached to them.
Matthew,11,6,And blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) is he who takes no offense at Me and finds no cause for stumbling in or through Me and is not hindered from seeing the Truth.
Matthew,11,7,Then as these men went their way Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out in the wilderness (desert) to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
Matthew,11,8,What did you go out to see then? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.
Matthew,11,9,But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes I tell you and one [ out of the common more eminent more remarkable and] superior to a prophet.
Matthew,11,10,This is the one of whom it is written Behold I send My messenger ahead of You who shall make ready Your way before You.
Matthew,11,11,Truly I tell you among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew,11,12,And from the days of John the Baptist until the present time the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault and violent men seize it by force [as a precious prize--a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion].
Matthew,11,13,For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied up until John.
Matthew,11,14,And if you are willing to receive and accept it John himself is Elijah who was to come [before the kingdom].
Matthew,11,15,He who has ears to hear let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing.
Matthew,11,16,But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their playmates
Matthew,11,17,We piped to you [playing wedding] and you did not dance; we wailed dirges [playing funeral] and you did not mourn and beat your breasts and weep aloud.
Matthew,11,18,For John came neither eating nor drinking [with others] and they say He has a demon!
Matthew,11,19,The Son of Man came eating and drinking [with others] and they say Behold a glutton and a wine drinker a friend of tax collectors and [ especially wicked] sinners! Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by what she does (her deeds) and by her children.
Matthew,11,20,Then He began to censure and reproach the cities in which most of His mighty works had been performed because they did not repent [and their hearts were not changed].
Matthew,11,21,Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes [and their hearts would have been changed].
Matthew,11,22,I tell you [further] it shall be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew,11,23,And you Capernaum are you to be lifted up to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades [the region of the dead]! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom it would have continued until today.
Matthew,11,24,But I tell you it shall be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew,11,25,At that time Jesus began to say I thank You Father Lord of heaven and earth [and I acknowledge openly and joyfully to Your honor] that You have hidden these things from the wise and clever and learned and revealed them to babies [to the childish untaught and unskilled].
Matthew,11,26,Yes Father [I praise You that] such was Your gracious will and good pleasure.
Matthew,11,27,All things have been entrusted and delivered to Me by My Father; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Son except the Father and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son deliberately wills to make Him known.
Matthew,11,28,Come to Me all you who labor and are heavy-laden and overburdened and I will cause you to rest. [I will ease and relieve and refresh your souls.]
Matthew,11,29,Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me for I am gentle (meek) and humble (lowly) in heart and you will find rest ( relief and ease and refreshment and recreation and blessed quiet) for your souls.
Matthew,11,30,For My yoke is wholesome (useful good--not harsh hard sharp or pressing but comfortable gracious and pleasant) and My burden is light and easy to be borne.
Matthew,12,1,AT THAT particular time Jesus went through the fields of standing grain on the Sabbath; and His disciples were hungry and they began to pick off the spikes of grain and to eat.
Matthew,12,2,And when the Pharisees saw it they said to Him See there! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful and not permitted on the Sabbath.
Matthew,12,3,He said to them Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry and those who accompanied him--
Matthew,12,4,How he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the showbread--which was not lawful for him to eat nor for the men who accompanied him but for the priests only?
Matthew,12,5,Or have you never read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath [breaking it] and yet are guiltless?
Matthew,12,6,But I tell you Something greater and more exalted and more majestic than the temple is here!
Matthew,12,7,And if you had only known what this saying means I desire mercy [readiness to help to spare to forgive] rather than sacrifice and sacrificial victims you would not have condemned the guiltless.
Matthew,12,8,For the Son of Man is Lord [even] of the Sabbath.
Matthew,12,9,And going on from there He went into their synagogue.
Matthew,12,10,And behold a man was there with one withered hand. And they said to Him Is it lawful or allowable to cure people on the Sabbath days?--that they might accuse Him.
Matthew,12,11,But He said to them What man is there among you if he has only one sheep and it falls into a pit or ditch on the Sabbath will not take hold of it and lift it out?
Matthew,12,12,How much better and of more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful and allowable to do good on the Sabbath days.
Matthew,12,13,Then He said to the man Reach out your hand. And the man reached it out and it was restored as sound as the other one.
Matthew,12,14,But the Pharisees went out and held a consultation against Him how they might do away with Him.
Matthew,12,15,But being aware of this Jesus went away from there. And many people joined and accompanied Him and He cured all of them
Matthew,12,16,And strictly charged them and sharply warned them not to make Him publicly known.
Matthew,12,17,This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah
Matthew,12,18,Behold My Servant Whom I have chosen My Beloved in and with Whom My soul is well pleased and has found its delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him and He shall proclaim and show forth justice to the nations.
Matthew,12,19,He will not strive or wrangle or cry out loudly; nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets;
Matthew,12,20,A bruised reed He will not break and a smoldering (dimly burning) wick He will not quench till He brings justice and a just cause to victory.
Matthew,12,21,And in and on His name will the Gentiles (the peoples outside of Israel) set their hopes.
Matthew,12,22,Then a blind and dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus and He cured him so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw.
Matthew,12,23,And all the [crowds of] people were stunned with bewildered wonder and said This cannot be the Son of David can it?
Matthew,12,24,But the Pharisees hearing it said This Man drives out demons only by and with the help of Beelzebub the prince of demons.
Matthew,12,25,And knowing their thoughts He said to them Any kingdom that is divided against itself is being brought to desolation and laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will last or continue to stand.
Matthew,12,26,And if Satan drives out Satan he has become divided against himself and disunified; how then will his kingdom last or continue to stand?
Matthew,12,27,And if I drive out the demons by [help of] Beelzebub by whose [help] do your sons drive them out? For this reason they shall be your judges.
Matthew,12,28,But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out the demons then the kingdom of God has come upon you [ before you expected it].
Matthew,12,29,Or how can a person go into a strong man's house and carry off his goods (the entire equipment of his house) without first binding the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.
Matthew,12,30,He who is not with Me [definitely on My side] is against Me and he who does not [definitely] gather with Me and for My side scatters.
Matthew,12,31,Therefore I tell you every sin and blasphemy (every evil abusive injurious speaking or indignity against sacred things) can be forgiven men but blasphemy against the [Holy] Spirit shall not and cannot be forgiven.
Matthew,12,32,And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the Spirit the Holy One will not be forgiven either in this world and age or in the world and age to come.
Matthew,12,33,Either make the tree sound (healthy and good) and its fruit sound (healthy and good) or make the tree rotten (diseased and bad) and its fruit rotten (diseased and bad); for the tree is known and recognized and judged by its fruit.
Matthew,12,34,You offspring of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil (wicked)? For out of the fullness (the overflow the superabundance) of the heart the mouth speaks.
Matthew,12,35,The good man from his inner good treasure flings forth good things and the evil man out of his inner evil storehouse flings forth evil things.
Matthew,12,36,But I tell you on the day of judgment men will have to give account for every idle (inoperative nonworking) word they speak.
Matthew,12,37,For by your words you will be justified and acquitted and by your words you will be condemned and sentenced.
Matthew,12,38,Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him Teacher we desire to see a sign or miracle from You [proving that You are what You claim to be].
Matthew,12,39,But He replied to them An evil and adulterous generation (a generation morally unfaithful to God) seeks and demands a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
Matthew,12,40,For even as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew,12,41,The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold Someone more and greater than Jonah is here!
Matthew,12,42,The queen of the South will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon and behold Someone more and greater than Solomon is here. [I Kings 10:1; II Chron. 9:1.]
Matthew,12,43,But when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man it roams through dry [arid] places in search of rest but it does not find any.
Matthew,12,44,Then it says I will go back to my house from which I came out. And when it arrives it finds the place unoccupied swept put in order and decorated.
Matthew,12,45,Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and make their home there. And the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. So also shall it be with this wicked generation.
Matthew,12,46,Jesus was still speaking to the people when behold His mother and brothers stood outside seeking to speak to Him.
Matthew,12,47,Someone said to Him Listen! Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.
Matthew,12,48,But He replied to the man who told Him Who is My mother and who are My brothers?
Matthew,12,49,And stretching out His hand toward [not only the twelve disciples but all] His adherents He said Here are My mother and My brothers.
Matthew,12,50,For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother!
Matthew,13,1,THAT SAME day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea.
Matthew,13,2,But such great crowds gathered about Him that He got into a boat and remained sitting there while all the throng stood on the shore.
Matthew,13,3,And He told them many things in parables (stories by way of illustration and comparison) saying A sower went out to sow.
Matthew,13,4,And as he sowed some seeds fell by the roadside and the birds came and ate them up.
Matthew,13,5,Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they had not much soil; and at once they sprang up because they had no depth of soil.
Matthew,13,6,But when the sun rose they were scorched and because they had no root they dried up and withered away.
Matthew,13,7,Other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them out.
Matthew,13,8,Other seeds fell on good soil and yielded grain--some a hundred times as much as was sown some sixty times as much and some thirty.
Matthew,13,9,He who has ears [to hear] let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing.
Matthew,13,10,Then the disciples came to Him and said Why do You speak to them in parables?
Matthew,13,11,And He replied to them To you it has been given to know the secrets and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given.
Matthew,13,12,For whoever has [spiritual knowledge] to him will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have abundance; but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away.
Matthew,13,13,This is the reason that I speak to them in parables: because having the power of seeing they do not see; and having the power of hearing they do not hear nor do they grasp and understand.
Matthew,13,14,In them indeed is the process of fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah which says: You shall indeed hear and hear but never grasp and understand; and you shall indeed look and look but never see and perceive.
Matthew,13,15,For this nation's heart has grown gross (fat and dull) and their ears heavy and difficult of hearing and their eyes they have tightly closed lest they see and perceive with their eyes and hear and comprehend the sense with their ears and grasp and understand with their heart and turn and I should heal them.
Matthew,13,16,But blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) are your eyes because they do see and your ears because they do hear.
Matthew,13,17,Truly I tell you many prophets and righteous men [men who were upright and in right standing with God] yearned to see what you see and did not see it and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.
Matthew,13,18,Listen then to the [meaning of the] parable of the sower:
Matthew,13,19,While anyone is hearing the Word of the kingdom and does not grasp and comprehend it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the roadside.
Matthew,13,20,As for what was sown on thin (rocky) soil this is he who hears the Word and at once welcomes and accepts it with joy;
Matthew,13,21,Yet it has no real root in him but is temporary (inconstant lasts but a little while); and when affliction or trouble or persecution comes on account of the Word at once he is caused to stumble [he is repelled and begins to distrust and desert Him Whom he ought to trust and obey] and he falls away.
Matthew,13,22,As for what was sown among thorns this is he who hears the Word but the cares of the world and the pleasure and delight and glamour and deceitfulness of riches choke and suffocate the Word and it yields no fruit.
Matthew,13,23,As for what was sown on good soil this is he who hears the Word and grasps and comprehends it; he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundred times as much as was sown in another sixty times as much and in another thirty.
Matthew,13,24,Another parable He set forth before them saying The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
Matthew,13,25,But while he was sleeping his enemy came and sowed also darnel (weeds resembling wheat) among the wheat and went on his way.
Matthew,13,26,So when the plants sprouted and formed grain the darnel (weeds) appeared also.
Matthew,13,27,And the servants of the owner came to him and said Sir did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have darnel shoots in it?
Matthew,13,28,He replied to them An enemy has done this. The servants said to him Then do you want us to go and weed them out?
Matthew,13,29,But he said No lest in gathering the wild wheat (weeds resembling wheat) you root up the [true] wheat along with it.
Matthew,13,30,Let them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers Gather the darnel first and bind it in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my granary.
Matthew,13,31,Another story by way of comparison He set forth before them saying The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
Matthew,13,32,Of all the seeds it is the smallest but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and find shelter in its branches.
Matthew,13,33,He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven ( sour dough) which a woman took and covered over in three measures of meal or flour till all of it was leavened.
Matthew,13,34,These things all taken together Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed without a parable He said nothing to them.
Matthew,13,35,This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet: I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world.
Matthew,13,36,Then He left the throngs and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him saying Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field.
Matthew,13,37,He answered He Who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
Matthew,13,38,The field is the world and the good seed means the children of the kingdom; the darnel is the children of the evil one
Matthew,13,39,And the enemy who sowed it is the devil. The harvest is the close and consummation of the age and the reapers are angels.
Matthew,13,40,Just as the darnel (weeds resembling wheat) is gathered and burned with fire so it will be at the close of the age.
Matthew,13,41,The Son of Man will send forth His angels and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of offense [ persons by whom others are drawn into error or sin] and all who do iniquity and act wickedly
Matthew,13,42,And will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,13,43,Then will the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears [to hear] be listening and let him consider and perceive and understand by hearing.
Matthew,13,44,The kingdom of heaven is like something precious buried in a field which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field.
Matthew,13,45,Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine and precious pearls
Matthew,13,46,Who on finding a single pearl of great price went and sold all he had and bought it.
Matthew,13,47,Again the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was cast into the sea and gathered in fish of every sort.
Matthew,13,48,When it was full men dragged it up on the beach and sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets but the worthless ones they threw away.
Matthew,13,49,So it will be at the close and consummation of the age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God)
Matthew,13,50,And cast them [the wicked] into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,13,51,Have you understood all these things [parables] taken together? They said to Him Yes Lord.
Matthew,13,52,He said to them Therefore every teacher and interpreter of the Sacred Writings who has been instructed about and trained for the kingdom of heaven and has become a disciple is like a householder who brings forth out of his storehouse treasure that is new and [treasure that is] old [the fresh as well as the familiar].
Matthew,13,53,When Jesus had finished these parables (these comparisons) He left there.
Matthew,13,54,And coming to His own country [Nazareth] He taught in their synagogue so that they were amazed with bewildered wonder and said Where did this Man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
Matthew,13,55,Is not this the carpenter's Son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew,13,56,And do not all His sisters live here among us? Where then did this Man get all this?
Matthew,13,57,And they took offense at Him [they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging His authority and caused to stumble]. But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.
Matthew,13,58,And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief (their lack of faith in the divine mission of Jesus).
Matthew,14,1,AT THAT time Herod the governor heard the reports about Jesus
Matthew,14,2,And he said to his attendants This is John the Baptist; He has been raised from the dead and that is why the powers of performing miracles are at work in Him.
Matthew,14,3,For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison [to stow him out of the way] on account and for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip's wife
Matthew,14,4,For John had said to him It is not lawful or right for you to have her.
Matthew,14,5,Although he wished to have him put to death he was afraid of the people for they regarded John as a prophet.
Matthew,14,6,But when Herod's birthday came the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst [before the company] and pleased and fascinated Herod
Matthew,14,7,And so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
Matthew,14,8,And she being put forward and prompted by her mother said Give me the head of John the Baptist right here on a platter.
Matthew,14,9,And the king was distressed and sorry but because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her;
Matthew,14,10,He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
Matthew,14,11,And his head was brought in on a platter and given to the little maid and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew,14,12,And John's disciples came and took up the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
Matthew,14,13,When Jesus heard it He withdrew from there privately in a boat to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard of it they followed Him [by land] on foot from the towns.
Matthew,14,14,When He went ashore and saw a great throng of people He had compassion (pity and deep sympathy) for them and cured their sick.
Matthew,14,15,When evening came the disciples came to Him and said This is a remote and barren place and the day is now over; send the throngs away into the villages to buy food for themselves.
Matthew,14,16,Jesus said They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.
Matthew,14,17,They said to Him We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.
Matthew,14,18,He said Bring them here to Me.
Matthew,14,19,Then He ordered the crowds to recline on the grass; and He took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven He gave thanks and blessed and broke the loaves and handed the pieces to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people.
Matthew,14,20,And they all ate and were satisfied. And they picked up twelve [ small hand] baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Matthew,14,21,And those who ate were about 5000 men not including women and children.
Matthew,14,22,Then He directed the disciples to get into the boat and go before Him to the other side while He sent away the crowds.
Matthew,14,23,And after He had dismissed the multitudes He went up into the hills by Himself to pray. When it was evening He was still there alone.
Matthew,14,24,But the boat was by this time out on the sea many furlongs [a furlong is one-eighth of a mile] distant from the land beaten and tossed by the waves for the wind was against them.
Matthew,14,25,And in the fourth watch [between 3:00--6:00 a.m.] of the night Jesus came to them walking on the sea.
Matthew,14,26,And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea they were terrified and said It is a ghost! And they screamed out with fright.
Matthew,14,27,But instantly He spoke to them saying Take courage! I AM! Stop being afraid!
Matthew,14,28,And Peter answered Him Lord if it is You command me to come to You on the water.
Matthew,14,29,He said Come! So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and he came toward Jesus.
Matthew,14,30,But when he perceived and felt the strong wind he was frightened and as he began to sink he cried out Lord save me [from death]!
Matthew,14,31,Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him saying to him O you of little faith why did you doubt?
Matthew,14,32,And when they got into the boat the wind ceased.
Matthew,14,33,And those in the boat knelt and worshiped Him saying Truly You are the Son of God!
Matthew,14,34,And when they had crossed over to the other side they went ashore at Gennesaret.
Matthew,14,35,And when the men of that place recognized Him they sent around into all the surrounding country and brought to Him all who were sick
Matthew,14,36,And begged Him to let them merely touch the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched it were perfectly restored.
Matthew,15,1,THEN FROM Jerusalem came scribes and Pharisees and said
Matthew,15,2,Why do Your disciples transgress and violate the rules handed down by the elders of the past? For they do not practice [ceremonially] washing their hands before they eat.
Matthew,15,3,He replied to them And why also do you transgress and violate the commandment of God for the sake of the rules handed down to you by your forefathers (the elders)?
Matthew,15,4,For God commanded Honor your father and your mother and He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother let him surely come to his end by death.
Matthew,15,5,But you say If anyone tells his father or mother What you would have gained from me [that is the money and whatever I have that might be used for helping you] is already dedicated as a gift to God then he is exempt and no longer under obligation to honor and help his father or his mother.
Matthew,15,6,So for the sake of your tradition (the rules handed down by your forefathers) you have set aside the Word of God [depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect].
Matthew,15,7,You pretenders (hypocrites)! Admirably and truly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said:
Matthew,15,8,These people draw near Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips but their hearts hold off and are far away from Me.
Matthew,15,9,Uselessly do they worship Me for they teach as doctrines the commands of men.
Matthew,15,10,And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them Listen and grasp and comprehend this:
Matthew,15,11,It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean and defiled but what comes out of the mouth; this makes a man unclean and defiles [him].
Matthew,15,12,Then the disciples came and said to Him Do You know that the Pharisees were displeased and offended and indignant when they heard this saying?
Matthew,15,13,He answered Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by the roots.
Matthew,15,14,Let them alone and disregard them; they are blind guides and teachers. And if a blind man leads a blind man both will fall into a ditch.
Matthew,15,15,But Peter said to Him Explain this proverb (this maxim) to us.
Matthew,15,16,And He said Are you also even yet dull and ignorant [without understanding and unable to put things together]?
Matthew,15,17,Do you not see and understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the abdomen and so passes on into the place where discharges are deposited?
Matthew,15,18,But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart and this is what makes a man unclean and defiles [him].
Matthew,15,19,For out of the heart come evil thoughts (reasonings and disputings and designs) such as murder adultery sexual vice theft false witnessing slander and irreverent speech.
Matthew,15,20,These are what make a man unclean and defile [him]; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean or defile [him].
Matthew,15,21,And going away from there Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew,15,22,And behold a woman who was a Canaanite from that district came out and with a [loud troublesomely urgent] cry begged Have mercy on me O Lord Son of David! My daughter is miserably and distressingly and cruelly possessed by a demon!
Matthew,15,23,But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him saying Send her away for she is crying out after us.
Matthew,15,24,He answered I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew,15,25,But she came and kneeling worshiped Him and kept praying Lord help me!
Matthew,15,26,And He answered It is not right (proper becoming or fair) to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs.
Matthew,15,27,She said Yes Lord yet even the little pups ( little whelps) eat the crumbs that fall from their [young] masters' table.
Matthew,15,28,Then Jesus answered her O woman great is your faith! Be it done for you as you wish. And her daughter was cured from that moment.
Matthew,15,29,And Jesus went on from there and passed along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up into the hills and kept sitting there.
Matthew,15,30,And a great multitude came to Him bringing with them the lame the maimed the blind the dumb and many others and they put them down at His feet; and He cured them
Matthew,15,31,So that the crowd was amazed when they saw the dumb speaking the maimed made whole the lame walking and the blind seeing; and they recognized and praised and thanked and glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew,15,32,Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said I have pity and sympathy and am deeply moved for the crowd because they have been with Me now three days and they have nothing [at all left] to eat; and I am not willing to send them away hungry lest they faint or become exhausted on the way.
Matthew,15,33,And the disciples said to Him Where are we to get bread sufficient to feed so great a crowd in this isolated and desert place?
Matthew,15,34,And Jesus asked them How many loaves of bread do you have? They replied Seven and a few small fish.
Matthew,15,35,And ordering the crowd to recline on the ground
Matthew,15,36,He took the seven loaves and the fish and when He had given thanks He broke them and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people.
Matthew,15,37,And they all ate and were satisfied. And they gathered up seven [ large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
Matthew,15,38,Those who ate were 4000 men not including the women and the children.
Matthew,15,39,Then He dismissed the crowds got into the boat and went to the district of Magadan.
Matthew,16,1,NOW THE Pharisees and Sadducees came up to Jesus and they asked Him to show them a sign (spectacular miracle) from heaven [attesting His divine authority].
Matthew,16,2,He replied to them When it is evening you say It will be fair weather for the sky is red
Matthew,16,3,And in the morning It will be stormy today for the sky is red and has a gloomy and threatening look. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
Matthew,16,4,A wicked and morally unfaithful generation craves a sign but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Then He left them and went away.
Matthew,16,5,When the disciples reached the other side of the sea they found that they had forgotten to bring any bread.
Matthew,16,6,Jesus said to them Be careful and on your guard against the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew,16,7,And they reasoned among themselves about it saying It is because we did not bring any bread.
Matthew,16,8,But Jesus aware of this asked Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? O you [men how little trust you have in Me how] little faith!
Matthew,16,9,Do you not yet discern (perceive and understand)? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many [ small hand] baskets you gathered?
Matthew,16,10,Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many [ large provision] baskets you took up?
Matthew,16,11,How is it that you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But beware of the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew,16,12,Then they discerned that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew,16,13,Now when Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi He asked His disciples Who do people say that the Son of Man is?
Matthew,16,14,And they answered Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
Matthew,16,15,He said to them But who do you [yourselves] say that I am?
Matthew,16,16,Simon Peter replied You are the Christ the Son of the living God.
Matthew,16,17,Then Jesus answered him Blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) are you Simon Bar-Jonah. For flesh and blood [men] have not revealed this to you but My Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,16,18,And I tell you you are Peter [Greek Petros--a large piece of rock] and on this rock [Greek petra--a huge rock like Gibraltar] I will build My church and the gates of Hades (the powers of the infernal region) shall not overpower it [or be strong to its detriment or hold out against it].
Matthew,16,19,I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind (declare to be improper and unlawful) on earth must be what is already bound in heaven; and whatever you loose (declare lawful) on earth must be what is already loosed in heaven.
Matthew,16,20,Then He sternly and strictly charged and warned the disciples to tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
Matthew,16,21,From that time forth Jesus began [clearly] to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and the high priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised from death.
Matthew,16,22,Then Peter took Him aside to speak to Him privately and began to reprove and charge Him sharply saying God forbid Lord! This must never happen to You!
Matthew,16,23,But Jesus turned away from Peter and said to him Get behind Me Satan! You are in My way [an offense and a hindrance and a snare to Me]; for you are minding what partakes not of the nature and quality of God but of men.
Matthew,16,24,Then Jesus said to His disciples If anyone desires to be My disciple let him deny himself [disregard lose sight of and forget himself and his own interests] and take up his cross and follow Me [ cleave steadfastly to Me conform wholly to My example in living and if need be in dying also].
Matthew,16,25,For whoever is bent on saving his [temporal] life [his comfort and security here] shall lose it [eternal life]; and whoever loses his life [his comfort and security here] for My sake shall find it [life everlasting].
Matthew,16,26,For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life [his blessed life in the kingdom of God]? Or what would a man give as an exchange for his [blessed] life [in the kingdom of God]?
Matthew,16,27,For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory (majesty splendor) of His Father with His angels and then He will render account and reward every man in accordance with what he has done.
Matthew,16,28,Truly I tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in (into) His kingdom.
Matthew,17,1,AND SIX days after this Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother and led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
Matthew,17,2,And His appearance underwent a change in their presence; and His face shone clear and bright like the sun and His clothing became as white as light.
Matthew,17,3,And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elijah who kept talking with Him.
Matthew,17,4,Then Peter began to speak and said to Jesus Lord it is good and delightful that we are here; if You approve I will put up three booths here--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
Matthew,17,5,While he was still speaking behold a shining cloud [ composed of light] overshadowed them and a voice from the cloud said This is My Son My Beloved with Whom I am [and have always been] delighted. Listen to Him!
Matthew,17,6,When the disciples heard it they fell on their faces and were seized with alarm and struck with fear.
Matthew,17,7,But Jesus came and touched them and said Get up and do not be afraid.
Matthew,17,8,And when they raised their eyes they saw no one but Jesus only.
Matthew,17,9,And as they were going down the mountain Jesus cautioned and commanded them Do not mention to anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.
Matthew,17,10,The disciples asked Him Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Matthew,17,11,He replied Elijah does come and will get everything restored and ready.
Matthew,17,12,But I tell you that Elijah has come already and they did not know or recognize him but did to him as they liked. So also the Son of Man is going to be treated and suffer at their hands.
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist.
Matthew,17,14,And when they approached the multitude a man came up to Him kneeling before Him and saying
Matthew,17,15,Lord do pity and have mercy on my son for he has epilepsy (is moonstruck) and he suffers terribly; for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the water.
Matthew,17,16,And I brought him to Your disciples and they were not able to cure him.
Matthew,17,17,And Jesus answered O you unbelieving ( warped wayward rebellious) and thoroughly perverse generation! How long am I to remain with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to Me.
Matthew,17,18,And Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was cured instantly.
Matthew,17,19,Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked privately Why could we not drive it out?
Matthew,17,20,He said to them Because of the littleness of your faith [that is your lack of firmly relying trust]. For truly I say to you if you have faith [ that is living] like a grain of mustard seed you can say to this mountain Move from here to yonder place and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.
Matthew,17,21,But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
Matthew,17,22,When they were going about here and there in Galilee Jesus said to them The Son of Man is going to be turned over into the hands of men.
Matthew,17,23,And they will kill Him and He will be raised [to life] again on the third day. And they were deeply and exceedingly grieved and distressed.
Matthew,17,24,When they arrived in Capernaum the collectors of the half shekel [the temple tax] went up to Peter and said Does not your Teacher pay the half shekel?
Matthew,17,25,He answered Yes. And when he came home Jesus spoke to him [about it] first saying What do you think Simon? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties or tribute--from their own sons or from others not of their own family?
Matthew,17,26,And when Peter said From other people not of their own family Jesus said to him Then the sons are exempt.
Matthew,17,27,However in order not to give offense and cause them to stumble [that is to cause them to judge unfavorably and unjustly] go down to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find there a shekel. Take it and give it to them to pay the temple tax for Me and for yourself.
Matthew,18,1,AT THAT time the disciples came up and asked Jesus Who then is [really] the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew,18,2,And He called a little child to Himself and put him in the midst of them
Matthew,18,3,And said Truly I say to you unless you repent (change turn about) and become like little children [trusting lowly loving forgiving] you can never enter the kingdom of heaven [at all].
Matthew,18,4,Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [trusting lowly loving forgiving] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,18,5,And whoever receives and accepts and welcomes one little child like this for My sake and in My name receives and accepts and welcomes Me.
Matthew,18,6,But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [that is who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought] it would be better ( more expedient and profitable or advantageous) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea.
Matthew,18,7,Woe to the world for such temptations to sin and influences to do wrong! It is necessary that temptations come but woe to the person on whose account or by whom the temptation comes!
Matthew,18,8,And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble and sin cut it off and throw it away from you; it is better (more profitable and wholesome) for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire.
Matthew,18,9,And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin pluck it out and throw it away from you; it is better (more profitable and wholesome) for you to enter life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell (Gehenna) of fire.
Matthew,18,10,Beware that you do not despise or feel scornful toward or think little of one of these little ones for I tell you that in heaven their angels always are in the presence of and look upon the face of My Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,18,11,For the Son of man came to save [ from the penalty of eternal death] that which was lost.
Matthew,18,12,What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray and gets lost will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost?
Matthew,18,13,And if it should be that he finds it truly I say to you he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost.
Matthew,18,14,Just so it is not the will of My Father Who is in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost and perish.
Matthew,18,15,If your brother wrongs you go and show him his fault between you and him privately. If he listens to you you have won back your brother.
Matthew,18,16,But if he does not listen take along with you one or two others so that every word may be confirmed and upheld by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Matthew,18,17,If he pays no attention to them [refusing to listen and obey] tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
Matthew,18,18,Truly I tell you whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is already forbidden in heaven and whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be what is already permitted in heaven.
Matthew,18,19,Again I tell you if two of you on earth agree (harmonize together make a symphony together) about whatever [anything and everything] they may ask it will come to pass and be done for them by My Father in heaven.
Matthew,18,20,For wherever two or three are gathered (drawn together as My followers) in (into) My name there I AM in the midst of them.
Matthew,18,21,Then Peter came up to Him and said Lord how many times may my brother sin against me and I forgive him and let it go? [As many as] up to seven times?
Matthew,18,22,Jesus answered him I tell you not up to seven times but seventy times seven!
Matthew,18,23,Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a human king who wished to settle accounts with his attendants.
Matthew,18,24,When he began the accounting one was brought to him who owed him 10000 talents [probably about $10000000]
Matthew,18,25,And because he could not pay his master ordered him to be sold with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed and payment to be made.
Matthew,18,26,So the attendant fell on his knees begging him Have patience with me and I will pay you everything.
Matthew,18,27,And his master's heart was moved with compassion and he released him and forgave him [cancelling] the debt.
Matthew,18,28,But that same attendant as he went out found one of his fellow attendants who owed him a hundred denarii [about twenty dollars]; and he caught him by the throat and said Pay what you owe!
Matthew,18,29,So his fellow attendant fell down and begged him earnestly Give me time and I will pay you all!
Matthew,18,30,But he was unwilling and he went out and had him put in prison till he should pay the debt.
Matthew,18,31,When his fellow attendants saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and told everything that had taken place to their master.
Matthew,18,32,Then his master called him and said to him You contemptible and wicked attendant! I forgave and cancelled all that [great] debt of yours because you begged me to.
Matthew,18,33,And should you not have had pity and mercy on your fellow attendant as I had pity and mercy on you?
Matthew,18,34,And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers (the jailers) till he should pay all that he owed.
Matthew,18,35,So also My heavenly Father will deal with every one of you if you do not freely forgive your brother from your heart his offenses.
Matthew,19,1,NOW WHEN Jesus had finished saying these things He left Galilee and went into the part of Judea that is beyond the Jordan;
Matthew,19,2,And great throngs accompanied Him and He cured them there.
Matthew,19,3,And Pharisees came to Him and put Him to the test by asking Is it lawful and right to dismiss and repudiate and divorce one's wife for any and every cause?
Matthew,19,4,He replied Have you never read that He Who made them from the beginning made them male and female
Matthew,19,5,And said For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly (joined inseparably) to his wife and the two shall become one flesh?
Matthew,19,6,So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let not man put asunder (separate).
Matthew,19,7,They said to Him Why then did Moses command [us] to give a certificate of divorce and thus to dismiss and repudiate a wife?
Matthew,19,8,He said to them Because of the hardness (stubbornness and perversity) of your hearts Moses permitted you to dismiss and repudiate and divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been so [ordained].
Matthew,19,9,I say to you: whoever dismisses (repudiates divorces) his wife except for unchastity and marries another commits adultery and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Matthew,19,10,The disciples said to Him If the case of a man with his wife is like this it is neither profitable nor advisable to marry.
Matthew,19,11,But He said to them Not all men can accept this saying but it is for those to whom [the capacity to receive] it has been given.
Matthew,19,12,For there are eunuchs who have been born incapable of marriage; and there are eunuchs who have been made so by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to accept this accept it.
Matthew,19,13,Then little children were brought to Jesus that He might put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
Matthew,19,14,But He said Leave the children alone! Allow the little ones to come to Me and do not forbid or restrain or hinder them for of such [as these] is the kingdom of heaven composed.
Matthew,19,15,And He put His hands upon them and then went on His way.
Matthew,19,16,And behold there came a man up to Him saying Teacher what excellent and perfectly and essentially good deed must I do to possess eternal life?
Matthew,19,17,And He said to him Why do you ask Me about the perfectly and essentially good? There is only One Who is good [perfectly and essentially]--God. If you would enter into the Life you must continually keep the commandments.
Matthew,19,18,He said to Him What sort of commandments? [Or which ones?] And Jesus answered You shall not kill You shall not commit adultery You shall not steal You shall not bear false witness
Matthew,19,19,Honor your father and your mother and You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.
Matthew,19,20,The young man said I have observed all these from my youth; what still do I lack?
Matthew,19,21,Jesus answered him If you would be perfect [that is have that spiritual maturity which accompanies self-sacrificing character] go and sell what you have and give to the poor and you will have riches in heaven; and come be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me].
Matthew,19,22,But when the young man heard this he went away sad (grieved and in much distress) for he had great possessions.
Matthew,19,23,And Jesus said to His disciples Truly I say to you it will be difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,19,24,Again I tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew,19,25,When the disciples heard this they were utterly puzzled (astonished bewildered) saying Who then can be saved [ from eternal death]?
Matthew,19,26,But Jesus looked at them and said With men this is impossible but all things are possible with God.
Matthew,19,27,Then Peter answered Him saying Behold we have left [our] all and have become Your disciples [sided with Your party and followed You]. What then shall we receive?
Matthew,19,28,Jesus said to them Truly I say to you in the new age [the Messianic rebirth of the world] when the Son of Man shall sit down on the throne of His glory you who have [become My disciples sided with My party and] followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew,19,29,And anyone and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name's sake will receive many [even a hundred] times more and will inherit eternal life.
Matthew,19,30,But many who [now] are first will be last [then] and many who [now] are last will be first [then].
Matthew,20,1,FOR THE kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning along with the dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard.
Matthew,20,2,After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew,20,3,And going out about the third hour (nine o'clock) he saw others standing idle in the marketplace;
Matthew,20,4,And he said to them You go also into the vineyard and whatever is right I will pay you. And they went.
Matthew,20,5,He went out again about the sixth hour (noon) and the ninth hour (three o'clock) he did the same.
Matthew,20,6,And about the eleventh hour (five o'clock) he went out and found still others standing around and said to them Why do you stand here idle all day?
Matthew,20,7,They answered him Because nobody has hired us. He told them You go out into the vineyard also and you will get whatever is just and fair.
Matthew,20,8,When evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager Call the workmen and pay them their wages beginning with the last and ending with the first.
Matthew,20,9,And those who had been hired at the eleventh hour (five o'clock) came and received a denarius each.
Matthew,20,10,Now when the first came they supposed they would get more but each of them also received a denarius.
Matthew,20,11,And when they received it they grumbled at the owner of the estate
Matthew,20,12,Saying These [men] who came last worked no more than an hour and yet you have made them rank with us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.
Matthew,20,13,But he answered one of them Friend I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
Matthew,20,14,Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this man hired last the same as I give to you.
Matthew,20,15,Am I not permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? [Or do you begrudge my being generous?] Is your eye evil because I am good?
Matthew,20,16,So those who [now] are last will be first [then] and those who [now] are first will be last [then]. For many are called but few chosen.
Matthew,20,17,And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem He took the twelve disciples aside along the way and said to them
Matthew,20,18,Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes; and they will sentence Him to death
Matthew,20,19,And deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and whipped and crucified and He will be raised [to life] on the third day.
Matthew,20,20,Then the mother of Zebedee's children came up to Him with her sons and kneeling worshiped Him and asked a favor of Him.
Matthew,20,21,And He asked her What do you wish? She answered Him Give orders that these two sons of mine may sit one at Your right hand and one at Your left in Your kingdom.
Matthew,20,22,But Jesus replied You do not realize what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? They answered We are able.
Matthew,20,23,He said to them You will drink My cup but seats at My right hand and at My left are not Mine to give but they are for those for whom they have been ordained and prepared by My Father.
Matthew,20,24,But when the ten [other disciples] heard this they were indignant at the two brothers.
Matthew,20,25,And Jesus called them to Him and said You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great men hold them in subjection [tyrannizing over them].
Matthew,20,26,Not so shall it be among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant
Matthew,20,27,And whoever desires to be first among you must be your slave--
Matthew,20,28,Just as the Son of Man came not to be waited on but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many [the price paid to set them free].
Matthew,20,29,And as they were going out of Jericho a great throng accompanied Him.
Matthew,20,30,And behold two blind men were sitting by the roadside and when they heard that Jesus was passing by they cried out Lord have pity and mercy on us [You] Son of David!
Matthew,20,31,The crowds reproved them and told them to keep still; but they cried out all the more Lord have pity and mercy on us [You] Son of David!
Matthew,20,32,And Jesus stopped and called them and asked What do you want Me to do for you?
Matthew,20,33,They answered Him Lord we want our eyes to be opened!
Matthew,20,34,And Jesus in pity touched their eyes; and instantly they received their sight and followed Him.
Matthew,21,1,AND WHEN they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage at the Mount of Olives Jesus sent two disciples on ahead
Matthew,21,2,Saying to them Go into the village that is opposite you and at once you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie [them] and bring [them] to Me.
Matthew,21,3,If anyone says anything to you you shall reply The Lord needs them and he will let them go without delay.
Matthew,21,4,This happened that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled saying
Matthew,21,5,Say to the Daughter of Zion [inhabitants of Jerusalem] Behold your King is coming to you lowly and riding on a donkey and on a colt the foal of a donkey [a beast of burden].
Matthew,21,6,Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
Matthew,21,7,They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their coats upon them and He seated Himself on them [the clothing].
Matthew,21,8,And most of the crowd kept spreading their garments on the road and others kept cutting branches from the trees and scattering them on the road.
Matthew,21,9,And the crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed Him kept shouting Hosanna ( O be propitious graciously inclined) to the Son of David [ the Messiah]! Blessed (praised glorified) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna (O be favorably disposed) in the highest [heaven]!
Matthew,21,10,And when He entered Jerusalem all the city became agitated and [trembling with excitement] said Who is This?
Matthew,21,11,And the crowds replied This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew,21,12,And Jesus went into the temple ( whole temple enclosure) and drove out all who bought and sold in the sacred place and He turned over the four-footed tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who sold doves.
Matthew,21,13,He said to them The Scripture says My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.
Matthew,21,14,And the blind and the lame came to Him in the porches and courts of the temple and He cured them.
Matthew,21,15,But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He did and the boys and the girls and the youths and the maidens crying out in the porches and courts of the temple Hosanna (O be propitious graciously inclined) to the Son of David! they were indignant.
Matthew,21,16,And they said to Him Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus replied to them Yes; have you never read Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have made (provided) perfect praise?
Matthew,21,17,And leaving them He departed from the city and went out to Bethany and lodged there.
Matthew,21,18,In the early dawn the next morning as He was coming back to the city He was hungry.
Matthew,21,19,And as He saw one single leafy fig tree above the roadside He went to it but He found nothing but leaves on it [ seeing that in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves]. And He said to it Never again shall fruit grow on you! And the fig tree withered up at once.
Matthew,21,20,When the disciples saw it they marveled greatly and asked How is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once?
Matthew,21,21,And Jesus answered them Truly I say to you if you have faith (a firm relying trust) and do not doubt you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain Be taken up and cast into the sea it will be done.
Matthew,21,22,And whatever you ask for in prayer having faith and [really] believing you will receive.
Matthew,21,23,And when He entered the sacred enclosure of the temple the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him as He was teaching and said By what power of authority are You doing these things and who gave You this power of authority?
Matthew,21,24,Jesus answered them I also will ask you a question and if you give Me the answer then I also will tell you by what power of authority I do these things.
Matthew,21,25,The baptism of John--from where was it? From heaven or from men? And they reasoned and argued with one another If we say From heaven He will ask us Why then did you not believe him?
Matthew,21,26,But if we say From men--we are afraid of and must reckon with the multitude for they all regard John as a prophet.
Matthew,21,27,So they answered Jesus We do not know. And He said to them Neither will I tell you by what power of authority I do these things.
Matthew,21,28,What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He came to the first and said Son go and work today in the vineyard.
Matthew,21,29,And he answered I will not; but afterward he changed his mind and went.
Matthew,21,30,Then the man came to the second and said the same [thing]. And he replied I will [go] sir; but he did not go.
Matthew,21,31,Which of the two did the will of the father? They replied The first one. Jesus said to them Truly I tell you the tax collectors and the harlots will get into the kingdom of heaven before you.
Matthew,21,32,For John came to you walking in the way of an upright man in right standing with God and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the harlots did believe him; and you even when you saw that did not afterward change your minds and believe him [adhere to trust in and rely on what he told you].
Matthew,21,33,Listen to another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine vat in it and built a watchtower. Then he let it out [for rent] to tenants and went into another country.
Matthew,21,34,When the fruit season drew near he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [share of the] fruit.
Matthew,21,35,But the tenants took his servants and beat one killed another and stoned another.
Matthew,21,36,Again he sent other servants more than the first time and they treated them the same way.
Matthew,21,37,Finally he sent his own son to them saying They will respect and give heed to my son.
Matthew,21,38,But when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves This is the heir; come on let us kill him and have his inheritance.
Matthew,21,39,And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Matthew,21,40,Now when the owner of the vineyard comes back what will he do to those tenants?
Matthew,21,41,They said to Him He will put those wretches to a miserable death and rent the vineyard to other tenants of such a character that they will give him the fruits promptly in their season.
Matthew,21,42,Jesus asked them Have you never read in the Scriptures: The very Stone which the builders rejected and threw away has become the Cornerstone; this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes?
Matthew,21,43,I tell you for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce the fruits of it.
Matthew,21,44,And whoever falls on this Stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom It falls will be crushed to powder [and It will winnow him scattering him like dust].
Matthew,21,45,And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables (comparisons stories used to illustrate and explain) they perceived that He was talking about them.
Matthew,21,46,And although they were trying to arrest Him they feared the throngs because they regarded Him as a prophet.
Matthew,22,1,AND AGAIN Jesus spoke to them in parables (comparisons stories used to illustrate and explain) saying
Matthew,22,2,The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son
Matthew,22,3,And sent his servants to summon those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they refused to come.
Matthew,22,4,Again he sent other servants saying Tell those who are invited Behold I have prepared my banquet; my bullocks and my fat calves are killed and everything is prepared; come to the wedding feast.
Matthew,22,5,But they were not concerned and paid no attention [they ignored and made light of the summons treating it with contempt] and they went away--one to his farm another to his business
Matthew,22,6,While the others seized his servants treated them shamefully and put them to death.
Matthew,22,7,[Hearing this] the king was infuriated; and he sent his soldiers and put those murderers to death and burned their city.
Matthew,22,8,Then he said to his servants The wedding [feast] is prepared but those invited were not worthy.
Matthew,22,9,So go to the thoroughfares where they leave the city [where the main roads and those from the country end] and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.
Matthew,22,10,And those servants went out on the crossroads and got together as many as they found both bad and good so [the room in which] the wedding feast [was held] was filled with guests.
Matthew,22,11,But when the king came in to view the guests he looked intently at a man there who had on no wedding garment.
Matthew,22,12,And he said Friend how did you come in here without putting on the [appropriate] wedding garment? And he was speechless ( muzzled gagged).
Matthew,22,13,Then the king said to the attendants Tie him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,22,14,For many are called (invited and summoned) but few are chosen.
Matthew,22,15,Then the Pharisees went and consulted and plotted together how they might entangle Jesus in His talk.
Matthew,22,16,And they sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians saying Teacher we know that You are sincere and what You profess to be and that You teach the way of God truthfully regardless of consequences and being afraid of no man; for You are impartial and do not regard either the person or the position of anyone.
Matthew,22,17,Tell us then what You think about this: Is it lawful to pay tribute [levied on individuals and to be paid yearly] to Caesar or not?
Matthew,22,18,But Jesus aware of their malicious plot asked Why do you put Me to the test and try to entrap Me you pretenders (hypocrites)?
Matthew,22,19,Show me the money used for the tribute. And they brought Him a denarius.
Matthew,22,20,And Jesus said to them Whose likeness and title are these?
Matthew,22,21,They said Caesar's. Then He said to them Pay therefore to Caesar the things that are due to Caesar and pay to God the things that are due to God.
Matthew,22,22,When they heard it they were amazed and marveled; and they left Him and departed.
Matthew,22,23,The same day some Sadducees who say that there is no resurrection [of the dead] came to Him and they asked Him a question
Matthew,22,24,Saying Teacher Moses said If a man dies leaving no children his brother shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.
Matthew,22,25,Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married and died and having no children left his wife to his brother.
Matthew,22,26,The second also died childless and the third down to the seventh.
Matthew,22,27,Last of all the woman died also.
Matthew,22,28,Now in the resurrection to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.
Matthew,22,29,But Jesus replied to them You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor God's power.
Matthew,22,30,For in the resurrected state neither do [men] marry nor are [women] given in marriage but they are like the angels in heaven.
Matthew,22,31,But as to the resurrection of the dead--have you never read what was said to you by God
Matthew,22,32,I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living!
Matthew,22,33,And when the throng heard it they were astonished and filled with [ glad] amazement at His teaching.
Matthew,22,34,Now when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced ( muzzled) the Sadducees they gathered together.
Matthew,22,35,And one of their number a lawyer asked Him a question to test Him.
Matthew,22,36,Teacher which kind of commandment is great and important (the principal kind) in the Law? [Some commandments are light--which are heavy?]
Matthew,22,37,And He replied to him You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind (intellect).
Matthew,22,38,This is the great (most important principal) and first commandment.
Matthew,22,39,And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.
Matthew,22,40,These two commandments sum up and upon them depend all the Law and the Prophets.
Matthew,22,41,Now while the Pharisees were still assembled there Jesus asked them a question
Matthew,22,42,Saying What do you think of the Christ? Whose Son is He? They said to Him The Son of David.
Matthew,22,43,He said to them How is it then that David under the influence of the [Holy] Spirit calls Him Lord saying
Matthew,22,44,The Lord said to My Lord Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet?
Matthew,22,45,If then David thus calls Him Lord how is He his Son?
Matthew,22,46,And no one was able to answer Him a word nor from that day did anyone venture or dare to question Him.
Matthew,23,1,THEN JESUS said to the multitudes and to His disciples
Matthew,23,2,The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat [of authority].
Matthew,23,3,So observe and practice all they tell you; but do not do what they do for they preach but do not practice.
Matthew,23,4,They tie up heavy loads hard to bear and place them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not lift a finger to help bear them.
Matthew,23,5,They do all their works to be seen of men; for they make wide their phylacteries ( small cases enclosing certain Scripture passages worn during prayer on the left arm and forehead) and make long their fringes [worn by all male Israelites according to the command].
Matthew,23,6,And they take pleasure in and [thus] love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues
Matthew,23,7,And to be greeted with honor in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi.
Matthew,23,8,But you are not to be called rabbi (teacher) for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers.
Matthew,23,9,And do not call anyone [in the church] on earth father for you have one Father Who is in heaven.
Matthew,23,10,And you must not be called masters (leaders) for you have one Master (Leader) the Christ.
Matthew,23,11,He who is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew,23,12,Whoever exalts himself [ with haughtiness and empty pride] shall be humbled (brought low) and whoever humbles himself [whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly] shall be raised to honor.
Matthew,23,13,But woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor do you allow those who are about to go in to do so.
Matthew,23,14,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you swallow up widows' houses and for a pretense to cover it up make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation and the heavier sentence.
Matthew,23,15,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte and when he becomes one [a proselyte] you make him doubly as much a child of hell (Gehenna) as you are.
Matthew,23,16,Woe to you blind guides who say If anyone swears by the sanctuary of the temple it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the sanctuary he is a debtor [bound by his oath].
Matthew,23,17,You blind fools! For which is greater: the gold or the sanctuary of the temple that has made the gold sacred?
Matthew,23,18,You say too Whoever swears by the altar is not duty bound; but whoever swears by the offering on the altar his oath is binding.
Matthew,23,19,You blind men! Which is greater: the gift or the altar which makes the gift sacred?
Matthew,23,20,So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
Matthew,23,21,And he who swears by the sanctuary of the temple swears by it and by Him Who dwells in it. [I Kings 8:13; Ps. 26:8.]
Matthew,23,22,And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits upon it.
Matthew,23,23,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you give a tenth of your mint and dill and cummin and have neglected and omitted the weightier (more important) matters of the Law--right and justice and mercy and fidelity. These you ought [particularly] to have done without neglecting the others.
Matthew,23,24,You blind guides filtering out a gnat and gulping down a camel!
Matthew,23,25,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but within they are full of extortion (prey spoil plunder) and grasping self-indulgence.
Matthew,23,26,You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and of the plate so that the outside may be clean also.
Matthew,23,27,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you are like tombs that have been whitewashed which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men's bones and everything impure.
Matthew,23,28,Just so you also outwardly seem to people to be just and upright but inside you are full of pretense and lawlessness and iniquity.
Matthew,23,29,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees pretenders (hypocrites)! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous
Matthew,23,30,Saying If we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have aided them in shedding the blood of the prophets.
Matthew,23,31,Thus you are testifying against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
Matthew,23,32,Fill up then the measure of your fathers' sins to the brim [so that nothing may be wanting to a full measure].
Matthew,23,33,You serpents! You spawn of vipers! How can you escape the penalty to be suffered in hell (Gehenna)?
Matthew,23,34,Because of this take notice: I am sending you prophets and wise men (interpreters and teachers) and scribes (men learned in the Mosaic Law and the Prophets); some of them you will kill even crucify and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue and persecute from town to town
Matthew,23,35,So that upon your heads may come all the blood of the righteous ( those who correspond to the divine standard of right) shed on earth from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar [of burnt offering].
Matthew,23,36,Truly I declare to you all these [ evil calamitous times] will come upon this generation. [II Chron. 36:15 16.]
Matthew,23,37,O Jerusalem Jerusalem murdering the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a mother fowl gathers her brood under her wings and you refused!
Matthew,23,38,Behold your house is forsaken and desolate (abandoned and left destitute of God's help). [I Kings 9:7; Jer. 22:5.]
Matthew,23,39,For I declare to you you will not see Me again until you say Blessed (magnified in worship adored and exalted) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord!
Matthew,24,1,JESUS DEPARTED from the temple area and was going on His way when His disciples came up to Him to call His attention to the buildings of the temple and point them out to Him.
Matthew,24,2,But He answered them Do you see all these? Truly I tell you there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.
Matthew,24,3,While He was seated on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to Him privately and said Tell us when will this take place and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end (the completion the consummation) of the age?
Matthew,24,4,Jesus answered them Be careful that no one misleads you [deceiving you and leading you into error].
Matthew,24,5,For many will come in (on the strength of) My name [ appropriating the name which belongs to Me] saying I am the Christ (the Messiah) and they will lead many astray.
Matthew,24,6,And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not frightened or troubled for this must take place but the end is not yet.
Matthew,24,7,For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place;
Matthew,24,8,All this is but the beginning [the early pains] of the birth pangs [of the intolerable anguish].
Matthew,24,9,Then they will hand you over to suffer affliction and tribulation and put you to death and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake.
Matthew,24,10,And then many will be offended and repelled and will begin to distrust and desert [Him Whom they ought to trust and obey] and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred.
Matthew,24,11,And many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error.
Matthew,24,12,And the love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity
Matthew,24,13,But he who endures to the end will be saved.
Matthew,24,14,And this good news of the kingdom (the Gospel) will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations and then will come the end.
Matthew,24,15,So when you see the appalling sacrilege [the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate] spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the Holy Place--let the reader take notice and ponder and consider and heed [this]--
Matthew,24,16,Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;
Matthew,24,17,Let him who is on the housetop not come down and go into the house to take anything;
Matthew,24,18,And let him who is in the field not turn back to get his overcoat.
Matthew,24,19,And alas for the women who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days!
Matthew,24,20,Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
Matthew,24,21,For then there will be great tribulation (affliction distress and oppression) such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now--no and never will be [again].
Matthew,24,22,And if those days had not been shortened no human being would endure and survive but for the sake of the elect (God's chosen ones) those days will be shortened.
Matthew,24,23,If anyone says to you then Behold here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or There He is!--do not believe it.
Matthew,24,24,For false Christs and false prophets will arise and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive and lead astray if possible even the elect (God's chosen ones).
Matthew,24,25,See I have warned you beforehand.
Matthew,24,26,So if they say to you Behold He is in the wilderness (desert)--do not go out there; if they tell you Behold He is in the secret places or inner rooms--do not believe it.
Matthew,24,27,For just as the lightning flashes from the east and shines and is seen as far as the west so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew,24,28,Wherever there is a fallen body (a corpse) there the vultures (or eagles) will flock together.
Matthew,24,29,Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed its light and the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Matthew,24,30,Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and beat their breasts and lament in anguish and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory [in brilliancy and splendor].
Matthew,24,31,And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather His elect (His chosen ones) from the four winds [even] from one end of the universe to the other.
Matthew,24,32,From the fig tree learn this lesson: as soon as its young shoots become soft and tender and it puts out its leaves you know of a surety that summer is near.
Matthew,24,33,So also when you see these signs all taken together coming to pass you may know of a surety that He is near at the very doors.
Matthew,24,34,Truly I tell you this generation ( the whole multitude of people living at the same time in a definite given period) will not pass away till all these things taken together take place.
Matthew,24,35,Sky and earth will pass away but My words will not pass away.
Matthew,24,36,But of that [exact] day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the Son but only the Father.
Matthew,24,37,As were the days of Noah so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Matthew,24,38,For just as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking [men] marrying and [women] being given in marriage until the [very] day when Noah went into the ark
Matthew,24,39,And they did not know or understand until the flood came and swept them all away--so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Matthew,24,40,At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew,24,41,Two women will be grinding at the hand mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew,24,42,Watch therefore [ give strict attention be cautious and active] for you do not know in what kind of a day [ whether a near or remote one] your Lord is coming.
Matthew,24,43,But understand this: had the householder known in what [part of the night whether in a night or a morning] watch the thief was coming he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be undermined and broken into.
Matthew,24,44,You also must be ready therefore for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him.
Matthew,24,45,Who then is the faithful thoughtful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give to the others the food and supplies at the proper time?
Matthew,24,46,Blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) is that servant whom when his master comes he will find so doing.
Matthew,24,47,I solemnly declare to you he will set him over all his possessions.
Matthew,24,48,But if that servant is wicked and says to himself My master is delayed and is going to be gone a long time
Matthew,24,49,And begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken
Matthew,24,50,The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he is not aware
Matthew,24,51,And will punish him [ cut him up by scourging] and put him with the pretenders (hypocrites); there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,25,1,THEN THE kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew,25,2,Five of them were foolish (thoughtless without forethought) and five were wise (sensible intelligent and prudent).
Matthew,25,3,For when the foolish took their lamps they did not take any [extra] oil with them;
Matthew,25,4,But the wise took flasks of oil along with them [also] with their lamps.
Matthew,25,5,While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming they all began nodding their heads and they fell asleep.
Matthew,25,6,But at midnight there was a shout Behold the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!
Matthew,25,7,Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order.
Matthew,25,8,And the foolish said to the wise Give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out.
Matthew,25,9,But the wise replied There will not be enough for us and for you; go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves.
Matthew,25,10,But while they were going away to buy the bridegroom came and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.
Matthew,25,11,Later the other virgins also came and said Lord Lord open [the door] to us!
Matthew,25,12,But He replied I solemnly declare to you I do not know you [I am not acquainted with you].
Matthew,25,13,Watch therefore [give strict attention and be cautious and active] for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come.
Matthew,25,14,For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property.
Matthew,25,15,To one he gave five talents [probably about $5000] to another two to another one--to each in proportion to his own personal ability. Then he departed and left the country.
Matthew,25,16,He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them and he gained five talents more.
Matthew,25,17,And likewise he who had received the two talents--he also gained two talents more.
Matthew,25,18,But he who had received the one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.
Matthew,25,19,Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
Matthew,25,20,And he who had received the five talents came and brought him five more saying Master you entrusted to me five talents; see here I have gained five talents more.
Matthew,25,21,His master said to him Well done you upright (honorable admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight the blessedness) which your master enjoys.
Matthew,25,22,And he also who had the two talents came forward saying Master you entrusted two talents to me; here I have gained two talents more.
Matthew,25,23,His master said to him Well done you upright (honorable admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight the blessedness) which your master enjoys.
Matthew,25,24,He who had received one talent also came forward saying Master I knew you to be a harsh and hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you had not winnowed [the grain].
Matthew,25,25,So I was afraid and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is your own.
Matthew,25,26,But his master answered him You wicked and lazy and idle servant! Did you indeed know that I reap where I have not sowed and gather [grain] where I have not winnowed?
Matthew,25,27,Then you should have invested my money with the bankers and at my coming I would have received what was my own with interest.
Matthew,25,28,So take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
Matthew,25,29,For to everyone who has will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have even what he does have will be taken away.
Matthew,25,30,And throw the good-for-nothing servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
Matthew,25,31,When the Son of Man comes in His glory (His majesty and splendor) and all the holy angels with Him then He will sit on the throne of His glory.
Matthew,25,32,All nations will be gathered before Him and He will separate them [the people] from one another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats;
Matthew,25,33,And He will cause the sheep to stand at His right hand but the goats at His left.
Matthew,25,34,Then the King will say to those at His right hand Come you blessed of My Father [you favored of God and appointed to eternal salvation] inherit (receive as your own) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Matthew,25,35,For I was hungry and you gave Me food I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink I was a stranger and you brought Me together with yourselves and welcomed and entertained and lodged Me
Matthew,25,36,I was naked and you clothed Me I was sick and you visited Me with help and ministering care I was in prison and you came to see Me.
Matthew,25,37,Then the just and upright will answer Him Lord when did we see You hungry and gave You food or thirsty and gave You something to drink?
Matthew,25,38,And when did we see You a stranger and welcomed and entertained You or naked and clothed You?
Matthew,25,39,And when did we see You sick or in prison and came to visit You?
Matthew,25,40,And the King will reply to them Truly I tell you in so far as you did it for one of the least [ in the estimation of men] of these My brethren you did it for Me.
Matthew,25,41,Then He will say to those at His left hand Begone from Me you cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels!
Matthew,25,42,For I was hungry and you gave Me no food I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink
Matthew,25,43,I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me and entertain Me I was naked and you did not clothe Me I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me with help and ministering care.
Matthew,25,44,Then they also [in their turn] will answer Lord when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You?
Matthew,25,45,And He will reply to them Solemnly I declare to you in so far as you failed to do it for the least [ in the estimation of men] of these you failed to do it for Me.
Matthew,25,46,Then they will go away into eternal punishment but those who are just and upright and in right standing with God into eternal life.
Matthew,26,1,WHEN JESUS had ended this discourse He said to His disciples
Matthew,26,2,You know that the Passover is in two days--and the Son of Man will be delivered up treacherously to be crucified.
Matthew,26,3,Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the [ open] court of the palace of the high priest whose name was Caiaphas
Matthew,26,4,And consulted together in order to arrest Jesus by stratagem secretly and put Him to death.
Matthew,26,5,But they said It must not be during the Feast for fear that there will be a riot among the people.
Matthew,26,6,Now when Jesus came back to Bethany and was in the house of Simon the leper
Matthew,26,7,A woman came up to Him with an alabaster flask of very precious perfume and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.
Matthew,26,8,And when the disciples saw it they were indignant saying For what purpose is all this waste?
Matthew,26,9,For this perfume might have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor.
Matthew,26,10,But Jesus fully aware of this said to them Why do you bother the woman? She has done a noble (praiseworthy and beautiful) thing to Me.
Matthew,26,11,For you always have the poor among you but you will not always have Me.
Matthew,26,12,In pouring this perfume on My body she has done something to prepare Me for My burial.
Matthew,26,13,Truly I tell you wherever this good news (the Gospel) is preached in the whole world what this woman has done will be told also in memory of her.
Matthew,26,14,Then one of the Twelve [apostles] who was called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests
Matthew,26,15,And said What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you? And they weighed out for and paid to him thirty pieces of silver [about twenty-one dollars and sixty cents].
Matthew,26,16,And from that moment he sought a fitting opportunity to betray Him.
Matthew,26,17,Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread [Passover week] the disciples came to Jesus and said to Him Where do You wish us to prepare for You to eat the Passover supper?
Matthew,26,18,He said Go into the city to a certain man and say to him The Master says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.
Matthew,26,19,And accordingly the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and they made ready the Passover supper.
Matthew,26,20,When it was evening He was reclining at table with the twelve disciples.
Matthew,26,21,And as they were eating He said Solemnly I say to you one of you will betray Me!
Matthew,26,22,They were exceedingly pained and distressed and deeply hurt and sorrowful and began to say to Him one after another Surely it cannot be I Lord can it?
Matthew,26,23,He replied He who has [just] dipped his hand in the same dish with Me will betray Me!
Matthew,26,24,The Son of Man is going just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better (more profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born!
Matthew,26,25,Judas the betrayer said Surely it is not I is it Master? He said to him You have stated [the fact].
Matthew,26,26,Now as they were eating Jesus took bread and praising God gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use and when He had broken it He gave it to the disciples and said Take eat; this is My body.
Matthew,26,27,And He took a cup and when He had given thanks He gave it to them saying Drink of it all of you;
Matthew,26,28,For this is My blood of the new covenant which [ ratifies the agreement and] is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Matthew,26,29,I say to you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new and of superior quality in My Father's kingdom.
Matthew,26,30,And when they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Matthew,26,31,Then Jesus said to them You will all be offended and stumble and fall away because of Me this night [distrusting and deserting Me] for it is written I will strike the Shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.
Matthew,26,32,But after I am raised up [to life again] I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
Matthew,26,33,Peter declared to Him Though they all are offended and stumble and fall away because of You [and distrust and desert You] I will never do so.
Matthew,26,34,Jesus said to him Solemnly I declare to you this very night before a single rooster crows you will deny and disown Me three times.
Matthew,26,35,Peter said to Him Even if I must die with You I will not deny or disown You! And all the disciples said the same thing.
Matthew,26,36,Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and He told His disciples Sit down here while I go over yonder and pray.
Matthew,26,37,And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee He began to show grief and distress of mind and was deeply depressed.
Matthew,26,38,Then He said to them My soul is very sad and deeply grieved so that I am almost dying of sorrow. Stay here and keep awake and keep watch with Me.
Matthew,26,39,And going a little farther He threw Himself upon the ground on His face and prayed saying My Father if it is possible let this cup pass away from Me; nevertheless not what I will [not what I desire] but as You will and desire.
Matthew,26,40,And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping and He said to Peter What! Are you so utterly unable to stay awake and keep watch with Me for one hour?
Matthew,26,41,All of you must keep awake (give strict attention be cautious and active) and watch and pray that you may not come into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.
Matthew,26,42,Again a second time He went away and prayed My Father if this cannot pass by unless I drink it Your will be done.
Matthew,26,43,And again He came and found them sleeping for their eyes were weighed down with sleep.
Matthew,26,44,So leaving them again He went away and prayed for the third time using the same words.
Matthew,26,45,Then He returned to the disciples and said to them Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of especially wicked sinners [ whose way or nature it is to act in opposition to God].
Matthew,26,46,Get up let us be going! See My betrayer is at hand!
Matthew,26,47,As He was still speaking Judas one of the Twelve [apostles] came up and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew,26,48,Now the betrayer had given them a sign saying The One I shall kiss is the Man; seize Him.
Matthew,26,49,And he came up to Jesus at once and said Hail (greetings good health to You long life to You) Master! And he embraced Him and kissed Him with [pretended] warmth and devotion.
Matthew,26,50,Jesus said to him Friend for what are you here? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him.
Matthew,26,51,And behold one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and striking the body servant of the high priest cut off his ear.
Matthew,26,52,Then Jesus said to him Put your sword back into its place for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
Matthew,26,53,Do you suppose that I cannot appeal to My Father and He will immediately provide Me with more than twelve legions [ more than 80000] of angels?
Matthew,26,54,But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must come about this way?
Matthew,26,55,At that moment Jesus said to the crowds Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me? Day after day I was accustomed to sit in the porches and courts of the temple teaching and you did not arrest Me.
Matthew,26,56,But all this has taken place in order that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted Him and fleeing escaped.
Matthew,26,57,But those who had seized Jesus took Him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Matthew,26,58,But Peter followed Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest's home; he even went inside and sat with the guards to see the end.
Matthew,26,59,Now the chief priests and the whole council (the Sanhedrin) sought to get false witnesses to testify against Jesus so that they might put Him to death;
Matthew,26,60,But they found none though many witnesses came forward [to testify]. At last two men came forward
Matthew,26,61,And testified This Fellow said I am able to tear down the sanctuary of the temple of God and to build it up again in three days.
Matthew,26,62,And the high priest stood up and said Have You no answer to make? What about this that these men testify against You?
Matthew,26,63,But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him I call upon you to swear by the living God and tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God.
Matthew,26,64,Jesus said to him You have stated [the fact]. More than that I tell you: You will in the future see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of the sky.
Matthew,26,65,Then the high priest tore his clothes and exclaimed He has uttered blasphemy! What need have we of further evidence? You have now heard His blasphemy.
Matthew,26,66,What do you think now? They answered He deserves to be put to death.
Matthew,26,67,Then they spat in His face and struck Him with their fists; and some slapped Him in the face
Matthew,26,68,Saying Prophesy to us You Christ (the Messiah)! Who was it that struck You?
Matthew,26,69,Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard and one maid came up to him and said You were also with Jesus the Galilean!
Matthew,26,70,But he denied it falsely before them all saying I do not know what you mean.
Matthew,26,71,And when he had gone out to the porch another maid saw him and she said to the bystanders This fellow was with Jesus the Nazarene!
Matthew,26,72,And again he denied it and disowned Him with an oath saying I do not know the Man!
Matthew,26,73,After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter You certainly are one of them too for even your accent betrays you.
Matthew,26,74,Then Peter began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear I do not even know the Man! And at that moment a rooster crowed.
Matthew,26,75,And Peter remembered Jesus' words when He had said Before a single rooster crows you will deny and disown Me three times. And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Matthew,27,1,WHEN IT was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people held a consultation against Jesus to put Him to death;
Matthew,27,2,And they bound Him and led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the governor.
Matthew,27,3,When Judas His betrayer saw that [Jesus] was condemned [Judas was afflicted in mind and troubled for his former folly; and] with remorse [with little more than a selfish dread of the consequences] he brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders
Matthew,27,4,Saying I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. They replied What is that to us? See to that yourself.
Matthew,27,5,And casting the pieces of silver [forward] into the [Holy Place of the sanctuary of the] temple he departed; and he went off and hanged himself.
Matthew,27,6,But the chief priests picking up the pieces of silver said It is not legal to put these in the [consecrated] treasury for it is the price of blood.
Matthew,27,7,So after consultation they bought with them [the pieces of silver] the potter's field [as a place] in which to bury strangers.
Matthew,27,8,Therefore that piece of ground has been called the Field of Blood to the present day.
Matthew,27,9,Then were fulfilled the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet when he said And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of Him on Whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel
Matthew,27,10,And they gave them for the potter's field as the Lord directed me.
Matthew,27,11,Now Jesus stood before the governor [Pilate] and the governor asked Him Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said to him You have stated [the fact].
Matthew,27,12,But when the charges were made against Him by the chief priests and elders He made no answer.
Matthew,27,13,Then Pilate said to Him Do You not hear how many and how serious are the things they are testifying against You?
Matthew,27,14,But He made no reply to him not even to a single accusation so that the governor marveled greatly.
Matthew,27,15,Now at the Feast [of the Passover] the governor was in the habit of setting free for the people any one prisoner whom they chose.
Matthew,27,16,And at that time they had a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas.
Matthew,27,17,So when they had assembled for this purpose Pilate said to them Whom do you want me to set free for you Barabbas or Jesus Who is called Christ?
Matthew,27,18,For he knew that it was because of envy that they had handed Him over to him.
Matthew,27,19,Also while he was seated on the judgment bench his wife sent him a message saying Have nothing to do with that just and upright Man for I have had a painful experience today in a dream because of Him.
Matthew,27,20,But the chief priests and the elders prevailed on the people to ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death.
Matthew,27,21,Again the governor said to them Which of the two do you wish me to release for you? And they said Barabbas!
Matthew,27,22,Pilate said to them Then what shall I do with Jesus Who is called Christ?
Matthew,27,23,They all replied Let Him be crucified! And he said Why? What has He done that is evil? But they shouted all the louder Let Him be crucified!
Matthew,27,24,So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere but rather that a riot was about to break out he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd saying I am not guilty of nor responsible for this righteous Man's blood; see to it yourselves.
Matthew,27,25,And all the people answered Let His blood be on us and on our children!
Matthew,27,26,So he set free for them Barabbas; and he [had] Jesus whipped and delivered Him up to be crucified.
Matthew,27,27,Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace and they gathered the whole battalion about Him.
Matthew,27,28,And they stripped off His clothes and put a scarlet robe ( garment of dignity and office worn by Roman officers of rank) upon Him
Matthew,27,29,And weaving a crown of thorns they put it on His head and put a reed (staff) in His right hand. And kneeling before Him they made sport of Him saying Hail (greetings good health to You long life to You) King of the Jews!
Matthew,27,30,And they spat on Him and took the reed (staff) and struck Him on the head.
Matthew,27,31,And when they finished making sport of Him they stripped Him of the robe and put His own garments on Him and led Him away to be crucified.
Matthew,27,32,As they were marching forth they came upon a man of Cyrene named Simon; this man they forced to carry the cross of Jesus.
Matthew,27,33,And when they came to a place called Golgotha [Latin: Calvary] which means The Place of a Skull
Matthew,27,34,They offered Him wine mingled with gall to drink; but when He tasted it He refused to drink it.
Matthew,27,35,And when they had crucified Him they divided and distributed His garments [among them] by casting lots so that the prophet's saying was fulfilled They parted My garments among them and over My apparel they cast lots.
Matthew,27,36,Then they sat down there and kept watch over Him.
Matthew,27,37,And over His head they put the accusation against Him ( the cause of His death) which read This is Jesus the King of the Jews.
Matthew,27,38,At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him one on the right hand and one on the left.
Matthew,27,39,And those who passed by spoke reproachfully and abusively and jeered at Him wagging their heads
Matthew,27,40,And they said You Who would tear down the sanctuary of the temple and rebuild it in three days rescue Yourself from death. If You are the Son of God come down from the cross.
Matthew,27,41,In the same way the chief priests with the scribes and elders made sport of Him saying
Matthew,27,42,He rescued others from death; Himself He cannot rescue from death. He is the King of Israel? Let Him come down from the cross now and we will believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Him.
Matthew,27,43,He trusts in God; let God deliver Him now if He cares for Him and will have Him for He said I am the Son of God.
Matthew,27,44,And the robbers who were crucified with Him also abused and reproached and made sport of Him in the same way.
Matthew,27,45,Now from the sixth hour (noon) there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour (three o'clock).
Matthew,27,46,And about the ninth hour (three o'clock) Jesus cried with a loud voice Eli Eli lama sabachthani?--that is My God My God why have You abandoned Me [leaving Me helpless forsaking and failing Me in My need]?
Matthew,27,47,And some of the bystanders when they heard it said This Man is calling for Elijah!
Matthew,27,48,And one of them immediately ran and took a sponge soaked it with vinegar (a sour wine) and put it on a reed (staff) and was about to give it to Him to drink.
Matthew,27,49,But the others said Wait! Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him from death.
Matthew,27,50,And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit.
Matthew,27,51,And at once the curtain of the sanctuary of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; the earth shook and the rocks were split.
Matthew,27,52,The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep in death were raised [to life];
Matthew,27,53,And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
Matthew,27,54,When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus observed the earthquake and all that was happening they were terribly frightened and filled with awe and said Truly this was God's Son!
Matthew,27,55,There were also numerous women there looking on from a distance who were of those who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee ministering to Him.
Matthew,27,56,Among them were Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
Matthew,27,57,When it was evening there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph who also was a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew,27,58,He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Matthew,27,59,And Joseph took the body and rolled it up in a clean linen cloth used for swathing dead bodies
Matthew,27,60,And laid it in his own fresh ( undefiled) tomb which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a big boulder over the door of the tomb and went away.
Matthew,27,61,And Mary of Magdala and the other Mary kept sitting there opposite the tomb.
Matthew,27,62,The next day that is the day after the day of Preparation [for the Sabbath] the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate
Matthew,27,63,And said Sir we have just remembered how that vagabond Imposter said while He was still alive After three days I will rise again.
Matthew,27,64,Therefore give an order to have the tomb made secure and safeguarded until the third day for fear that His disciples will come and steal Him away and tell the people that He has risen from the dead and the last deception and fraud will be worse than the first.
Matthew,27,65,Pilate said to them You have a guard [of soldiers; take them and] go make it as secure as you can.
Matthew,27,66,So they went off and made the tomb secure by sealing the boulder a guard of soldiers being with them and remaining to watch.
Matthew,28,1,NOW AFTER the Sabbath near dawn of the first day of the week Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb.
Matthew,28,2,And behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the boulder back and sat upon it.
Matthew,28,3,His appearance was like lightning and his garments as white as snow.
Matthew,28,4,And those keeping guard were so frightened at the sight of him that they were agitated and they trembled and became like dead men.
Matthew,28,5,But the angel said to the women Do not be alarmed and frightened for I know that you are looking for Jesus Who was crucified.
Matthew,28,6,He is not here; He has risen as He said [He would do]. Come see the place where He lay.
Matthew,28,7,Then go quickly and tell His disciples He has risen from the dead and behold He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold I have told you.
Matthew,28,8,So they left the tomb hastily with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples.
Matthew,28,9,And as they went behold Jesus met them and said Hail (greetings)! And they went up to Him and clasped His feet and worshiped Him.
Matthew,28,10,Then Jesus said to them Do not be alarmed and afraid; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee and there they will see Me.
Matthew,28,11,While they were on their way behold some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had occurred.
Matthew,28,12,And when they [the chief priests] had gathered with the elders and had consulted together they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
Matthew,28,13,And said Tell people His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.
Matthew,28,14,And if the governor hears of it we will appease him and make you safe and free from trouble and care.
Matthew,28,15,So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been current among the Jews to the present day.
Matthew,28,16,Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain to which Jesus had directed and made appointment with them.
Matthew,28,17,And when they saw Him they fell down and worshiped Him; but some doubted.
Matthew,28,18,Jesus approached and breaking the silence said to them All authority (all power of rule) in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.
Matthew,28,19,Go then and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Matthew,28,20,Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you and behold I am with you all the days ( perpetually uniformly and on every occasion) to the [very] close and consummation of the age. Amen (so let it be).
Mark,1,1,THE BEGINNING [of the facts] of the good news (the Gospel) of Jesus Christ the Son of God.
Mark,1,2,Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold I send My messenger before Your face who will make ready Your way--
Mark,1,3,A voice of one crying in the wilderness [shouting in the desert] Prepare the way of the Lord make His beaten tracks straight (level and passable)!
Mark,1,4,John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness (desert) preaching a baptism [ obligating] repentance ( a change of one's mind for the better heartily amending one's ways with abhorrence of his past sins) in order to obtain forgiveness of and release from sins.
Mark,1,5,And there kept going out to him [continuously] all the country of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan as they were confessing their sins.
Mark,1,6,And John wore clothing woven of camel's hair and had a leather girdle around his loins and ate locusts and wild honey.
Mark,1,7,And he preached saying After me comes He Who is stronger (more powerful and more valiant) than I the strap of Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to stoop down and unloose.
Mark,1,8,I have baptized you with water but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
Mark,1,9,In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mark,1,10,And when He came up out of the water at once he [John] saw the heavens torn open and the [Holy] Spirit like a dove coming down [ to enter] into Him.
Mark,1,11,And there came a voice out from within heaven You are My Beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.
Mark,1,12,Immediately the [Holy] Spirit [from within] drove Him out into the wilderness (desert)
Mark,1,13,And He stayed in the wilderness (desert) forty days being tempted [all the while] by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered to Him [continually].
Mark,1,14,Now after John was arrested and put in prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God
Mark,1,15,And saying The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled (completed) and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ( have a change of mind which issues in regret for past sins and in change of conduct for the better) and believe (trust in rely on and adhere to) the good news (the Gospel).
Mark,1,16,And passing along the shore of the Sea of Galilee He saw Simon [Peter] and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net [to and fro] in the sea for they were fishermen.
Mark,1,17,And Jesus said to them Come after Me and be My disciples and I will make you to become fishers of men.
Mark,1,18,And at once they left their nets and [ yielding up all claim to them] followed [with] Him [ joining Him as disciples and siding with His party].
Mark,1,19,He went on a little farther and saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who were in [their] boat putting their nets in order.
Mark,1,20,And immediately He called out to them and [ abandoning all mutual claims] they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after Him [ to be His disciples side with His party and follow Him].
Mark,1,21,And they entered into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the synagogue and began to teach.
Mark,1,22,And they were completely astonished at His teaching for He was teaching as One Who possessed authority and not as the scribes.
Mark,1,23,Just at that time there was in their synagogue a man [who was in the power] of an unclean spirit; and now [immediately] he raised a deep and terrible cry from the depths of his throat saying
Mark,1,24,What have You to do with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!
Mark,1,25,And Jesus rebuked him saying Hush up (be muzzled gagged) and come out of him!
Mark,1,26,And the unclean spirit throwing the man into convulsions and screeching with a loud voice came out of him.
Mark,1,27,And they were all so amazed and almost terrified that they kept questioning and demanding one of another saying What is this? What new (fresh) teaching! With authority He gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they obey Him!
Mark,1,28,And immediately rumors concerning Him spread [everywhere] throughout all the region surrounding Galilee.
Mark,1,29,And at once He left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [Peter] and Andrew accompanied by James and John.
Mark,1,30,Now Simon's mother-in-law had for some time been lying sick with a fever and at once they told Him about her.
Mark,1,31,And He went up to her and took her by the hand and raised her up; and the fever left her and she began to wait on them.
Mark,1,32,Now when it was evening after the sun had set they brought to Him all who were sick and those under the power of demons
Mark,1,33,Until the whole town was gathered together about the door.
Mark,1,34,And He cured many who were afflicted with various diseases; and He drove out many demons but would not allow the demons to talk because they knew Him [ intuitively].
Mark,1,35,And in the morning long before daylight He got up and went out to a deserted place and there He prayed.
Mark,1,36,And Simon [Peter] and those who were with him followed Him [ pursuing Him eagerly and hunting Him out]
Mark,1,37,And they found Him and said to Him Everybody is looking for You.
Mark,1,38,And He said to them Let us be going on into the neighboring country towns that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.
Mark,1,39,[So] He went throughout the whole of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
Mark,1,40,And a leper came to Him begging Him on his knees and saying to Him If You are willing You are able to make me clean.
Mark,1,41,And being moved with pity and sympathy Jesus reached out His hand and touched him and said to him I am willing; be made clean!
Mark,1,42,And at once the leprosy [completely] left him and he was made clean [by being healed].
Mark,1,43,And Jesus charged him sternly (sharply and threateningly and with earnest admonition) and [acting with deep feeling thrust him forth and] sent him away at once
Mark,1,44,And said to him See that you tell nothing [of this] to anyone; but begone show yourself to the priest and offer for your purification what Moses commanded as a proof (an evidence and witness) to the people [that you are really healed].
Mark,1,45,But he went out and began to talk so freely about it and blaze abroad the news [spreading it everywhere] that [Jesus] could no longer openly go into a town but was outside in [lonely] desert places. But the people kept on coming to Him from all sides and every quarter.
Mark,2,1,AND JESUS having returned to Capernaum after some days it was rumored about that He was in the house [probably Peter's].
Mark,2,2,And so many people gathered together there that there was no longer room [for them] not even around the door; and He was discussing the Word.
Mark,2,3,Then they came bringing a paralytic to Him who had been picked up and was being carried by four men.
Mark,2,4,And when they could not get him to a place in front of Jesus because of the throng they dug through the roof above Him; and when they had scooped out an opening they let down the [ thickly padded] quilt or mat upon which the paralyzed man lay.
Mark,2,5,And when Jesus saw their faith [their confidence in God through Him] He said to the paralyzed man Son your sins are forgiven [you] and put away [that is the penalty is remitted the sense of guilt removed and you are made upright and in right standing with God].
Mark,2,6,Now some of the scribes were sitting there holding a dialogue with themselves as they questioned in their hearts
Mark,2,7,Why does this Man talk like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins [ remove guilt remit the penalty and bestow righteousness instead] except God alone?
Mark,2,8,And at once Jesus becoming fully aware in His spirit that they thus debated within themselves said to them Why do you argue (debate reason) about all this in your hearts?
Mark,2,9,Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man Your sins are forgiven and put away or to say Rise take up your sleeping pad or mat and start walking about [and keep on walking]?
Mark,2,10,But that you may know positively and beyond a doubt that the Son of Man has right and authority and power on earth to forgive sins--He said to the paralyzed man
Mark,2,11,I say to you arise pick up and carry your sleeping pad or mat and be going on home.
Mark,2,12,And he arose at once and picked up the sleeping pad or mat and went out before them all so that they were all amazed and recognized and praised and thanked God saying We have never seen anything like this before!
Mark,2,13,[Jesus] went out again along the seashore; and all the multitude kept gathering about Him and He kept teaching them.
Mark,2,14,And as He was passing by He saw Levi (Matthew) son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office and He said to him Follow Me! [Be joined to Me as a disciple side with My party!] And he arose and joined Him as His disciple and sided with His party and accompanied Him.
Mark,2,15,And as Jesus together with His disciples sat at table in his [Levi's] house many tax collectors and persons [ definitely stained] with sin were dining with Him for there were many who walked the same road (followed) with Him.
Mark,2,16,And the scribes [belonging to the party] of the Pharisees when they saw that He was eating with [those definitely known to be especially wicked] sinners and tax collectors said to His disciples Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and [notorious] sinners?
Mark,2,17,And when Jesus heard it He said to them Those who are strong and well have no need of a physician but those who are weak and sick; I came not to call the righteous ones to repentance but sinners (the erring ones and all those not free from sin).
Mark,2,18,Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were observing a fast; and [some people] came and asked Jesus Why are John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting but Your disciples are not doing so?
Mark,2,19,Jesus answered them Can the wedding guests fast (abstain from food and drink) while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.
Mark,2,20,But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and they will fast in that day.
Mark,2,21,No one sews a patch of unshrunken (new) goods on an old garment; if he does the patch tears away from it the new from the old and the rent (tear) becomes bigger and worse [than it was before].
Mark,2,22,And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost and the bottles destroyed; but new wine is to be put in new (fresh) wineskins.
Mark,2,23,One Sabbath He was going along beside the fields of standing grain and as they made their way His disciples began to pick off the grains.
Mark,2,24,And the Pharisees said to Him Look! Why are they doing what is not permitted or lawful on the Sabbath?
Mark,2,25,And He said to them Have you never [even] read what David did when he was in need and was hungry he and those who were accompanying him?--
Mark,2,26,How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was the high priest and ate the sacred loaves set forth [before God] which it is not permitted or lawful for any but the priests to eat and [how he] also gave [them] to those who were with him? [I Sam. 21:1-6; II Sam. 8:17.]
Mark,2,27,And Jesus said to them The Sabbath was made on account and for the sake of man not man for the Sabbath;
Mark,2,28,So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Mark,3,1,AGAIN JESUS went into a synagogue and a man was there who had one withered hand [ as the result of accident or disease].
Mark,3,2,And [the Pharisees] kept watching Jesus [closely] to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath so that they might get a charge to bring against Him [ formally].
Mark,3,3,And He said to the man who had the withered hand Get up [and stand here] in the midst.
Mark,3,4,And He said to them Is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to take it? But they kept silence.
Mark,3,5,And He glanced around at them with vexation and anger grieved at the hardening of their hearts and said to the man Hold out your hand. He held it out and his hand was [completely] restored.
Mark,3,6,Then the Pharisees went out and immediately held a consultation with the Herodians against Him how they might [devise some means to] put Him to death.
Mark,3,7,And Jesus retired with His disciples to the lake and a great throng from Galilee followed Him. Also from Judea
Mark,3,8,And from Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon--a vast multitude hearing all the many things that He was doing came to Him.
Mark,3,9,And He told His disciples to have a little boat in [constant] readiness for Him because of the crowd lest they press hard upon Him and crush Him.
Mark,3,10,For He had healed so many that all who had distressing bodily diseases kept falling upon Him and pressing upon Him in order that they might touch Him.
Mark,3,11,And the spirits the unclean ones as often as they might see Him fell down before Him and kept screaming out You are the Son of God!
Mark,3,12,And He charged them strictly and severely under penalty again and again that they should not make Him known.
Mark,3,13,And He went up on the hillside and called to Him [ for Himself] those whom He wanted and chose and they came to Him.
Mark,3,14,And He appointed twelve to continue to be with Him and that He might send them out to preach [as apostles or special messengers]
Mark,3,15,And to have authority and power to heal the sick and to drive out demons:
Mark,3,16,[They were] Simon and He surnamed [him] Peter;
Mark,3,17,James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James and He surnamed them Boanerges that is Sons of Thunder;
Mark,3,18,And Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew (Nathaniel) and Matthew and Thomas and James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus (Judas not Iscariot) and Simon the Cananaean [also called Zelotes]
Mark,3,19,And Judas Iscariot he who betrayed Him.
Mark,3,20,Then He went to a house [probably Peter's] but a throng came together again so that Jesus and His disciples could not even take food.
Mark,3,21,And when those who belonged to Him ( His kinsmen) heard it they went out to take Him by force for they kept saying He is out of His mind (beside Himself deranged)!
Mark,3,22,And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said He is possessed by Beelzebub and By [the help of] the prince of demons He is casting out demons.
Mark,3,23,And He summoned them to Him and said to them in parables (illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them) How can Satan drive out Satan?
Mark,3,24,And if a kingdom is divided and rebelling against itself that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark,3,25,And if a house is divided (split into factions and rebelling) against itself that house will not be able to last.
Mark,3,26,And if Satan has raised an insurrection against himself and is divided he cannot stand but is [surely] coming to an end.
Mark,3,27,But no one can go into a strong man's house and ransack his household goods right and left and seize them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may [thoroughly] plunder his house.
Mark,3,28,Truly and solemnly I say to you all sins will be forgiven the sons of men and whatever abusive and blasphemous things they utter;
Mark,3,29,But whoever speaks abusively against or maliciously misrepresents the Holy Spirit can never get forgiveness but is guilty of and is in the grasp of an everlasting trespass.
Mark,3,30,For they persisted in saying He has an unclean spirit.
Mark,3,31,Then His mother and His brothers came and standing outside they sent word to Him calling [for] Him.
Mark,3,32,And a crowd was sitting around Him and they said to Him Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside asking for You.
Mark,3,33,And He replied Who are My mother and My brothers?
Mark,3,34,And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him He said See! Here are My mother and My brothers;
Mark,3,35,For whoever does the things God wills is My brother and sister and mother!
Mark,4,1,AGAIN JESUS began to teach beside the lake. And a very great crowd gathered about Him so that He got into a ship in order to sit in it on the sea and the whole crowd was at the lakeside on the shore.
Mark,4,2,And He taught them many things in parables (illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them) and in His teaching He said to them:
Mark,4,3,Give attention to this! Behold a sower went out to sow.
Mark,4,4,And as he was sowing some seed fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up.
Mark,4,5,Other seed [of the same kind] fell on ground full of rocks where it had not much soil; and at once it sprang up because it had no depth of soil;
Mark,4,6,And when the sun came up it was scorched and because it had not taken root it withered away.
Mark,4,7,Other seed [of the same kind] fell among thorn plants and the thistles grew and pressed together and utterly choked and suffocated it and it yielded no grain.
Mark,4,8,And other seed [of the same kind] fell into good (well-adapted) soil and brought forth grain growing up and increasing and yielded up to thirty times as much and sixty times as much and even a hundred times as much as had been sown.
Mark,4,9,And He said He who has ears to hear let him be hearing [and let him consider and comprehend].
Mark,4,10,And as soon as He was alone those who were around Him with the Twelve [apostles] began to ask Him about the parables.
Mark,4,11,And He said to them To you has been entrusted the mystery of the kingdom of God [that is the secret counsels of God which are hidden from the ungodly]; but for those outside [ of our circle] everything becomes a parable
Mark,4,12,In order that they may [indeed] look and look but not see and perceive and may hear and hear but not grasp and comprehend lest haply they should turn again and it [ their willful rejection of the truth] should be forgiven them.
Mark,4,13,And He said to them Do you not discern and understand this parable? How then is it possible for you to discern and understand all the parables?
Mark,4,14,The sower sows the Word.
Mark,4,15,The ones along the path are those who have the Word sown [in their hearts] but when they hear Satan comes at once and [by force] takes away the message which is sown in them.
Mark,4,16,And in the same way the ones sown upon stony ground are those who when they hear the Word at once receive and accept and welcome it with joy;
Mark,4,17,And they have no real root in themselves and so they endure for a little while; then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Word they immediately are offended (become displeased indignant resentful) and they stumble and fall away.
Mark,4,18,And the ones sown among the thorns are others who hear the Word;
Mark,4,19,Then the cares and anxieties of the world and distractions of the age and the pleasure and delight and false glamour and deceitfulness of riches and the craving and passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the Word and it becomes fruitless.
Mark,4,20,And those sown on the good (well-adapted) soil are the ones who hear the Word and receive and accept and welcome it and bear fruit--some thirty times as much as was sown some sixty times as much and some [even] a hundred times as much.
Mark,4,21,And He said to them Is the lamp brought in to be put under a peck measure or under a bed and not [to be put] on the lampstand?
Mark,4,22,[ Things are hidden temporarily only as a means to revelation.] For there is nothing hidden except to be revealed nor is anything [temporarily] kept secret except in order that it may be made known.
Mark,4,23,If any man has ears to hear let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend.
Mark,4,24,And He said to them Be careful what you are hearing. The measure [of thought and study] you give [to the truth you hear] will be the measure [of virtue and knowledge] that comes back to you--and more [besides] will be given to you who hear.
Mark,4,25,For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has nothing even what he has will be taken away [ by force]
Mark,4,26,And He said The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed upon the ground
Mark,4,27,And then continues sleeping and rising night and day while the seed sprouts and grows and increases--he knows not how.
Mark,4,28,The earth produces [acting] by itself--first the blade then the ear then the full grain in the ear.
Mark,4,29,But when the grain is ripe and permits immediately he sends forth [the reapers] and puts in the sickle because the harvest stands ready.
Mark,4,30,And He said With what can we compare the kingdom of God or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it?
Mark,4,31,It is like a grain of mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all seeds upon the earth;
Mark,4,32,Yet after it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all garden herbs and puts out large branches so that the birds of the air are able to make nests and dwell in its shade.
Mark,4,33,With many such parables [Jesus] spoke the Word to them as they were able to hear and to comprehend and understand.
Mark,4,34,He did not tell them anything without a parable; but privately to His disciples ( those who were peculiarly His own) He explained everything [fully].
Mark,4,35,On that same day [when] evening had come He said to them Let us go over to the other side [of the lake].
Mark,4,36,And leaving the throng they took Him with them [just] as He was in the boat [in which He was sitting]. And other boats were with Him.
Mark,4,37,And a furious storm of wind [ of hurricane proportions] arose and the waves kept beating into the boat so that it was already becoming filled.
Mark,4,38,But He [Himself] was in the stern [of the boat] asleep on the [leather] cushion; and they awoke Him and said to Him Master do You not care that we are perishing?
Mark,4,39,And He arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea Hush now! Be still (muzzled)! And the wind ceased ( sank to rest as if exhausted by its beating) and there was [immediately] a great calm ( a perfect peacefulness).
Mark,4,40,He said to them Why are you so timid and fearful? How is it that you have no faith (no firmly relying trust)?
Mark,4,41,And they were filled with great awe and feared exceedingly and said one to another Who then is this that even wind and sea obey Him?
Mark,5,1,THEY CAME to the other side of the sea to the region of the Gerasenes.
Mark,5,2,And as soon as He got out of the boat there met Him out of the tombs a man [under the power] of an unclean spirit.
Mark,5,3,This man continually lived among the tombs and no one could subdue him any more even with a chain;
Mark,5,4,For he had been bound often with shackles for the feet and handcuffs but the handcuffs of [light] chains he wrenched apart and the shackles he rubbed and ground together and broke in pieces; and no one had strength enough to restrain or tame him.
Mark,5,5,Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always shrieking and screaming and beating and bruising and cutting himself with stones.
Mark,5,6,And when from a distance he saw Jesus he ran and fell on his knees before Him in homage
Mark,5,7,And crying out with a loud voice he said What have You to do with me Jesus Son of the Most High God? [What is there in common between us?] I solemnly implore you by God do not begin to torment me!
Mark,5,8,For Jesus was commanding Come out of the man you unclean spirit!
Mark,5,9,And He asked him What is your name? He replied My name is Legion for we are many.
Mark,5,10,And he kept begging Him urgently not to send them [himself and the other demons] away out of that region.
Mark,5,11,Now a great herd of hogs was grazing there on the hillside.
Mark,5,12,And the demons begged Him saying Send us to the hogs that we may go into them!
Mark,5,13,So He gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out [of the man] and entered into the hogs; and the herd numbering about 2000 rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.
Mark,5,14,The hog feeders ran away and told [it] in the town and in the country. And [the people] came to see what it was that had taken place.
Mark,5,15,And they came to Jesus and looked intently and searchingly at the man who had been a demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind [the same man] who had had the legion [of demons]; and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear.
Mark,5,16,And those who had seen it related in full what had happened to the man possessed by demons and to the hogs.
Mark,5,17,And they began to beg [Jesus] to leave their neighborhood.
Mark,5,18,And when He had stepped into the boat the man who had been controlled by the unclean spirits kept begging Him that he might be with Him.
Mark,5,19,But Jesus refused to permit him but said to him Go home to your own [family and relatives and friends] and bring back word to them of how much the Lord has done for you and [how He has] had sympathy for you and mercy on you.
Mark,5,20,And he departed and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [the region of the ten cities] how much Jesus had done for him and all the people were astonished and marveled.
Mark,5,21,And when Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side a great throng gathered about Him and He was at the lakeshore.
Mark,5,22,Then one of the rulers of the synagogue came up Jairus by name; and seeing Him he prostrated himself at His feet
Mark,5,23,And begged Him earnestly saying My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.
Mark,5,24,And Jesus went with him; and a great crowd kept following Him and pressed Him from all sides [so as almost to suffocate Him].
Mark,5,25,And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years
Mark,5,26,And who had endured much suffering under [the hands of] many physicians and had spent all that she had and was no better but instead grew worse.
Mark,5,27,She had heard the reports concerning Jesus and she came up behind Him in the throng and touched His garment
Mark,5,28,For she kept saying If I only touch His garments I shall be restored to health.
Mark,5,29,And immediately her flow of blood was dried up at the source and [ suddenly] she felt in her body that she was healed of her [ distressing] ailment.
Mark,5,30,And Jesus recognizing in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth turned around immediately in the crowd and said Who touched My clothes?
Mark,5,31,And the disciples kept saying to Him You see the crowd pressing hard around You from all sides and You ask Who touched Me?
Mark,5,32,Still He kept looking around to see her who had done it.
Mark,5,33,But the woman knowing what had been done for her though alarmed and frightened and trembling fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.
Mark,5,34,And He said to her Daughter your faith (your trust and confidence in Me springing from faith in God) has restored you to health. Go in (into) peace and be continually healed and freed from your [ distressing bodily] disease.
Mark,5,35,While He was still speaking there came some from the ruler's house who said [to Jairus] Your daughter has died. Why bother and distress the Teacher any further?
Mark,5,36,Overhearing but ignoring what they said Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear; only keep on believing.
Mark,5,37,And He permitted no one to accompany Him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
Mark,5,38,When they arrived at the house of the ruler of the synagogue He looked [carefully and with understanding] at [the] tumult and the people weeping and wailing loudly.
Mark,5,39,And when He had gone in He said to them Why do you make an uproar and weep? The little girl is not dead but is sleeping.
Mark,5,40,And they laughed and jeered at Him. But He put them all out and taking the child's father and mother and those who were with Him He went in where the little girl was lying.
Mark,5,41,Gripping her [firmly] by the hand He said to her Talitha cumi--which translated is Little girl I say to you arise [ from the sleep of death]!
Mark,5,42,And instantly the girl got up and started walking around--for she was twelve years old. And they were utterly astonished and overcome with amazement.
Mark,5,43,And He strictly commanded and warned them that no one should know this and He [ expressly] told them to give her [something] to eat.
Mark,6,1,JESUS WENT away from there and came to His [own] country and hometown [Nazareth] and His disciples followed [with] Him.
Mark,6,2,And on the Sabbath He began to teach in the synagogue; and many who listened to Him were utterly astonished saying Where did this Man acquire all this? What is the wisdom [the broad and full intelligence which has been] given to Him? What mighty works and exhibitions of power are wrought by His hands!
Mark,6,3,Is not this the Carpenter the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here among us? And they took offense at Him and were hurt [that is they disapproved of Him and it hindered them from acknowledging His authority] and they were caused to stumble and fall.
Mark,6,4,But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor (deference reverence) except in his [own] country and among [his] relatives and in his [own] house.
Mark,6,5,And He was not able to do even one work of power there except that He laid His hands on a few sickly people [and] cured them.
Mark,6,6,And He marveled because of their unbelief (their lack of faith in Him). And He went about among the surrounding villages and continued teaching.
Mark,6,7,And He called to Him the Twelve [apostles] and began to send them out [as His ambassadors] two by two and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits.
Mark,6,8,He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick--no bread no wallet for a collection bag no money in their belts (girdles purses)--
Mark,6,9,But to go with sandals on their feet and not to put on two tunics (undergarments).
Mark,6,10,And He told them Wherever you go into a house stay there until you leave that place.
Mark,6,11,And if any community will not receive and accept and welcome you and they refuse to listen to you when you depart shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I tell you it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment day than for that town.
Mark,6,12,So they went out and preached that men should repent [ that they should change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways with abhorrence of their past sins].
Mark,6,13,And they drove out many unclean spirits and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.
Mark,6,14,King Herod heard of it for [Jesus'] name had become well known. He and they [of his court] said John the Baptist has been raised from the dead; that is why these mighty powers [ of performing miracles] are at work in Him.
Mark,6,15,[But] others kept saying It is Elijah! And others said It is a prophet like one of the prophets [of old].
Mark,6,16,But when Herod heard [of it] he said [ This very] John whom I beheaded has been raised [from the dead].
Mark,6,17,For [this] Herod himself had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip's wife because he [Herod] had married her.
Mark,6,18,For John had told Herod It is not lawful and you have no right to have your brother's wife.
Mark,6,19,And Herodias was angry (enraged) with him and held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him; but she could not
Mark,6,20,For Herod had [ a reverential] fear of John knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and [continually] kept him safe [ under guard]. When he heard he was much perplexed; and [yet] he heard him gladly.
Mark,6,21,But an opportune time came [for Herodias] when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and the high military commanders and chief men of Galilee.
Mark,6,22,For when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced she pleased and fascinated Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl Ask me for whatever you desire and I will give it to you.
Mark,6,23,And he put himself under oath to her Whatever you ask me I will give it to you even to the half of my kingdom.
Mark,6,24,Then she left the room and said to her mother What shall I ask for [myself]? And she replied The head of John the Baptist!
Mark,6,25,And she rushed back instantly to the king and requested saying I wish you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.
Mark,6,26,And the king was deeply pained and grieved and exceedingly sorry but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to slight her [by breaking faith with her].
Mark,6,27,And immediately the king sent off one [of the soldiers] of his bodyguard and gave him orders to bring [John's] head. He went and beheaded him in the prison
Mark,6,28,And brought his head on a platter and handed it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother.
Mark,6,29,When his disciples learned of it they came and took [John's] body and laid it in a tomb.
Mark,6,30,The apostles [sent out as missionaries] came back and gathered together to Jesus and told Him all that they had done and taught.
Mark,6,31,And He said to them [ As for you] come away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while--for many were [continually] coming and going and they had not even leisure enough to eat.
Mark,6,32,And they went away in a boat to a solitary place by themselves.
Mark,6,33,Now many [people] saw them going and recognized them and they ran there on foot from all the surrounding towns and they got there ahead [of those in the boat].
Mark,6,34,As Jesus landed He saw a great crowd waiting and He was moved with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.
Mark,6,35,And when the day was already far gone His disciples came to Him and said This is a desolate and isolated place and the hour is now late.
Mark,6,36,Send the crowds away to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat.
Mark,6,37,But He replied to them Give them something to eat yourselves. And they said to Him Shall we go and buy 200 denarii [about forty dollars] worth of bread and give it to them to eat? [II Kings 4:42-44.]
Mark,6,38,And He said to them How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they [had looked and] knew they said Five [loaves] and two fish.
Mark,6,39,Then He commanded the people all to recline on the green grass by companies.
Mark,6,40,So they threw themselves down in ranks of hundreds and fifties [with the regularity of an arrangement of beds of herbs looking like so many garden plots].
Mark,6,41,And taking the five loaves and two fish He looked up to heaven and praising God gave thanks and broke the loaves and kept on giving them to the disciples to set before the people; and He [also] divided the two fish among [them] all.
Mark,6,42,And they all ate and were satisfied.
Mark,6,43,And they took up twelve [ small hand] baskets full of broken pieces [from the loaves] and of the fish.
Mark,6,44,And those who ate the loaves were 5000 men.
Mark,6,45,And at once He insisted that the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida while He was sending the throng away.
Mark,6,46,And after He had taken leave of them He went off into the hills to pray.
Mark,6,47,Now when evening had come the boat was out in the middle of the lake and He was by Himself on the land.
Mark,6,48,And having seen that they were troubled and tormented in [their] rowing for the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night [between 3:00-6:00 a.m.] He came to them walking [directly] on the sea. And He acted as if He meant to pass by them
Mark,6,49,But when they saw Him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and raised a [deep throaty] shriek of terror.
Mark,6,50,For they all saw Him and were agitated (troubled and filled with fear and dread). But immediately He talked with them and said Take heart! I AM! Stop being alarmed and afraid.
Mark,6,51,And He went up into the boat with them and the wind ceased ( sank to rest as if exhausted by its own beating). And they were astonished exceedingly [beyond measure]
Mark,6,52,For they failed to consider or understand [the teaching and meaning of the miracle of] the loaves; [in fact] their hearts had grown callous [had become dull and had lost the power of understanding].
Mark,6,53,And when they had crossed over they reached the land of Gennesaret and came to [anchor at] the shore.
Mark,6,54,As soon as they got out of the boat [the people] recognized Him
Mark,6,55,And they ran about the whole countryside and began to carry around sick people on their sleeping pads or mats to any place where they heard that He was.
Mark,6,56,And wherever He came into villages or cities or the country they would lay the sick in the marketplaces and beg Him that they might touch even the fringe of His outer garment and as many as touched Him were restored to health.
Mark,7,1,NOW THERE gathered together to [Jesus] the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem
Mark,7,2,For they had seen that some of His disciples ate with common hands that is unwashed [with hands defiled and unhallowed because they had not given them a ceremonial washing]--
Mark,7,3,For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless [merely for ceremonial reasons] they wash their hands [diligently up to the elbow] with clenched fist adhering [carefully and faithfully] to the tradition of [practices and customs handed down to them by] their forefathers [to be observed].
Mark,7,4,And [when they come] from the marketplace they do not eat unless they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions [oral man-made laws handed down to them which they observe faithfully and diligently such as] the washing of cups and wooden pitchers and widemouthed jugs and utensils of copper and beds--
Mark,7,5,And the Pharisees and scribes kept asking [Jesus] Why do Your disciples not order their way of living according to the tradition handed down by the forefathers [to be observed] but eat with hands unwashed and ceremonially not purified?
Mark,7,6,But He said to them Excellently and truly [ so that there will be no room for blame] did Isaiah prophesy of you the pretenders and hypocrites as it stands written: These people [constantly] honor Me with their lips but their hearts hold off and are far distant from Me.
Mark,7,7,In vain (fruitlessly and without profit) do they worship Me ordering and teaching [to be obeyed] as doctrines the commandments and precepts of men.
Mark,7,8,You disregard and give up and ask to depart from you the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men [keeping it carefully and faithfully].
Mark,7,9,And He said to them You have a fine way of rejecting [thus thwarting and nullifying and doing away with] the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition (your own human regulations)!
Mark,7,10,For Moses said Honor (revere with tenderness of feeling and deference) your father and your mother and He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother let him surely die.
Mark,7,11,But [as for you] you say A man is exempt if he tells [his] father or [his] mother What you would otherwise have gained from me [everything I have that would have been of use to you] is Corban that is is a gift [already given as an offering to God]
Mark,7,12,Then you no longer are permitting him to do anything for [his] father or mother [but are letting him off from helping them].
Mark,7,13,Thus you are nullifying and making void and of no effect [the authority of] the Word of God through your tradition which you [in turn] hand on. And many things of this kind you are doing.
Mark,7,14,And He called the people to [Him] again and said to them Listen to Me all of you and understand [what I say].
Mark,7,15,There is not [even] one thing outside a man which by going into him can pollute and defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him and make him unhallowed and unclean.
Mark,7,16,If any man has ears to hear let him be listening [and let him perceive and comprehend by hearing].
Mark,7,17,And when He had left the crowd and had gone into the house His disciples began asking Him about the parable.
Mark,7,18,And He said to them Then are you also unintelligent and dull and without understanding? Do you not discern and see that whatever goes into a man from the outside cannot make him unhallowed or unclean
Mark,7,19,Since it does not reach and enter his heart but [only his] digestive tract and so passes on [into the place designed to receive waste]? Thus He was making and declaring all foods [ceremonially] clean [that is abolishing the ceremonial distinctions of the Levitical Law].
Mark,7,20,And He said What comes out of a man is what makes a man unclean and renders [him] unhallowed.
Mark,7,21,For from within [that is] out of the hearts of men come base and wicked thoughts sexual immorality stealing murder adultery
Mark,7,22,Coveting (a greedy desire to have more wealth) dangerous and destructive wickedness deceit; unrestrained (indecent) conduct; an evil eye (envy) slander (evil speaking malicious misrepresentation abusiveness) pride ( the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man) foolishness (folly lack of sense recklessness thoughtlessness).
Mark,7,23,All these evil [purposes and desires] come from within and they make the man unclean and render him unhallowed.
Mark,7,24,And Jesus arose and went away from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He went into a house and did not want anyone to know [that He was there]; but it was not possible for Him to be hidden [from public notice].
Mark,7,25,Instead at once a woman whose little daughter had (was under the control of) an unclean spirit heard about Him and came and flung herself down at His feet.
Mark,7,26,Now the woman was a Greek (Gentile) a Syrophoenician by nationality. And she kept begging Him to drive the demon out of her little daughter.
Mark,7,27,And He said to her First let the children be fed for it is not becoming or proper or right to take the children's bread and throw it to the [little house] dogs.
Mark,7,28,But she answered Him Yes Lord yet even the small pups under the table eat the little children's scraps of food.
Mark,7,29,And He said to her Because of this saying you may go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter [permanently].
Mark,7,30,And she went home and found the child thrown on the couch and the demon departed.
Mark,7,31,Soon after this Jesus coming back from the region of Tyre passed through Sidon on to the Sea of Galilee through the region of Decapolis [the ten cities].
Mark,7,32,And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty in speaking and they begged Jesus to place His hand upon him.
Mark,7,33,And taking him aside from the crowd [privately] He thrust His fingers into the man's ears and spat and touched his tongue;
Mark,7,34,And looking up to heaven He sighed as He said Ephphatha which means Be opened!
Mark,7,35,And his ears were opened his tongue was loosed and he began to speak distinctly and as he should.
Mark,7,36,And Jesus [ in His own interest] admonished and ordered them sternly and expressly to tell no one; but the more He commanded them the more zealously they proclaimed it.
Mark,7,37,And they were overwhelmingly astonished saying He has done everything excellently (commendably and nobly)! He even makes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak!
Mark,8,1,IN THOSE days when [again] an immense crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat Jesus called His disciples to Him and told them
Mark,8,2,I have pity and sympathy for the people and My heart goes out to them for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [left] to eat;
Mark,8,3,And if I send them away to their homes hungry they will be feeble through exhaustion and faint along the road; and some of them have come a long way.
Mark,8,4,And His disciples replied to Him How can anyone fill and satisfy [these people] with loaves of bread here in [this] desolate and uninhabited region?
Mark,8,5,And He asked them How many loaves have you? They said Seven.
Mark,8,6,And He commanded the multitude to recline upon the ground and He [then] took the seven loaves [of bread] and having given thanks He broke them and kept on giving them to His disciples to put before [the people] and they placed them before the crowd.
Mark,8,7,And they had a few small fish; and when He had praised God and given thanks and asked Him to bless them [to their use] He ordered that these also should be set before [them].
Mark,8,8,And they ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven [ large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Mark,8,9,And there were about 4000 people. And He dismissed them
Mark,8,10,And at once He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha (or Magdala).
Mark,8,11,The Pharisees came and began to argue with and question Him demanding from Him a sign (an attesting miracle from heaven) [maliciously] to test Him.
Mark,8,12,And He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said Why does this generation demand a sign? Positively I say to you no sign shall be given this generation.
Mark,8,13,And He went away and left them and getting into the boat again He departed to the other side.
Mark,8,14,Now they had [ completely] forgotten to bring bread and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
Mark,8,15,And Jesus [repeatedly and expressly] charged and admonished them saying Look out; keep on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod and the Herodians.
Mark,8,16,And they discussed it and reasoned with one another It is because we have no bread.
Mark,8,17,And being aware [of it] Jesus said to them Why are you reasoning and saying it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet discern or understand? Are your hearts in [a settled state of] hardness?
Mark,8,18,Having eyes do you not see [with them] and having ears do you not hear and perceive and understand the sense of what is said? And do you not remember?
Mark,8,19,When I broke the five loaves for the 5000 how many [ small hand] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to Him Twelve.
Mark,8,20,And [when I broke] the seven loaves for the 4000 how many [ large provision] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to Him Seven.
Mark,8,21,And He kept repeating Do you not yet understand?
Mark,8,22,And they came to Bethsaida. And [people] brought to Him a blind man and begged Him to touch him.
Mark,8,23,And He caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him He asked him Do you [ possibly] see anything?
Mark,8,24,And he looked up and said I see people but [they look] like trees walking.
Mark,8,25,Then He put His hands on his eyes again; and the man looked intently [that is fixed his eyes on definite objects] and he was restored and saw everything distinctly [even what was at a distance].
Mark,8,26,And He sent him away to his house telling [him] Do not [even] enter the village or tell anyone there.
Mark,8,27,And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples Who do people say that I am?
Mark,8,28,And they answered [Him] John the Baptist; and others [say] Elijah; but others one of the prophets.
Mark,8,29,And He asked them But who do you yourselves say that I am? Peter replied to Him You are the Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Mark,8,30,And He charged them sharply to tell no one about Him.
Mark,8,31,And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must of necessity suffer many things and be tested and disapproved and rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be put to death and after three days rise again [ from death].
Mark,8,32,And He said this freely (frankly plainly and explicitly making it unmistakable). And Peter took Him by the hand and led Him aside and then [facing Him] began to rebuke Him.
Mark,8,33,But turning around [His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples He rebuked Peter saying Get behind Me Satan! For you do not have a mind intent on promoting what God wills but what pleases men [you are not on God's side but that of men].
Mark,8,34,And Jesus called [to Him] the throng with His disciples and said to them If anyone intends to come after Me let him deny himself [forget ignore disown and lose sight of himself and his own interests] and take up his cross and [ joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party] follow with Me [continually cleaving steadfastly to Me].
Mark,8,35,For whoever wants to save his [ higher spiritual eternal] life will lose it [the lower natural temporal life which is lived only on earth]; and whoever gives up his life [which is lived only on earth] for My sake and the Gospel's will save it [his higher spiritual life in the eternal kingdom of God].
Mark,8,36,For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life [ in the eternal kingdom of God]?
Mark,8,37,For what can a man give as an exchange ( a compensation a ransom in return) for his [blessed] life [ in the eternal kingdom of God]?
Mark,8,38,For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous (unfaithful) and [preeminently] sinful generation of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory (splendor and majesty) of His Father with the holy angels.
Mark,9,1,AND JESUS said to them Truly and solemnly I say to you there are some standing here who will in no way taste death before they see the kingdom of God come in [its] power.
Mark,9,2,Six days after this Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves. And He was transfigured before them and became resplendent with divine brightness.
Mark,9,3,And His garments became glistening intensely white as no fuller (cloth dresser launderer) on earth could bleach them.
Mark,9,4,And Elijah appeared [there] to them accompanied by Moses and they were holding [a protracted] conversation with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,And Peter took up the conversation saying Master it is good and suitable and beautiful for us to be here. Let us make three booths (tents)--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
Mark,9,6,For he did not [really] know what to say for they were in a violent fright ( aghast with dread).
Mark,9,7,And a cloud threw a shadow upon them and a voice came out of the cloud saying This is My Son the [ most dearworthy] Beloved One. Be constantly listening to and obeying Him!
Mark,9,8,And looking around they suddenly no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus only.
Mark,9,9,And as they were coming back down the mountain He admonished and expressly ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man should rise from among the dead.
Mark,9,10,So they carefully and faithfully kept the matter to themselves questioning and disputing with one another about what rising from among the dead meant.
Mark,9,11,And they asked Him Why do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first?
Mark,9,12,And He said to them Elijah it is true does come first to restore all things and set them to rights. And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be utterly despised and be treated with contempt and rejected?
Mark,9,13,But I tell you that Elijah has already come and [people] did to him whatever they desired as it is written of him.
Mark,9,14,And when they came to the [nine] disciples they saw a great crowd around them and scribes questioning and disputing with them.
Mark,9,15,And immediately all the crowd when they saw Jesus [ returning from the holy mount His face and person yet glistening] they were greatly amazed and ran up to Him [and] greeted Him.
Mark,9,16,And He asked them About what are you questioning and discussing with them?
Mark,9,17,And one of the throng replied to Him Teacher I brought my son to You for he has a dumb spirit.
Mark,9,18,And wherever it lays hold of him [so as to make him its own] it dashes him down and convulses him and he foams [at the mouth] and grinds his teeth and he [ falls into a motionless stupor and] is wasting away. And I asked Your disciples to drive it out and they were not able [to do it].
Mark,9,19,And He answered them O unbelieving generation [without any faith]! How long shall I [have to do] with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to Me.
Mark,9,20,So they brought [the boy] to Him and when the spirit saw Him at once it completely convulsed the boy and he fell to the ground and kept rolling about foaming [at the mouth].
Mark,9,21,And [Jesus] asked his father How long has he had this? And he answered From the time he was a little boy.
Mark,9,22,And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water intending to kill him. But if You can do anything do have pity on us and help us.
Mark,9,23,And Jesus said [You say to Me] If You can do anything? [Why] all things can be (are possible) to him who believes!
Mark,9,24,At once the father of the boy gave [an eager piercing inarticulate] cry with tears and he said Lord I believe! [Constantly] help my weakness of faith!
Mark,9,25,But when Jesus noticed that a crowd [of people] came running together He rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it You dumb and deaf spirit I charge you to come out of him and never go into him again.
Mark,9,26,And after giving a [hoarse clamoring fear-stricken] shriek of anguish and convulsing him terribly it came out; and the boy lay [pale and motionless] like a corpse so that many of them said He is dead.
Mark,9,27,But Jesus took [ a strong grip of] his hand and began lifting him up and he stood.
Mark,9,28,And when He had gone indoors His disciples asked Him privately Why could not we drive it out?
Mark,9,29,And He replied to them This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.
Mark,9,30,They went on from there and passed along through Galilee. And He did not wish to have anyone know it
Mark,9,31,For He was [engaged for the time being in] teaching His disciples. He said to them The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men and they will put Him to death; and when He has been killed after three days He will rise [ from death].
Mark,9,32,But they did not comprehend what He was saying and they were afraid to ask Him [what this statement meant].
Mark,9,33,And they arrived at Capernaum; and when [they were] in the house He asked them What were you discussing and arguing about on the road?
Mark,9,34,But they kept still for on the road they had discussed and disputed with one another as to who was the greatest.
Mark,9,35,And He sat down and called the Twelve [apostles] and He said to them If anyone desires to be first he must be last of all and servant of all.
Mark,9,36,And He took a little child and put him in the center of their group; and taking him in [His] arms He said to them
Mark,9,37,Whoever in My name and for My sake accepts and receives and welcomes one such child also accepts and receives and welcomes Me; and whoever so receives Me receives not only Me but Him Who sent Me.
Mark,9,38,John said to Him Teacher we saw a man who does not follow along with us driving out demons in Your name and we forbade him to do it because he is not one of our band [of Your disciples].
Mark,9,39,But Jesus said Do not restrain or hinder or forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me.
Mark,9,40,For he who is not against us is for us.
Mark,9,41,For I tell you truly whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to and bear the name of Christ will by no means fail to get his reward.
Mark,9,42,And whoever causes one of these little ones (these believers) who acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin it would be better (more profitable and wholesome) for him if a [huge] millstone were hung about his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
Mark,9,43,And if your hand puts a stumbling block before you and causes you to sin cut it off! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to go into life [ that is really worthwhile] maimed than with two hands to go to hell (Gehenna) into the fire that cannot be put out.
Mark,9,45,And if your foot is a cause of stumbling and sin to you cut it off! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter into life [that is really worthwhile] crippled than having two feet to be cast into hell (Gehenna).
Mark,9,47,And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin pluck it out! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell (Gehenna)
Mark,9,48,Where their worm [ which preys on the inhabitants and is a symbol of the wounds inflicted on the man himself by his sins] does not die and the fire is not put out.
Mark,9,49,For everyone shall be salted with fire.
Mark,9,50,Salt is good (beneficial) but if salt has lost its saltness how will you restore [the saltness to] it? Have salt within yourselves and be at peace and live in harmony with one another.
Mark,10,1,AND [Jesus] left there [Capernaum] and went to the region of Judea and beyond [east of] the Jordan; and crowds [constantly] gathered around Him again and as was His custom He began to teach them again.
Mark,10,2,And some Pharisees came up and in order to test Him and try to find a weakness in Him asked Is it lawful for a man to dismiss and repudiate and divorce his wife?
Mark,10,3,He answered them What did Moses command you?
Mark,10,4,They replied Moses allowed a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away.
Mark,10,5,But Jesus said to them Because of your hardness of heart [ your condition of insensibility to the call of God] he wrote you this precept in your Law.
Mark,10,6,But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
Mark,10,7,For this reason a man shall leave [behind] his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and cleave closely to her permanently
Mark,10,8,And the two shall become one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh.
Mark,10,9,What therefore God has united (joined together) let not man separate or divide.
Mark,10,10,And indoors the disciples questioned Him again about this subject.
Mark,10,11,And He said to them Whoever dismisses (repudiates and divorces) his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;
Mark,10,12,And if a woman dismisses (repudiates and divorces) her husband and marries another she commits adultery.
Mark,10,13,And they kept bringing young children to Him that He might touch them and the disciples were reproving them [for it].
Mark,10,14,But when Jesus saw [it] He was indignant and pained and said to them Allow the children to come to Me--do not forbid or prevent or hinder them--for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
Mark,10,15,Truly I tell you whoever does not receive and accept and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [does] positively shall not enter it at all.
Mark,10,16,And He took them [the children up one by one] in His arms and [ fervently invoked a] blessing placing His hands upon them.
Mark,10,17,And as He was setting out on His journey a man ran up and knelt before Him and asked Him Teacher [You are essentially and perfectly morally] good what must I do to inherit eternal life [that is to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?
Mark,10,18,And Jesus said to him Why do you call Me [ essentially and perfectly morally] good? There is no one [ essentially and perfectly morally] good--except God alone.
Mark,10,19,You know the commandments: Do not kill do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness do not defraud honor your father and mother.
Mark,10,20,And he replied to Him Teacher I have carefully guarded and observed all these and taken care not to violate them from my boyhood.
Mark,10,21,And Jesus looking upon him loved him and He said to him You lack one thing; go and sell all you have and give [the money] to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven; and come [and] accompany Me [ walking the same road that I walk].
Mark,10,22,At that saying the man's countenance fell and was gloomy and he went away grieved and sorrowing for he was holding great possessions.
Mark,10,23,And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples With what difficulty will those who possess wealth and keep on holding it enter the kingdom of God!
Mark,10,24,And the disciples were amazed and bewildered and perplexed at His words. But Jesus said to them again Children how hard it is for those who trust (place their confidence their sense of safety) in riches to enter the kingdom of God!
Mark,10,25,It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
Mark,10,26,And they were shocked and exceedingly astonished and said to Him and to one another Then who can be saved?
Mark,10,27,Jesus glanced around at them and said With men [it is] impossible but not with God; for all things are possible with God.
Mark,10,28,Peter started to say to Him Behold we have yielded up and abandoned everything [once and for all and joined You as Your disciples siding with Your party] and accompanied You [ walking the same road that You walk].
Mark,10,29,Jesus said Truly I tell you there is no one who has given up and left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for My sake and for the Gospel's
Mark,10,30,Who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time--houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions--and in the age to come eternal life.
Mark,10,31,But many [who are now] first will be last [then] and many [who are now] last will be first [then].
Mark,10,32,They were on the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was walking on in front of them; and they were bewildered and perplexed and greatly astonished and those [who were still] following were seized with alarm and were afraid. And He took the Twelve [apostles] again and began to tell them what was about to happen to Him
Mark,10,33,[Saying] Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn and sentence Him to death and turn Him over to the Gentiles.
Mark,10,34,And they will mock Him and spit on Him and whip Him and put Him to death; but after three days He will rise again [ from death].
Mark,10,35,And James and John the sons of Zebedee approached Him and said to Him Teacher we desire You to do for us whatever we ask of You.
Mark,10,36,And He replied to them What do you desire Me to do for you?
Mark,10,37,And they said to Him Grant that we may sit one at Your right hand and one at [Your] left hand in Your glory (Your majesty and splendor).
Mark,10,38,But Jesus said to them You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism [of affliction] with which I am baptized?
Mark,10,39,And they replied to Him We are able. And Jesus told them The cup that I drink you will drink and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized
Mark,10,40,But to sit at My right hand or at My left hand is not Mine to give; but [it will be given to those] for whom it is ordained and prepared.
Mark,10,41,And when the other ten [apostles] heard it they began to be indignant with James and John.
Mark,10,42,But Jesus called them to [Him] and said to them You know that those who are recognized as governing and are supposed to rule the Gentiles (the nations) lord it over them [ruling with absolute power holding them in subjection] and their great men exercise authority and dominion over them.
Mark,10,43,But this is not to be so among you; instead whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant
Mark,10,44,And whoever wishes to be most important and first in rank among you must be slave of all.
Mark,10,45,For even the Son of Man came not to have service rendered to Him but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for ( instead of) many.
Mark,10,46,Then they came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a great crowd Bartimaeus a blind beggar a son of Timaeus was sitting by the roadside.
Mark,10,47,And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to shout saying Jesus Son of David have pity and mercy on me [ now]!
Mark,10,48,And many severely censured and reproved him telling him to keep still but he kept on shouting out all the more You Son of David have pity and mercy on me [now]!
Mark,10,49,And Jesus stopped and said Call him. And they called the blind man telling him Take courage! Get up! He is calling you.
Mark,10,50,And throwing off his outer garment he leaped up and came to Jesus.
Mark,10,51,And Jesus said to him What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him Master let me receive my sight.
Mark,10,52,And Jesus said to him Go your way; your faith has healed you. And at once he received his sight and accompanied Jesus on the road.
Mark,11,1,WHEN THEY were getting near to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives He sent ahead two of His disciples
Mark,11,2,And instructed them Go into the village in front of you and as soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied which has never been ridden by anyone; unfasten it and bring it [here].
Mark,11,3,If anyone asks you Why are you doing this? answer The Lord needs it and He will send it back here presently.
Mark,11,4,So they went away and found a colt tied at the door out in the [winding] open street and they loosed it.
Mark,11,5,And some who were standing there said to them What are you doing untying the colt?
Mark,11,6,And they replied as Jesus had directed them and they allowed them to go.
Mark,11,7,And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their outer garments upon it and He sat on it.
Mark,11,8,And many [of the people] spread their garments on the road and others [scattered a layer of] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.
Mark,11,9,And those who went before and those who followed cried out [ with a cry of happiness] Hosanna! [Be graciously inclined and propitious to Him!] Praised and blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord!
Mark,11,10,Praised and blessed in the name of the Lord is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna (O save us) in the highest [heaven]!
Mark,11,11,And Jesus went into Jerusalem and entered the temple [ enclosure]; and when He had looked around surveying and observing everything as it was already late He went out to Bethany together with the Twelve [apostles].
Mark,11,12,On the day following when they had come away from Bethany He was hungry.
Mark,11,13,And seeing in the distance a fig tree [covered] with leaves He went to see if He could find any [fruit] on it [ for in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves]. But when He came up to it He found nothing but leaves for the fig season had not yet come.
Mark,11,14,And He said to it No one ever again shall eat fruit from you. And His disciples were listening [to what He said].
Mark,11,15,And they came to Jerusalem. And He went into the temple [area the porches and courts] and began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple area and He overturned the [ four-footed] tables of the money changers and the seats of those who dealt in doves;
Mark,11,16,And He would not permit anyone to carry any household equipment through the temple enclosure [thus making the temple area a short-cut traffic lane].
Mark,11,17,And He taught and said to them Is it not written My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have turned it into a den of robbers.
Mark,11,18,And the chief priests and the scribes heard [of this] and kept seeking some way to destroy Him for they feared Him because the entire multitude was struck with astonishment at His teaching.
Mark,11,19,And when evening came on He and His disciples as accustomed went out of the city.
Mark,11,20,In the morning when they were passing along they noticed that the fig tree was withered [completely] away to its roots.
Mark,11,21,And Peter remembered and said to Him Master look! The fig tree which You doomed has withered away!
Mark,11,22,And Jesus replying said to them Have faith in God [constantly].
Mark,11,23,Truly I tell you whoever says to this mountain Be lifted up and thrown into the sea! and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place it will be done for him.
Mark,11,24,For this reason I am telling you whatever you ask for in prayer believe (trust and be confident) that it is granted to you and you will [get it].
Mark,11,25,And whenever you stand praying if you have anything against anyone forgive him and let it drop (leave it let it go) in order that your Father Who is in heaven may also forgive you your [own] failings and shortcomings and let them drop.
Mark,11,26,But if you do not forgive neither will your Father in heaven forgive your failings and shortcomings.
Mark,11,27,And they came again to Jerusalem. And when Jesus was walking about in the [ courts and porches of the] temple the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him
Mark,11,28,And they kept saying to Him By what [sort of] authority are You doing these things or who gave You this authority to do them?
Mark,11,29,Jesus told them I will ask you a question. Answer Me and then I will tell you by what [sort of] authority I do these things.
Mark,11,30,Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer Me.
Mark,11,31,And they reasoned and argued with one another If we say From heaven He will say Why then did you not believe him?
Mark,11,32,But [on the other hand] can we say From men? For they were afraid of the people because everybody considered and held John actually to be a prophet.
Mark,11,33,So they replied to Jesus We do not know. And Jesus said to them Neither am I going to tell you what [sort of] authority I have for doing these things.
Mark,12,1,AND [Jesus] started to speak to them in parables [with comparisons and illustrations]. A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower and let it out [for rent] to vinedressers and went into another country.
Mark,12,2,When the season came he sent a bond servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
Mark,12,3,But they took him and beat him and sent him away without anything.
Mark,12,4,Again he sent to them another bond servant and they stoned him and wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully [sending him away with insults].
Mark,12,5,And he sent another and that one they killed; then many others--some they beat and some they put to death.
Mark,12,6,He had still one left [to send] a beloved son; last of all he sent him to them saying They will respect my son.
Mark,12,7,But those tenants said to one another Here is the heir; come on let us put him to death and [then] the inheritance will be ours.
Mark,12,8,And they took him and killed him and threw [his body] outside the vineyard.
Mark,12,9,Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.
Mark,12,10,Have you not even read this [passage of] Scripture: The very Stone which [ after putting It to the test] the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner [Cornerstone];
Mark,12,11,This is from the Lord and is His doing and it is marvelous in our eyes?
Mark,12,12,And they were trying to get hold of Him but they were afraid of the people for they knew that He spoke this parable with reference to and against them. So they left Him and departed.
Mark,12,13,But they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him for the purpose of entrapping Him in His speech.
Mark,12,14,And they came up and said to Him Teacher we know that You are sincere and what You profess to be that You cannot lie and that You have no personal bias for anyone; for You are not influenced by partiality and have no regard for anyone's external condition or position but in [and on the basis of] truth You teach the way of God. Is it lawful (permissible and right) to give tribute ( poll taxes) to Caesar or not?
Mark,12,15,Should we pay [them] or should we not pay [them]? But knowing their hypocrisy He asked them Why do you put Me to the test? Bring Me a coin (a denarius) so I may see it.
Mark,12,16,And they brought [Him one]. Then He asked them Whose image (picture) is this? And whose superscription ( title)? They said to Him Caesar's.
Mark,12,17,Jesus said to them Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's. And they stood marveling and greatly amazed at Him.
Mark,12,18,And [some] Sadducees came to Him [of that party] who say there is no resurrection and they asked Him a question saying
Mark,12,19,Teacher Moses gave us [a law] that if a man's brother died leaving a wife but no child the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
Mark,12,20,Now there were seven brothers; the first one took a wife and died leaving no children.
Mark,12,21,And the second [brother] married her and died leaving no children; and the third did the same;
Mark,12,22,And all seven leaving no children. Last of all the woman died also.
Mark,12,23,Now in the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven were married to her.
Mark,12,24,Jesus said to them Is not this where you wander out of the way and go wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?
Mark,12,25,For when they arise from among the dead [men] do not marry nor are [women] given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.
Mark,12,26,But concerning the dead being raised--have you not read in the book of Moses [in the passage] about the [burning] bush how God said to him I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?
Mark,12,27,He is not the God of [the] dead but of [the] living! You are very wrong.
Mark,12,28,Then one of the scribes came up and listened to them disputing with one another and noticing that Jesus answered them fitly and admirably he asked Him Which commandment is first and most important of all [ in its nature]?
Mark,12,29,Jesus answered The first and principal one of all commands is: Hear O Israel The Lord our God is one Lord;
Mark,12,30,And you shall love the Lord your God out of and with your whole heart and out of and with all your soul (your life) and out of and with all your mind (with your faculty of thought and your moral understanding) and out of and with all your strength. This is the first and principal commandment.
Mark,12,31,The second is like it and is this You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
Mark,12,32,And the scribe said to Him Excellently and fitly and admirably answered Teacher! You have said truly that He is One and there is no other but Him;
Mark,12,33,And to love Him out of and with all the heart and with all the understanding [with the faculty of quick apprehension and intelligence and keenness of discernment] and with all the strength and to love one's neighbor as oneself is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. [I Sam. 15:22; Hos. 6:6; Mic. 6:6-8; Heb. 10:8.]
Mark,12,34,And when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently (discreetly and having his wits about him) He said to him You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one ventured or dared to ask Him any further question.
Mark,12,35,And as Jesus taught in [a porch or court of] the temple He said How can the scribes say that the Christ is David's Son?
Mark,12,36,David himself [inspired] in the Holy Spirit declared The Lord said to my Lord Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies [a footstool] under Your feet.
Mark,12,37,David himself calls Him Lord; so how can it be that He is his Son? Now the great mass of the people heard [Jesus] gladly [listening to Him with delight].
Mark,12,38,And in [the course of] His teaching He said Beware of the scribes who like to go around in long robes and [to get] greetings in the marketplaces [public forums]
Mark,12,39,And [have] the front seats in the synagogues and the chief couches (places of honor) at feasts
Mark,12,40,Who devour widows' houses and to cover it up make long prayers. They will receive the heavier [sentence of] condemnation.
Mark,12,41,And He sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury. Many rich [people] were throwing in large sums.
Mark,12,42,And a widow who was poverty-stricken came and put in two copper mites [the smallest of coins] which together make half of a cent.
Mark,12,43,And He called His disciples [to Him] and said to them Truly and surely I tell you this widow [she who is] poverty-stricken has put in more than all those contributing to the treasury.
Mark,12,44,For they all threw in out of their abundance; but she out of her deep poverty has put in everything that she had--[even] all she had on which to live.
Mark,13,1,AND AS [Jesus] was coming out of the temple [ area] one of His disciples said to Him Look Teacher! Notice the sort and quality of these stones and buildings!
Mark,13,2,And Jesus replied to him You see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be loosened and torn down.
Mark,13,3,And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple [ enclosure] Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately
Mark,13,4,Tell us when is this to take place and what will be the sign when these things all [of them] are about to be accomplished?
Mark,13,5,And Jesus began to tell them Be careful and watchful that no one misleads you [about it].
Mark,13,6,Many will come in [ appropriating to themselves] the name [of Messiah] which belongs to Me [ basing their claims on the use of My name] saying I am [He]! And they will mislead many.
Mark,13,7,And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not get alarmed (troubled and frightened); it is necessary [that these things] take place but the end is not yet.
Mark,13,8,For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines and calamities. This is but the beginning of the intolerable anguish and suffering [only the first of the birth pangs].
Mark,13,9,But look to yourselves; for they will turn you over to councils and you will be beaten in the synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them.
Mark,13,10,And the good news (the Gospel) must first be preached to all nations.
Mark,13,11,Now when they take you [to court] and put you under arrest do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say nor [even ] meditate about it; but say whatever is given you in that hour and at the moment for it is not you who will be speaking but the Holy Spirit.
Mark,13,12,And brother will hand over brother to death and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and [have] them put to death.
Mark,13,13,And you will be hated and detested by everybody for My name's sake but he who patiently perseveres and endures to the end will be saved ( made a partaker of the salvation by Christ and delivered from spiritual death).
Mark,13,14,But when you see the abomination of desolation mentioned by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not to be--[and] let the one who reads take notice and consider and understand and heed [this]--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Mark,13,15,Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house nor go inside to take anything out of his house;
Mark,13,16,And let him who is in the field not turn back again to get his mantle (cloak).
Mark,13,17,And alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days!
Mark,13,18,Pray that it may not occur in winter
Mark,13,19,For at that time there will be such affliction (oppression and tribulation) as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until this particular time--and positively never will be [again].
Mark,13,20,And unless the Lord had shortened the days no human being would be saved (rescued); but for the sake of the elect His chosen ones (those whom He picked out for Himself) He has shortened the days.
Mark,13,21,And then if anyone says to you See here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or Look there He is! do not believe it.
Mark,13,22,False Christs (Messiahs) and false prophets will arise and show signs and [work] miracles to deceive and lead astray if possible even the elect (those God has chosen out for Himself).
Mark,13,23,But look to yourselves and be on your guard; I have told you everything beforehand.
Mark,13,24,But in those days after [the affliction and oppression and distress of] that tribulation the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light;
Mark,13,25,And the stars will be falling from the sky and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
Mark,13,26,And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great (kingly) power and glory (majesty and splendor).
Mark,13,27,And then He will send out the angels and will gather together His elect (those He has picked out for Himself) from the four winds from the farthest bounds of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven.
Mark,13,28,Now learn a lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves you recognize and know that summer is near.
Mark,13,29,So also when you see these things happening you may recognize and know that He is near at [the very] door.
Mark,13,30,Surely I say to you this generation ( the whole multitude of people living at that one time) positively will not perish or pass away before all these things take place.
Mark,13,31,Heaven and earth will perish and pass away but My words will not perish or pass away.
Mark,13,32,But of that day or that hour not a [single] person knows not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father.
Mark,13,33,Be on your guard [constantly alert] and watch and pray; for you do not know when the time will come.
Mark,13,34,It is like a man [ already] going on a journey; when he leaves home he puts his servants in charge each with his particular task and he gives orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on the watch.
Mark,13,35,Therefore watch (give strict attention be cautious and alert) for you do not know when the Master of the house is coming--in the evening or at midnight or at cockcrowing or in the morning--
Mark,13,36,[Watch I say] lest He come suddenly and unexpectedly and find you asleep.
Mark,13,37,And what I say to you I say to everybody: Watch (give strict attention be cautious active and alert)!
Mark,14,1,IT WAS now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the chief priests and the scribes were all the while seeking to arrest [Jesus] by secrecy and deceit and put [Him] to death
Mark,14,2,For they kept saying It must not be during the Feast for fear that there might be a riot of the people.
Mark,14,3,And while He was in Bethany [a guest] in the house of Simon the leper as He was reclining [at table] a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment ( perfume) of pure nard very costly and precious; and she broke the jar and poured [the perfume] over His head.
Mark,14,4,But there were some who were moved with indignation and said to themselves To what purpose was the ointment ( perfume) thus wasted?
Mark,14,5,For it was possible to have sold this [perfume] for more than 300 denarii [a laboring man's wages for a year] and to have given [the money] to the poor. And they censured and reproved her.
Mark,14,6,But Jesus said Let her alone; why are you troubling her? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me [praiseworthy and noble].
Mark,14,7,For you always have the poor with you and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have Me.
Mark,14,8,She has done what she could; she came beforehand to anoint My body for the burial.
Mark,14,9,And surely I tell you wherever the good news (the Gospel) is proclaimed in the entire world what she has done will be told in memory of her.
Mark,14,10,Then Judas Iscariot who was one of the Twelve [apostles] went off to the chief priests in order to betray and hand Him over to them.
Mark,14,11,And when they heard it they rejoiced and were delighted and they promised to give him money. And he [busying himself continually] sought an opportunity to betray Him.
Mark,14,12,On the first day [of the Feast] of Unleavened Bread when [as was customary] they killed the Passover lamb [Jesus'] disciples said to Him Where do You wish us to go [and] prepare the Passover [supper] for You to eat?
Mark,14,13,And He sent two of His disciples and said to them Go into the city and a man carrying an [earthen] jar or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him.
Mark,14,14,And whatever [house] he enters say to the master of the house The Teacher says: Where is My guest room where I may eat the Passover [supper] with My disciples?
Mark,14,15,And he will [himself] show you a large upper room furnished [with carpets and with dining couches properly spread] and ready; there prepare for us.
Mark,14,16,Then the disciples set out and came to the city and found [everything] just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
Mark,14,17,And when it was evening He came with the Twelve [apostles].
Mark,14,18,And while they were at the table eating Jesus said Surely I say to you one of you will betray Me [one] who is eating [here] with Me.
Mark,14,19,And they began to show that they were sad and hurt and to say to Him one after another Is it I? or It is not I is it?
Mark,14,20,He replied to them It is one of the Twelve [apostles] one who is dipping [bread] into the [same deep] dish with Me.
Mark,14,21,For the Son of Man is going as it stands written concerning Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good (profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born.
Mark,14,22,And while they were eating He took a loaf [of bread] praised God and gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use. [Then] He broke [it] and gave to them and said Take. Eat. This is My body.
Mark,14,23,He also took a cup [of the juice of grapes] and when He had given thanks He gave [it] to them and they all drank of it.
Mark,14,24,And He said to them This is My blood [which ratifies] the new covenant [the blood] which is being poured out for (on account of) many.
Mark,14,25,Solemnly and surely I tell you I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it of a new and a higher quality in God's kingdom.
Mark,14,26,And when they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Mark,14,27,And Jesus said to them You will all fall away this night [that is you will be caused to stumble and will begin to distrust and desert Me] for it stands written I will strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.
Mark,14,28,But after I am raised [to life] I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark,14,29,But Peter said to Him Even if they all fall away and are caused to stumble and distrust and desert You yet I will not [do so]!
Mark,14,30,And Jesus said to him Truly I tell you this very night before a cock crows twice you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times.
Mark,14,31,But [Peter] said more vehemently and repeatedly [Even] if it should be necessary for me to die with You I will not deny or disown You! And they all kept saying the same thing.
Mark,14,32,Then they went to a place called Gethsemane and He said to His disciples Sit down here while I pray.
Mark,14,33,And He took with Him Peter and James and John and began to be struck with terror and amazement and deeply troubled and depressed.
Mark,14,34,And He said to them My soul is exceedingly sad (overwhelmed with grief) so that it almost kills Me! Remain here and keep awake and be watching.
Mark,14,35,And going a little farther He fell on the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the [ fatal] hour might pass from Him.
Mark,14,36,And He was saying Abba [which means] Father everything is possible for You. Take away this cup from Me; yet not what I will but what You [will].
Mark,14,37,And He came back and found them sleeping and He said to Peter Simon are you asleep? Have you not the strength to keep awake and watch [with Me for] one hour?
Mark,14,38,Keep awake and watch and pray [constantly] that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.
Mark,14,39,He went away again and prayed saying the same words.
Mark,14,40,And again He came back and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what answer to give Him.
Mark,14,41,And He came back a third time and said to them Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough [of that]! The hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinful men (men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God).
Mark,14,42,Get up let us be going! See My betrayer is at hand!
Mark,14,43,And at once while He was still speaking Judas came one of the Twelve [apostles] and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs [who came] from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders [of the Sanhedrin].
Mark,14,44,Now the betrayer had given them a signal saying The One I shall kiss is [the Man]; seize Him and lead [Him] away safely [so as to prevent His escape].
Mark,14,45,And when he came he went up to Jesus immediately and said Master! Master! and he embraced Him and kissed Him fervently.
Mark,14,46,And they threw their hands on Him and arrested Him.
Mark,14,47,But one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Mark,14,48,And Jesus said to them Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me?
Mark,14,49,I was with you daily in the temple [ porches and courts] teaching and you did not seize Me; but [this has happened] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.
Mark,14,50,Then [His disciples] forsaking Him fled all [of them].
Mark,14,51,And a young man was following Him with nothing but a linen cloth ( sheet) thrown about [his] naked [body]; and they laid hold of him
Mark,14,52,But leaving behind the linen cloth ( sheet) he fled from them naked.
Mark,14,53,And they led Jesus away to the high priest and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were gathered together.
Mark,14,54,And Peter followed Him at a distance even right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting [ in the firelight] with the guards and warming himself at the fire.
Mark,14,55,Now the chief priests and the entire council (the Sanhedrin) were constantly seeking [to get] testimony against Jesus with a view to condemning Him and putting Him to death but they did not find any.
Mark,14,56,For many were repeatedly bearing false witness against Him but their testimonies did not agree.
Mark,14,57,And some stood up and were bearing false witness against Him saying
Mark,14,58,We heard Him say I will destroy this temple (sanctuary) which is made with hands and in three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark,14,59,Still not even [in this] did their testimony agree.
Mark,14,60,And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus Have You not even one answer to make? What [about this which] these [men] are testifying against You?
Mark,14,61,But He kept still and did not answer at all. Again the high priest asked Him Are You the Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) the Son of the Blessed?
Mark,14,62,And Jesus said I AM; and you will [all] see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power ( the Almighty) and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Mark,14,63,Then the high priest tore his garments and said What need have we for more witnesses?
Mark,14,64,You have heard His blasphemy. What is your decision? And they all condemned Him as being guilty and deserving of death.
Mark,14,65,And some of them began to spit on Him and to blindfold Him and to strike Him with their fists saying to Him Prophesy! And the guards received Him with blows and by slapping Him.
Mark,14,66,While Peter was down below in the courtyard one of the [serving] maids of the high priest came;
Mark,14,67,And when she saw Peter warming himself she gazed intently at him and said You were with Jesus of Nazareth too.
Mark,14,68,But he denied it falsely and disowned Him saying I neither know nor understand what you say. Then he went outside [the courtyard and was] into the vestibule. And a cock crowed.
Mark,14,69,And the maidservant saw him and began again to say to the bystanders This [man] is [one] of them.
Mark,14,70,But again he denied it falsely and disowned Him. And after a short while again the bystanders said to Peter Really you are one of them for you are a Galilean and your dialect shows it.
Mark,14,71,Then he commenced invoking a curse on himself [should he not be telling the truth] and swearing I do not know the Man about Whom you are talking!
Mark,14,72,And at once for the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered how Jesus said to him Before a cock crows twice you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times. And having put his thought upon it [and remembering] he broke down and wept aloud and lamented.
Mark,15,1,AND IMMEDIATELY when it was morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole council held a consultation; and when they had bound Jesus they took Him away [ violently] and handed Him over to Pilate.
Mark,15,2,And Pilate inquired of Him Are You the King of the Jews? And He replied It is as you say.
Mark,15,3,And the chief priests kept accusing Him of many things.
Mark,15,4,And Pilate again asked Him Have You no answer to make? See how many charges they are bringing against You!
Mark,15,5,But Jesus made no further answer at all so that Pilate wondered and marveled.
Mark,15,6,Now at the Feast he [was accustomed to] set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested.
Mark,15,7,And among the rioters in the prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man named Barabbas.
Mark,15,8,And the throng came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
Mark,15,9,And he replied to them Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews?
Mark,15,10,For he was aware that it was [ because they were prompted] by envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up.
Mark,15,11,But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release for them Barabbas instead.
Mark,15,12,And again Pilate said to them Then what shall I do with the Man Whom you call the King of the Jews?
Mark,15,13,And they shouted back again Crucify Him!
Mark,15,14,But Pilate said to them Why? What has He done that is evil? But they shouted with all their might all the more Crucify Him [ at once]!
Mark,15,15,So Pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd set Barabbas free for them; and after having Jesus whipped he handed [Him] over to be crucified.
Mark,15,16,Then the soldiers led Him away to the courtyard inside the palace that is the Praetorium and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together.
Mark,15,17,And they dressed Him in [a] purple [robe] and weaving together a crown of thorns they placed it on Him.
Mark,15,18,And they began to salute Him Hail (greetings good health to You long life to You) King of the Jews!
Mark,15,19,And they struck His head with a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and spat on Him and kept bowing their knees in homage to Him.
Mark,15,20,And when they had [finished] making sport of Him they took the purple [robe] off of Him and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out [of the city] to crucify Him.
Mark,15,21,And they forced a passerby Simon of Cyrene the father of Alexander and Rufus who was coming in from the field (country) to carry His cross.
Mark,15,22,And they led Him to Golgotha [in Latin: Calvary] meaning The Place of a Skull.
Mark,15,23,And they [attempted to] give Him wine mingled with myrrh but He would not take it.
Mark,15,24,And they crucified Him; and they divided His garments and distributed them among themselves throwing lots for them to decide who should take what.
Mark,15,25,And it was the third hour (about nine o'clock in the morning) when they crucified Him.
Mark,15,26,And the inscription of the accusation against Him was written above The King of the Jews.
Mark,15,27,And with Him they crucified two robbers one on [His] right hand and one on His left.
Mark,15,28,And the Scripture was fulfilled which says He was counted among the transgressors.
Mark,15,29,And those who passed by kept reviling Him and reproaching Him abusively in harsh and insolent language wagging their heads and saying Aha! You Who would destroy the temple and build it in three days
Mark,15,30,Now rescue Yourself [ from death] coming down from the cross!
Mark,15,31,So also the chief priests with the scribes made sport of Him to one another saying He rescued others [ from death]; Himself He is unable to rescue.
Mark,15,32,Let the Christ (the Messiah) the King of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see [it] and trust in and rely on Him and adhere to Him! Those who were crucified with Him also reviled and reproached Him [speaking abusively harshly and insolently].
Mark,15,33,And when the sixth hour (about midday) had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour (about three o'clock).
Mark,15,34,And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani?--which means My God My God why have You forsaken Me [ deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned]?
Mark,15,35,And some of those standing by [and] hearing it said See! He is calling Elijah!
Mark,15,36,And one man ran and filling a sponge with vinegar (a mixture of sour wine and water) put it on a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and gave it to Him to drink saying Hold off! Let us see whether Elijah [does] come to take Him down.
Mark,15,37,And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed out His life.
Mark,15,38,And the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
Mark,15,39,And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way he said Really this Man was God's Son!
Mark,15,40,Now some women were there also looking on from a distance among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses and Salome
Mark,15,41,Who when [Jesus] was in Galilee were in the habit of accompanying and ministering to Him; and [there were] also many other [women] who had come up with Him to Jerusalem.
Mark,15,42,As evening had already come since it was the day of Preparation that is [the day] before the Sabbath
Mark,15,43,Joseph he of Arimathea noble and honorable in rank and a respected member of the council (Sanhedrin) who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God daring the consequences took courage and ventured to go to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark,15,44,But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon and having called the centurion he asked him whether [Jesus] was already dead.
Mark,15,45,And when he learned from the centurion [that He was indeed dead] he gave the body to Joseph.
Mark,15,46,And Joseph bought a [fine] linen cloth [ for swathing dead bodies] and taking Him down from the cross he rolled Him up in the [fine] linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock. Then he rolled a [very large] stone against the door of the tomb.
Mark,15,47,And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were [ attentively] observing where He was laid.
Mark,16,1,AND WHEN the Sabbath was past [that is after the sun had set] Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of James and Salome purchased sweet-smelling spices so that they might go and anoint [Jesus' body].
Mark,16,2,And very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb; [by then] the sun had risen.
Mark,16,3,And they said to one another Who will roll back the stone for us out of [the groove across the floor at] the door of the tomb?
Mark,16,4,And when they looked up they [distinctly] saw that the stone was already rolled back for it was very large.
Mark,16,5,And going into the tomb they saw a young man sitting [there] on the right [side] clothed in a [ long stately sweeping] robe of white and they were utterly amazed and struck with terror.
Mark,16,6,And he said to them Do not be amazed and terrified; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth Who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.
Mark,16,7,But be going; tell the disciples and Peter He goes before you into Galilee; you will see Him there [just] as He told you.
Mark,16,8,Then they went out [and] fled from the tomb for trembling and bewilderment and consternation had seized them. And they said nothing about it to anyone for they were held by alarm and fear.
Mark,16,9,Now Jesus having risen [ from death] early on the first day of the week appeared first to Mary Magdalene from whom He had driven out seven demons.
Mark,16,10,She went and reported it to those who had been with Him as they grieved and wept.
Mark,16,11,And when they heard that He was alive and that she had seen Him they did not believe it.
Mark,16,12,After this He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking [along the way] into the country.
Mark,16,13,And they returned [to Jerusalem] and told the others but they did not believe them either.
Mark,16,14,Afterward He appeared to the Eleven [apostles themselves] as they reclined at table; and He reproved and reproached them for their unbelief (their lack of faith) and their hardness of heart because they had refused to believe those who had seen Him and looked at Him attentively after He had risen [ from death].
Mark,16,15,And He said to them Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news (the Gospel) to every creature [of the whole human race].
Mark,16,16,He who believes [who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] and is baptized will be saved [ from the penalty of eternal death]; but he who does not believe [who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] will be condemned.
Mark,16,17,And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;
Mark,16,18,They will pick up serpents; and [even] if they drink anything deadly it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick and they will get well.
Mark,16,19,So then the Lord Jesus after He had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and He sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark,16,20,And they went out and preached everywhere while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the attesting signs and miracles that closely accompanied [it]. Amen (so be it).
Luke,1,1,SINCE [ as is well known] many have undertaken to put in order and draw up a [ thorough] narrative of the surely established deeds which have been accomplished and fulfilled in and among us
Luke,1,2,Exactly as they were handed down to us by those who from the [ official] beginning [of Jesus' ministry] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word [that is of the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God]
Luke,1,3,It seemed good and desirable to me [and so I have determined] also after having searched out diligently and followed all things closely and traced accurately the course from the highest to the minutest detail from the very first to write an orderly account for you most excellent Theophilus
Luke,1,4,[My purpose is] that you may know the full truth and understand with certainty and security against error the accounts (histories) and doctrines of the faith of which you have been informed and in which you have been orally instructed.
Luke,1,5,In the days when Herod was king of Judea there was a certain priest whose name was Zachariah of the daily service (the division) of Abia; and his wife was also a descendant of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth.
Luke,1,6,And they both were righteous in the sight of God walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.
Luke,1,7,But they had no child for Elizabeth was barren; and both were far advanced in years.
Luke,1,8,Now while on duty serving as priest before God in the order of his division
Luke,1,9,As was the custom of the priesthood it fell to him by lot to enter [the sanctuary of] the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
Luke,1,10,And all the throng of people were praying outside [in the court] at the hour of incense [burning].
Luke,1,11,And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
Luke,1,12,And when Zachariah saw him he was troubled and fear took possession of him.
Luke,1,13,But the angel said to him Do not be afraid Zachariah because your petition was heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you must call his name John [God is favorable].
Luke,1,14,And you shall have joy and exultant delight and many will rejoice over his birth
Luke,1,15,For he will be great and distinguished in the sight of the Lord. And he must drink no wine nor strong drink and he will be filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit even in and from his mother's womb.
Luke,1,16,And he will turn back and cause to return many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God
Luke,1,17,And he will [himself] go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient and incredulous and unpersuadable to the wisdom of the upright [which is the knowledge and holy love of the will of God]--in order to make ready for the Lord a people [perfectly] prepared [in spirit adjusted and disposed and placed in the right moral state].
Luke,1,18,And Zachariah said to the angel By what shall I know and be sure of this? For I am an old man and my wife is well advanced in years.
Luke,1,19,And the angel replied to him I am Gabriel. I stand in the [very] presence of God and I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news.
Luke,1,20,Now behold you will be and will continue to be silent and not able to speak till the day when these things take place because you have not believed what I told you; but my words are of a kind which will be fulfilled in the appointed and proper time.
Luke,1,21,Now the people kept waiting for Zachariah and they wondered at his delaying [so long] in the sanctuary.
Luke,1,22,But when he did come out he was unable to speak to them; and they [ clearly] perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; and he kept making signs to them still he remained dumb.
Luke,1,23,And when his time of performing priestly functions was ended he returned to his [own] house.
Luke,1,24,Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months she secluded herself entirely saying [I have hid myself]
Luke,1,25,Because thus the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He deigned to look on me to take away my reproach among men.
Luke,1,26,Now in the sixth month [after that] the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth
Luke,1,27,To a girl never having been married and a virgin engaged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph a descendant of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
Luke,1,28,And he came to her and said Hail O favored one [ endued with grace]! The Lord is with you! Blessed (favored of God) are you before all other women!
Luke,1,29,But when she saw him she was greatly troubled and disturbed and confused at what he said and kept revolving in her mind what such a greeting might mean.
Luke,1,30,And the angel said to her Do not be afraid Mary for you have found grace ( free spontaneous absolute favor and loving-kindness) with God.
Luke,1,31,And listen! You will become pregnant and will give birth to a Son and you shall call His name Jesus.
Luke,1,32,He will be great (eminent) and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His forefather David
Luke,1,33,And He will reign over the house of Jacob throughout the ages; and of His reign there will be no end.
Luke,1,34,And Mary said to the angel How can this be since I have no [intimacy with any man as a] husband?
Luke,1,35,Then the angel said to her The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [like a shining cloud]; and so the holy (pure sinless) Thing (Offspring) which shall be born of you will be called the Son of God.
Luke,1,36,And listen! Your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is now the sixth month with her who was called barren.
Luke,1,37,For with God nothing is ever impossible and no word from God shall be without power or impossible of fulfillment.
Luke,1,38,Then Mary said Behold I am the handmaiden of the Lord; let it be done to me according to what you have said. And the angel left her.
Luke,1,39,And at that time Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country to a town of Judah
Luke,1,40,And she went to the house of Zachariah and entering it saluted Elizabeth.
Luke,1,41,And it occurred that when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit.
Luke,1,42,And she cried out with a loud cry and then exclaimed Blessed (favored of God) above all other women are you! And blessed (favored of God) is the Fruit of your womb!
Luke,1,43,And how [have I deserved that this honor should] be granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
Luke,1,44,For behold the instant the sound of your salutation reached my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
Luke,1,45,And blessed (happy to be envied) is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from the Lord.
Luke,1,46,And Mary said My soul magnifies and extols the Lord
Luke,1,47,And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
Luke,1,48,For He has looked upon the low station and humiliation of His handmaiden. For behold from now on all generations [of all ages] will call me blessed and declare me happy and to be envied!
Luke,1,49,For He Who is almighty has done great things for me--and holy is His name [to be venerated in His purity majesty and glory]!
Luke,1,50,And His mercy (His compassion and kindness toward the miserable and afflicted) is on those who fear Him with godly reverence from generation to generation and age to age.
Luke,1,51,He has shown strength and made might with His arm; He has scattered the proud and haughty in and by the imagination and purpose and designs of their hearts.
Luke,1,52,He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree.
Luke,1,53,He has filled and satisfied the hungry with good things and the rich He has sent away empty-handed [without a gift].
Luke,1,54,He has laid hold on His servant Israel [to help him to espouse his cause] in remembrance of His mercy
Luke,1,55,Even as He promised to our forefathers to Abraham and to his descendants forever.
Luke,1,56,And Mary remained with her [Elizabeth] for about three months and [then] returned to her [own] home.
Luke,1,57,Now the time that Elizabeth should be delivered came and she gave birth to a son.
Luke,1,58,And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy on her and they rejoiced with her.
Luke,1,59,And it occurred that on the eighth day when they came to circumcise the child they were intending to call him Zachariah after his father
Luke,1,60,But his mother answered Not so! But he shall be called John.
Luke,1,61,And they said to her None of your relatives is called by that name.
Luke,1,62,And they inquired with signs to his father [as to] what he wanted to have him called.
Luke,1,63,Then Zachariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote His name is John. And they were all astonished.
Luke,1,64,And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he began to speak blessing and praising and thanking God.
Luke,1,65,And awe and reverential fear came on all their neighbors; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea.
Luke,1,66,And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts saying Whatever will this little boy be then? For the hand of the Lord was [ so evidently] with him [protecting and aiding him].
Luke,1,67,Now Zachariah his father was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit and prophesied saying
Luke,1,68,Blessed (praised and extolled and thanked) be the Lord the God of Israel because He has come and brought deliverance and redemption to His people!
Luke,1,69,And He has raised up a Horn of salvation [a mighty and valiant Helper the Author of salvation] for us in the house of David His servant--
Luke,1,70,This is as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times [in the memory of man]--
Luke,1,71,That we should have deliverance and be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who detest and pursue us with hatred;
Luke,1,72,To make true and show the mercy and compassion and kindness [promised] to our forefathers and to remember and carry out His holy covenant [to bless which is all the more sacred because it is made by God Himself]
Luke,1,73,That covenant He sealed by oath to our forefather Abraham:
Luke,1,74,To grant us that we being delivered from the hand of our foes might serve Him fearlessly
Luke,1,75,In holiness (divine consecration) and righteousness [in accordance with the everlasting principles of right] within His presence all the days of our lives.
Luke,1,76,And you little one shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go on before the face of the Lord to make ready His ways
Luke,1,77,To bring and give the knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness and remission of their sins.
Luke,1,78,Because of and through the heart of tender mercy and loving-kindness of our God a Light from on high will dawn upon us and visit [us]
Luke,1,79,To shine upon and give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to direct and guide our feet in a straight line into the way of peace.
Luke,1,80,And the little boy grew and became strong in spirit; and he was in the deserts (wilderness) until the day of his appearing to Israel [the commencement of his public ministry].
Luke,2,1,IN THOSE days it occurred that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole Roman empire should be registered.
Luke,2,2,This was the first enrollment and it was made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke,2,3,And all the people were going to be registered each to his own city or town.
Luke,2,4,And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea to the town of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and family of David
Luke,2,5,To be enrolled with Mary his espoused ( married) wife who was about to become a mother.
Luke,2,6,And while they were there the time came for her delivery
Luke,2,7,And she gave birth to her Son her Firstborn; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger because there was no room or place for them in the inn.
Luke,2,8,And in that vicinity there were shepherds living [out under the open sky] in the field watching [in shifts] over their flock by night.
Luke,2,9,And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them and the glory of the Lord flashed and shone all about them and they were terribly frightened.
Luke,2,10,But the angel said to them Do not be afraid; for behold I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people.
Luke,2,11,For to you is born this day in the town of David a Savior Who is Christ (the Messiah) the Lord!
Luke,2,12,And this will be a sign for you [by which you will recognize Him]: you will find [ after searching] a Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. [I Sam. 2:34; II Kings 19:29; Isa. 7:14.]
Luke,2,13,Then suddenly there appeared with the angel an army of the troops of heaven ( a heavenly knighthood) praising God and saying
Luke,2,14,Glory to God in the highest [heaven] and on earth peace among men with whom He is well pleased [ men of goodwill of His favor].
Luke,2,15,When the angels went away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing ( saying) that has come to pass which the Lord has made known to us.
Luke,2,16,So they went with haste and [ by searching] found Mary and Joseph and the Baby lying in a manger.
Luke,2,17,And when they saw it they made known what had been told them concerning this Child
Luke,2,18,And all who heard it were astounded and marveled at what the shepherds told them.
Luke,2,19,But Mary was keeping within herself all these things ( sayings) weighing and pondering them in her heart.
Luke,2,20,And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen just as it had been told them.
Luke,2,21,And at the end of eight days when [the Baby] was to be circumcised He was called Jesus the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
Luke,2,22,And when the time for their purification [the mother's purification and the Baby's dedication] came according to the Law of Moses they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord--
Luke,2,23,As it is written in the Law of the Lord Every [firstborn] male that opens the womb shall be set apart and dedicated and called holy to the Lord--
Luke,2,24,And [they came also] to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord: a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.
Luke,2,25,Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and this man was righteous and devout [cautiously and carefully observing the divine Law] and looking for the Consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke,2,26,And it had been divinely revealed (communicated) to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Luke,2,27,And prompted by the [Holy] Spirit he came into the temple [ enclosure]; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus to do for Him what was customary according to the Law
Luke,2,28,[Simeon] took Him up in his arms and praised and thanked God and said
Luke,2,29,And now Lord You are releasing Your servant to depart (leave this world) in peace according to Your word.
Luke,2,30,For with my [own] eyes I have seen Your Salvation
Luke,2,31,Which You have ordained and prepared before (in the presence of) all peoples
Luke,2,32,A Light for revelation to the Gentiles [to disclose what was before unknown] and [to bring] praise and honor and glory to Your people Israel.
Luke,2,33,And His [legal] father and [His] mother were marveling at what was said about Him.
Luke,2,34,And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother Behold this Child is appointed and destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against--
Luke,2,35,And a sword will pierce through your own soul also--that the secret thoughts and purposes of many hearts may be brought out and disclosed.
Luke,2,36,And there was also a prophetess Anna the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher. She was very old having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood
Luke,2,37,And as a widow even for eighty-four years. She did not go out from the temple enclosure but was worshiping night and day with fasting and prayer.
Luke,2,38,And she too came up at that same hour and she returned thanks to God and talked of [Jesus] to all who were looking for the redemption (deliverance) of Jerusalem.
Luke,2,39,And when they had done everything according to the Law of the Lord they went back into Galilee to their own town Nazareth.
Luke,2,40,And the Child grew and became strong in spirit filled with wisdom; and the grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of God was upon Him.
Luke,2,41,Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year to the Passover Feast.
Luke,2,42,And when He was twelve years [old] they went up as was their custom.
Luke,2,43,And when the Feast was ended as they were returning the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. Now His parents did not know this
Luke,2,44,But supposing Him to be in the caravan they traveled on a day's journey; and [then] they sought Him [diligently looking up and down for Him] among their kinsfolk and acquaintances.
Luke,2,45,And when they failed to find Him they went back to Jerusalem looking for Him [up and down] all the way.
Luke,2,46,After three days they found Him [came upon Him] in the [court of the] temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions.
Luke,2,47,And all who heard Him were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His intelligence and understanding and His replies.
Luke,2,48,And when they [Joseph and Mary] saw Him they were amazed; and His mother said to Him Child why have You treated us like this? Here Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You [distressed and tormented].
Luke,2,49,And He said to them How is it that you had to look for Me? Did you not see and know that it is necessary [as a duty] for Me to be in My Father's house and [occupied] about My Father's business?
Luke,2,50,But they did not comprehend what He was saying to them.
Luke,2,51,And He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was [habitually] obedient to them; and his mother kept and closely and persistently guarded all these things in her heart.
Luke,2,52,And Jesus increased in wisdom (in broad and full understanding) and in stature and years and in favor with God and man.
Luke,3,1,IN THE fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--
Luke,3,2,In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] came to John son of Zachariah in the wilderness (desert).
Luke,3,3,And he went into all the country round about the Jordan preaching a baptism of repentance ( of hearty amending of their ways with abhorrence of past wrongdoing) unto the forgiveness of sin.
Luke,3,4,As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet The voice of one crying in the wilderness [shouting in the desert]: Prepare the way of the Lord make His beaten paths straight.
Luke,3,5,Every valley and ravine shall be filled up and every mountain and hill shall be leveled; and the crooked places shall be made straight and the rough roads shall be made smooth;
Luke,3,6,And all mankind shall see (behold and understand and at last acknowledge) the salvation of God (the deliverance from eternal death decreed by God).
Luke,3,7,So he said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him You offspring of vipers! Who secretly warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Luke,3,8,Bear fruits that are deserving and consistent with [your] repentance [that is conduct worthy of a heart changed a heart abhorring sin]. And do not begin to say to yourselves We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up descendants for Abraham.
Luke,3,9,Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees so that every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
Luke,3,10,And the multitudes asked him Then what shall we do?
Luke,3,11,And he replied to them He who has two tunics (undergarments) let him share with him who has none; and he who has food let him do it the same way.
Luke,3,12,Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him Teacher what shall we do?
Luke,3,13,And he said to them Exact and collect no more than the fixed amount appointed you.
Luke,3,14,Those serving as soldiers also asked him And we what shall we do? And he replied to them Never demand or enforce by terrifying people or by accusing wrongfully and always be satisfied with your rations (supplies) and with your allowance (wages).
Luke,3,15,As the people were in suspense and waiting expectantly and everybody reasoned and questioned in their hearts concerning John whether he perhaps might be the Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Luke,3,16,John answered them all by saying I baptize you with water; but He Who is mightier than I is coming the strap of Whose sandals I am not fit to unfasten. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
Luke,3,17,His winnowing shovel (fork) is in His hand to thoroughly clear and cleanse His [threshing] floor and to gather the wheat and store it in His granary but the chaff He will burn with fire that cannot be extinguished.
Luke,3,18,So with many other [various] appeals and admonitions he preached the good news (the Gospel) to the people.
Luke,3,19,But Herod the tetrarch who had been [repeatedly] told about his fault and reproved with rebuke producing conviction by [John] for [having] Herodias his brother's wife and for all the wicked things that Herod had done
Luke,3,20,Added this to them all--that he shut up John in prison.
Luke,3,21,Now when all the people were baptized and when Jesus also had been baptized and [while He was still] praying the [visible] heaven was opened
Luke,3,22,And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove and a voice came from heaven saying You are My Son My Beloved! In You I am well pleased and find delight!
Luke,3,23,Jesus Himself when He began [His ministry] was about thirty years of age being the Son as was supposed of Joseph the son of Heli
Luke,3,24,The son of Matthat the son of Levi the son of Melchi the son of Jannai the son of Joseph
Luke,3,25,The son of Mattathias the son of Amos the son of Nahum the son of Esli the son of Naggai
Luke,3,26,The son of Maath the son of Mattathias the son of Semein the son of Josech the son of Joda
Luke,3,27,The son of Joanan the son of Rhesa the son of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel the son of Neri
Luke,3,28,The son of Melchi the son of Addi the son of Cosam the son of Elmadam the son of Er
Luke,3,29,The son of Jesus the son of Eliezer the son of Jorim the son of Matthat the son of Levi
Luke,3,30,The son of Simeon the son of Judah the son of Joseph the son of Jonam the son of Eliakim
Luke,3,31,The son of Melea the son of Menna the son of Mattatha the son of Nathan the son of David
Luke,3,32,The son of Jesse the son of Obed the son of Boaz the son of Salmon (Sala) the son of Nahshon
Luke,3,33,The son of Aminadab the son of Admin the son of Arni the son of Hezron the son of Perez the son of Judah
Luke,3,34,The son of Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Abraham the son of Terah the son of Nahor
Luke,3,35,The son of Serug the son of Reu the son of Peleg the son of Eber the son of Shelah
Luke,3,36,The son of Cainan the son of Arphaxad the son of Shem the son of Noah the son of Lamech
Luke,3,37,The son of Methuselah the son of Enoch the son of Jared the son of Mahalaleel the son of Cainan
Luke,3,38,The son of Enos the son of Seth the son of Adam the son of God.
Luke,4,1,THEN JESUS full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was led in [by] the [Holy] Spirit
Luke,4,2,For (during) forty days in the wilderness (desert) where He was tempted ( tried tested exceedingly) by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days and when they were completed He was hungry.
Luke,4,3,Then the devil said to Him If You are the Son of God order this stone to turn into a loaf [of bread].
Luke,4,4,And Jesus replied to him It is written Man shall not live and be sustained by (on) bread alone but by every word and expression of God.
Luke,4,5,Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time [ in the twinkling of an eye].
Luke,4,6,And he said to Him To You I will give all this power and authority and their glory (all their magnificence excellence preeminence dignity and grace) for it has been turned over to me and I give it to whomever I will.
Luke,4,7,Therefore if You will do homage to and worship me [ just once] it shall all be Yours.
Luke,4,8,And Jesus replied to him Get behind Me Satan! It is written You shall do homage to and worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.
Luke,4,9,Then he took Him to Jerusalem and set Him on a gable of the temple and said to Him If You are the Son of God cast Yourself down from here;
Luke,4,10,For it is written He will give His angels charge over you to guard and watch over you closely and carefully;
Luke,4,11,And on their hands they will bear you up lest you strike your foot against a stone.
Luke,4,12,And Jesus replied to him [The Scripture] says You shall not tempt (try test exceedingly) the Lord your God.
Luke,4,13,And when the devil had ended every [the complete cycle of] temptation he [temporarily] left Him [that is stood off from Him] until another more opportune and favorable time.
Luke,4,14,Then Jesus went back full of and under the power of the [Holy] Spirit into Galilee and the fame of Him spread through the whole region round about.
Luke,4,15,And He Himself conducted [ a course of] teaching in their synagogues being recognized and honored and praised by all.
Luke,4,16,So He came to Nazareth [ that Nazareth] where He had been brought up and He entered the synagogue as was His custom on the Sabbath day. And He stood up to read.
Luke,4,17,And there was handed to Him [the roll of] the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened (unrolled) the book and found the place where it was written
Luke,4,18,The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon Me because He has anointed Me [the Anointed One the Messiah] to preach the good news (the Gospel) to the poor; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [who are downtrodden bruised crushed and broken down by calamity]
Luke,4,19,To proclaim the accepted and acceptable year of the Lord [the day when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound.
Luke,4,20,Then He rolled up the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing [attentively] at Him.
Luke,4,21,And He began to speak to them: Today this Scripture has been fulfilled while you are present and hearing.
Luke,4,22,And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came forth from His mouth; and they said Is not this Joseph's Son?
Luke,4,23,So He said to them You will doubtless quote to Me this proverb: Physician heal Yourself! What we have learned by hearsay that You did in Capernaum do here also in Your [own] town.
Luke,4,24,Then He said Solemnly I say to you no prophet is acceptable and welcome in his [own] town (country).
Luke,4,25,But in truth I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heavens were closed up for three years and six months so that there came a great famine over all the land;
Luke,4,26,And yet Elijah was not sent to a single one of them but only to Zarephath in the country of Sidon to a woman who was a widow. [I Kings 17:1 8-16; 18:1.]
Luke,4,27,And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet and yet not one of them was cleansed [by being healed]--but only Naaman the Syrian. [II Kings 5:1-14.]
Luke,4,28,When they heard these things all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage.
Luke,4,29,And rising up they pushed and drove Him out of the town and [laying hold of Him] they led Him to the [projecting] upper part of the hill on which their town was built that they might hurl Him headlong down [over the cliff].
Luke,4,30,But passing through their midst He went on His way.
Luke,4,31,And He descended to Capernaum a town of Galilee and there He continued to teach the people on the Sabbath days.
Luke,4,32,And they were amazed at His teaching for His word was with authority and ability and weight and power.
Luke,4,33,Now in the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by the foul spirit of a demon; and he cried out with a loud (deep terrible) cry
Luke,4,34,Ah let us alone! What have You to do with us [What have we in common] Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know Who You are--the Holy One of God!
Luke,4,35,But Jesus rebuked him saying Be silent (muzzled gagged) and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown the man down in their midst he came out of him without injuring him in any possible way.
Luke,4,36,And they were all amazed and said to one another What kind of talk is this? For with authority and power He commands the foul spirits and they come out!
Luke,4,37,And a rumor about Him spread into every place in the surrounding country.
Luke,4,38,Then He arose and left the synagogue and went into Simon's (Peter's) house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering in the grip of a burning fever and they pleaded with Him for her.
Luke,4,39,And standing over her He rebuked the fever and it left her; and immediately she got up and began waiting on them.
Luke,4,40,Now at the setting of the sun [indicating the end of the Sabbath] all those who had any [who were] sick with various diseases brought them to Him and He laid His hands upon every one of them and cured them.
Luke,4,41,And demons even came out of many people screaming and crying out You are the Son of God! But He rebuked them and would not permit them to speak because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah).
Luke,4,42,And when daybreak came He left [Peter's house] and went into an isolated [desert] place. And the people looked for Him until they came up to Him and tried to prevent Him from leaving them.
Luke,4,43,But He said to them I must preach the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God to the other cities [and towns] also for I was sent for this [purpose].
Luke,4,44,And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
Luke,5,1,NOW IT occurred that while the people pressed upon Jesus to hear the message of God He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret (Sea of Galilee).
Luke,5,2,And He saw two boats drawn up by the lake but the fishermen had gone down from them and were washing their nets.
Luke,5,3,And getting into one of the boats [the one] that belonged to Simon (Peter) He requested him to draw away a little from the shore. Then He sat down and continued to teach the crowd [of people] from the boat.
Luke,5,4,When He had stopped speaking He said to Simon (Peter) Put out into the deep [water] and lower your nets for a haul.
Luke,5,5,And Simon (Peter) answered Master we toiled all night [ exhaustingly] and caught nothing [in our nets]. But on the ground of Your word I will lower the nets [again].
Luke,5,6,And when they had done this they caught a great number of fish; and as their nets were [ at the point of] breaking
Luke,5,7,They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them. And they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink.
Luke,5,8,But when Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus' knees saying Depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord.
Luke,5,9,For he was gripped with bewildering amazement [allied to terror] and all who were with him at the haul of fish which they had made;
Luke,5,10,And so also were James and John the sons of Zebedee who were partners with Simon (Peter). And Jesus said to Simon Have no fear; from now on you will be catching men!
Luke,5,11,And after they had run their boats on shore they left everything and joined Him as His disciples and sided with His party and accompanied Him.
Luke,5,12,While He was in one of the towns there came a man full of (covered with) leprosy; and when he saw Jesus he fell on his face and implored Him saying Lord if You are willing You are able to cure me and make me clean.
Luke,5,13,And [Jesus] reached out His hand and touched him saying I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him.
Luke,5,14,And [Jesus] charged him to tell no one [ that he might chance to meet] until [He said] you go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your purification as Moses commanded for a testimony and proof to the people that they may have evidence [of your healing].
Luke,5,15,But so much the more the news spread abroad concerning Him and great crowds kept coming together to hear [Him] and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.
Luke,5,16,But He Himself withdrew [in retirement] to the wilderness (desert) and prayed.
Luke,5,17,One of those days as He was teaching there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by who had come from every village and town of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was [present] with Him to heal them.
Luke,5,18,And behold some men were bringing on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed and they tried to carry him in and lay him before [Jesus].
Luke,5,19,But finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and lowered him with his stretcher through the tiles into the midst in front of Jesus.
Luke,5,20,And when He saw [their confidence in Him springing from] their faith He said Man your sins are forgiven you!
Luke,5,21,And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason and question and argue saying Who is this [Man] Who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
Luke,5,22,But Jesus knowing their thoughts and questionings answered them Why do you question in your hearts?
Luke,5,23,Which is easier: to say Your sins are forgiven you or to say Arise and walk [about]?
Luke,5,24,But that you may know that the Son of Man has the [ power of] authority and right on earth to forgive sins He said to the paralyzed man I say to you arise pick up your litter (stretcher) and go to your own house!
Luke,5,25,And instantly [the man] stood up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went away to his house recognizing and praising and thanking God.
Luke,5,26,And overwhelming astonishment and ecstasy seized them all and they recognized and praised and thanked God; and they were filled with and controlled by reverential fear and kept saying We have seen wonderful and strange and incredible and unthinkable things today!
Luke,5,27,And after this Jesus went out and looked [attentively] at a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office; and He said to him Join Me as a disciple and side with My party and accompany Me.
Luke,5,28,And he forsook everything and got up and followed Him [becoming His disciple and siding with His party].
Luke,5,29,And Levi (Matthew) made a great banquet for Him in his own house and there was a large company of tax collectors and others who were reclining [at the table] with them.
Luke,5,30,Now the Pharisees and their scribes were grumbling against Jesus' disciples saying Why are you eating and drinking with tax collectors and [preeminently] sinful people?
Luke,5,31,And Jesus replied to them It is not those who are healthy who need a physician but those who are sick.
Luke,5,32,I have not come to arouse and invite and call the righteous but the erring ones ( those not free from sin) to repentance [ to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways with abhorrence of their past sins].
Luke,5,33,Then they said to Him The disciples of John practice fasting often and offer up prayers of [special] petition and so do [the disciples] of the Pharisees also but Yours eat and drink.
Luke,5,34,And Jesus said to them Can you make the wedding guests fast as long as the bridegroom is with them?
Luke,5,35,But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; and then they will fast in those days.
Luke,5,36,He told them a proverb also: No one puts a patch from a new garment on an old garment; if he does he will both tear the new one and the patch from the new [one] will not match the old [garment].
Luke,5,37,And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; if he does the fresh wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be ruined (destroyed).
Luke,5,38,But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
Luke,5,39,And no one after drinking old wine immediately desires new wine for he says The old is good or better.
Luke,6,1,ONE SABBATH while Jesus was passing through the fields of standing grain it occurred that His disciples picked some of the spikes and ate [of the grain] rubbing it out in their hands.
Luke,6,2,But some of the Pharisees asked them Why are you doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath days?
Luke,6,3,And Jesus replied to them saying Have you never so much as read what David did when he was hungry he and those who were with him?--[I Sam. 21:1-6.]
Luke,6,4,How he went into the house of God and took and ate the [sacred] loaves of the showbread which it is not permitted for any except only the priests to eat and also gave to those [who were] with him?
Luke,6,5,And He said to them The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Luke,6,6,And it occurred on another Sabbath that when He went into the synagogue and taught a man was present whose right hand was withered.
Luke,6,7,And the scribes and the Pharisees kept watching Jesus to see whether He would [actually] heal on the Sabbath in order that they might get [some ground for] accusation against Him.
Luke,6,8,But He was aware all along of their thoughts and He said to the man with the withered hand Come and stand here in the midst. And he arose and stood there.
Luke,6,9,Then Jesus said to them I ask you is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good [ so that someone derives advantage from it] or to do evil to save a life [and make a soul safe] or to destroy it?
Luke,6,10,Then He glanced around at them all and said to the man Stretch out your hand! And he did so and his hand was fully restored like the other one.
Luke,6,11,But they were filled with lack of understanding and senseless rage and discussed (consulted) with one another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke,6,12,Now in those days it occurred that He went up into a mountain to pray and spent the whole night in prayer to God.
Luke,6,13,And when it was day He summoned His disciples and selected from them twelve whom He named apostles (special messengers):
Luke,6,14,They were Simon whom He named Peter and his brother Andrew; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;
Luke,6,15,And Matthew and Thomas; and James son of Alphaeus and Simon who was called the Zealot
Luke,6,16,And Judas son of James and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor (a treacherous basely faithless person).
Luke,6,17,And Jesus came down with them and took His stand on a level spot with a great crowd of His disciples and a vast throng of people from all over Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon who came to listen to Him and to be cured of their diseases--
Luke,6,18,Even those who were disturbed and troubled with unclean spirits and they were being healed [also].
Luke,6,19,And all the multitude were seeking to touch Him for healing power was all the while going forth from Him and curing them all [ saving them from severe illnesses or calamities].
Luke,6,20,And solemnly lifting up His eyes on His disciples He said: Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you poor and lowly and afflicted (destitute of wealth influence position and honor) for the kingdom of God is yours!
Luke,6,21,Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you who hunger and seek with eager desire now for you shall be filled and completely satisfied! Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you who weep and sob now for you shall laugh!
Luke,6,22,Blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation apart from your outward condition--and to be envied) are you when people despise (hate) you and when they exclude and excommunicate you [as disreputable] and revile and denounce you and defame and cast out and spurn your name as evil (wicked) on account of the Son of Man.
Luke,6,23,Rejoice and be glad at such a time and exult and leap for joy for behold your reward is rich and great and strong and intense and abundant in heaven; for even so their forefathers treated the prophets.
Luke,6,24,But woe to (alas for) you who are rich ( abounding in material resources) for you already are receiving your consolation (the solace and sense of strengthening and cheer that come from prosperity) and have taken and enjoyed your comfort in full [having nothing left to be awarded you].
Luke,6,25,Woe to (alas for) you who are full now (completely filled luxuriously gorged and satiated) for you shall hunger and suffer want! Woe to (alas for) you who laugh now for you shall mourn and weep and wail!
Luke,6,26,Woe to (alas for) you when everyone speaks fairly and handsomely of you and praises you for even so their forefathers did to the false prophets.
Luke,6,27,But I say to you who are listening now to Me: [ in order to heed make it a practice to] love your enemies treat well (do good to act nobly toward) those who detest you and pursue you with hatred
Luke,6,28,Invoke blessings upon and pray for the happiness of those who curse you implore God's blessing (favor) upon those who abuse you [who revile reproach disparage and high-handedly misuse you].
Luke,6,29,To the one who strikes you on the jaw or cheek offer the other jaw or cheek also; and from him who takes away your outer garment do not withhold your undergarment as well.
Luke,6,30,Give away to everyone who begs of you [who is in want of necessities] and of him who takes away from you your goods do not demand or require them back again.
Luke,6,31,And as you would like and desire that men would do to you do exactly so to them.
Luke,6,32,If you [merely] love those who love you what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? For even the [very] sinners love their lovers (those who love them).
Luke,6,33,And if you are kind and good and do favors to and benefit those who are kind and good and do favors to and benefit you what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? For even the preeminently sinful do the same.
Luke,6,34,And if you lend money at interest to those from whom you hope to receive what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? Even notorious sinners lend money at interest to sinners so as to recover as much again.
Luke,6,35,But love your enemies and be kind and do good [doing favors so that someone derives benefit from them] and lend expecting and hoping for nothing in return but considering nothing as lost and despairing of no one; and then your recompense (your reward) will be great (rich strong intense and abundant) and you will be sons of the Most High for He is kind and charitable and good to the ungrateful and the selfish and wicked.
Luke,6,36,So be merciful (sympathetic tender responsive and compassionate) even as your Father is [all these].
Luke,6,37,Judge not [neither pronouncing judgment nor subjecting to censure] and you will not be judged; do not condemn and pronounce guilty and you will not be condemned and pronounced guilty; acquit and forgive and release (give up resentment let it drop) and you will be acquitted and forgiven and released.
Luke,6,38,Give and [gifts] will be given to you; good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will they pour into [the pouch formed by] the bosom [of your robe and used as a bag]. For with the measure you deal out [with the measure you use when you confer benefits on others] it will be measured back to you.
Luke,6,39,He further told them a proverb: Can a blind [man] guide and direct a blind [man]? Will they not both stumble into a ditch or a hole in the ground?
Luke,6,40,A pupil is not superior to his teacher but everyone [when he is] completely trained (readjusted restored set to rights and perfected) will be like his teacher.
Luke,6,41,Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but do not notice or consider the beam [of timber] that is in your own eye?
Luke,6,42,Or how can you say to your brother Brother allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? You actor (pretender hypocrite)! First take the beam out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.
Luke,6,43,For there is no good (healthy) tree that bears decayed (worthless stale) fruit nor on the other hand does a decayed (worthless sickly) tree bear good fruit.
Luke,6,44,For each tree is known and identified by its own fruit; for figs are not gathered from thornbushes nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a bramblebush.
Luke,6,45,The upright (honorable intrinsically good) man out of the good treasure [stored] in his heart produces what is upright (honorable and intrinsically good) and the evil man out of the evil storehouse brings forth that which is depraved (wicked and intrinsically evil); for out of the abundance (overflow) of the heart his mouth speaks.
Luke,6,46,Why do you call Me Lord Lord and do not [practice] what I tell you?
Luke,6,47,For everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words [in order to heed their teaching] and does them I will show you what he is like:
Luke,6,48,He is like a man building a house who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; and when a flood arose the torrent broke against that house and could not shake or move it because it had been securely built or founded on a rock.
Luke,6,49,But he who merely hears and does not practice doing My words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation against which the torrent burst and immediately it collapsed and fell and the breaking and ruin of that house was great.
Luke,7,1,AFTER JESUS had finished all that He had to say in the hearing of the people [on the mountain] He entered Capernaum.
Luke,7,2,Now a centurion had a bond servant who was held in honor and highly valued by him who was sick and at the point of death.
Luke,7,3,And when the centurion heard of Jesus he sent some Jewish elders to Him requesting Him to come and make his bond servant well.
Luke,7,4,And when they reached Jesus they begged Him earnestly saying He is worthy that You should do this for him
Luke,7,5,For he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue [at his own expense].
Luke,7,6,And Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house the centurion sent [some] friends to Him saying Lord do not trouble [Yourself] for I am not sufficiently worthy to have You come under my roof;
Luke,7,7,Neither did I consider myself worthy to come to You. But [just] speak a word and my servant boy will be healed.
Luke,7,8,For I also am a man [daily] subject to authority with soldiers under me. And I say to one Go and he goes; and to another Come and he comes; and to my bond servant Do this and he does it.
Luke,7,9,Now when Jesus heard this He marveled at him and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him I tell you not even in [all] Israel have I found such great faith [as this].
Luke,7,10,And when the messengers who had been sent returned to the house they found the bond servant who had been ill quite well again.
Luke,7,11,Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain and His disciples and a great throng accompanied Him.
Luke,7,12,[Just] as He drew near the gate of the town behold a man who had died was being carried out--the only son of his mother and she was a widow; and a large gathering from the town was accompanying her.
Luke,7,13,And when the Lord saw her He had compassion on her and said to her Do not weep.
Luke,7,14,And He went forward and touched the funeral bier and the pallbearers stood still. And He said Young man I say to you arise [ from death]!
Luke,7,15,And the man [who was] dead sat up and began to speak. And [Jesus] gave him [back] to his mother.
Luke,7,16,Profound and reverent fear seized them all and they began to recognize God and praise and give thanks saying A great Prophet has appeared among us! And God has visited His people [in order to help and care for and provide for them]!
Luke,7,17,And this report concerning [Jesus] spread through the whole of Judea and all the country round about. [I Kings 17:17-24; II Kings 4:32-37.]
Luke,7,18,And John's disciples brought him [who was now in prison] word of all these things.
Luke,7,19,And John summoned to him a certain two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord saying Are You He Who is to come or shall we [continue to] look for another?
Luke,7,20,So the men came to Jesus and said John the Baptist sent us to You to ask Are You the One Who is to come or shall we [continue to] look for another?
Luke,7,21,In that very hour Jesus was healing many [people] of sicknesses and distressing bodily plagues and evil spirits and to many who were blind He gave [ a free gracious joy-giving gift of] sight.
Luke,7,22,So He replied to them Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the good news (the Gospel) preached to them.
Luke,7,23,And blessed (happy--with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation apart from outward conditions--and to be envied) is he who takes no offense in Me and who is not hurt or resentful or annoyed or repelled or made to stumble [ whatever may occur].
Luke,7,24,And the messengers of John having departed Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the desert to gaze on? A reed shaken and swayed by the wind?
Luke,7,25,Then what did you go out to see? A man dressed up in soft garments? Behold those who wear fine apparel and live in luxury are in the courts or palaces of kings.
Luke,7,26,What then did you go out to see? A prophet (a forthteller)? Yes I tell you and far more than a prophet.
Luke,7,27,This is the one of whom it is written Behold I send My messenger before Your face who shall make ready Your way before You.
Luke,7,28,I tell you among those born of women there is no one greater than John; but he that is inferior [to the other citizens] in the kingdom of God is greater [in incomparable privilege] than he.
Luke,7,29,And all the people who heard Him even the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of God [in calling them to repentance and in pronouncing future wrath on the impenitent] being baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke,7,30,But the Pharisees and the lawyers [of the Mosaic Law] annulled and rejected and brought to nothing God's purpose concerning themselves by [refusing and] not being baptized by him [John].
Luke,7,31,So to what shall I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?
Luke,7,32,They are like little children sitting in the marketplace calling to one another and saying We piped to you [playing wedding] and you did not dance; we sang dirges and wailed [playing funeral] and you did not weep.
Luke,7,33,For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you say He has a demon.
Luke,7,34,The Son of Man has come eating and drinking and you say Behold a Man Who is a glutton and a wine drinker a friend of tax collectors and notorious sinners.
Luke,7,35,Yet wisdom is vindicated ( shown to be true and divine) by all her children [ by their life character and deeds].
Luke,7,36,One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him and He went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table.
Luke,7,37,And behold a woman of the town who was an especially wicked sinner when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house brought an alabaster flask of ointment (perfume).
Luke,7,38,And standing behind Him at His feet weeping she began to wet His feet with [her] tears; and she wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed His feet [affectionately] and anointed them with the ointment (perfume).
Luke,7,39,Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw it he said to himself If this Man were a prophet He would surely know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him--for she is a notorious sinner (a social outcast devoted to sin).
Luke,7,40,And Jesus replying said to him Simon I have something to say to you. And he answered Teacher say it.
Luke,7,41,A certain lender of money [at interest] had two debtors: one owed him five hundred denarii and the other fifty.
Luke,7,42,When they had no means of paying he freely forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?
Luke,7,43,Simon answered The one I take it for whom he forgave and cancelled more. And Jesus said to him You have decided correctly.
Luke,7,44,Then turning toward the woman He said to Simon Do you see this woman? When I came into your house you gave Me no water for My feet but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
Luke,7,45,You gave Me no kiss but she from the moment I came in has not ceased [ intermittently] to kiss My feet tenderly and caressingly.
Luke,7,46,You did not anoint My head with [cheap ordinary] oil but she has anointed My feet with [costly rare] perfume.
Luke,7,47,Therefore I tell you her sins many [as they are] are forgiven her--because she has loved much. But he who is forgiven little loves little.
Luke,7,48,And He said to her Your sins are forgiven!
Luke,7,49,Then those who were at table with Him began to say among themselves Who is this Who even forgives sins?
Luke,7,50,But Jesus said to the woman Your faith has saved you; go (enter) into peace [ in freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin].
Luke,8,1,SOON AFTERWARD [Jesus] went on through towns and villages preaching and bringing the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve [apostles] were with Him
Luke,8,2,And also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had been expelled;
Luke,8,3,And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's household manager; and Susanna; and many others who ministered to and provided for Him and them out of their property and personal belongings.
Luke,8,4,And when a very great throng was gathering together and people from town after town kept coming to Jesus He said in a parable:
Luke,8,5,A sower went out to sow seed; and as he sowed some fell along the traveled path and was trodden underfoot and the birds of the air ate it up.
Luke,8,6,And some [seed] fell on the rock and as soon as it sprouted it withered away because it had no moisture.
Luke,8,7,And other [seed] fell in the midst of the thorns and the thorns grew up with it and choked it [off].
Luke,8,8,And some seed fell into good soil and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times [as great]. As He said these things He called out He who has ears to hear let him be listening and let him consider and understand by hearing!
Luke,8,9,And when His disciples asked Him the meaning of this parable
Luke,8,10,He said to them To you it has been given to [come progressively to] know (to recognize and understand more strongly and clearly) the mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God but for others they are in parables so that [though] looking they may not see; and hearing they may not comprehend.
Luke,8,11,Now the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.
Luke,8,12,Those along the traveled road are the people who have heard; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts that they may not believe ( acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me) and be saved [here and hereafter].
Luke,8,13,And those upon the rock [are the people] who when they hear [the Word] receive and welcome it with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while and in time of trial and temptation fall away (withdraw and stand aloof).
Luke,8,14,And as for what fell among the thorns these are [the people] who hear but as they go on their way they are choked and suffocated with the anxieties and cares and riches and pleasures of life and their fruit does not ripen (come to maturity and perfection).
Luke,8,15,But as for that [seed] in the good soil these are [the people] who hearing the Word hold it fast in a just ( noble virtuous) and worthy heart and steadily bring forth fruit with patience.
Luke,8,16,No one after he has lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a [dining table] couch; but he puts it on a lampstand that those who come in may see the light.
Luke,8,17,For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed nor anything secret that shall not be known and come out into the open.
Luke,8,18,Be careful therefore how you listen. For to him who has [spiritual knowledge] will more be given; and from him who does not have [spiritual knowledge] even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has will be taken away.
Luke,8,19,Then Jesus' mother and His brothers came along toward Him but they could not get to Him because of the crowd.
Luke,8,20,And it was told Him Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside desiring to have an interview with You.
Luke,8,21,But He answered them My mother and My brothers are those who listen to the Word of God and do it!
Luke,8,22,One of those days He and His disciples got into a boat and He said to them Let us go across to the other side of the lake. So they put out to sea.
Luke,8,23,But as they were sailing He fell off to sleep. And a whirlwind revolving from below upwards swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in great danger.
Luke,8,24,And the disciples came and woke Him saying Master Master we are perishing! And He being thoroughly awakened censured and blamed and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased and there came a calm.
Luke,8,25,And He said to them [Why are you so fearful?] Where is your faith (your trust your confidence in Me--in My veracity and My integrity)? And they were seized with alarm and profound and reverent dread and they marveled saying to one another Who then is this that He commands even wind and sea and they obey Him?
Luke,8,26,Then they came to the country of the Gerasenes which is opposite Galilee.
Luke,8,27,Now when Jesus stepped out on land there met Him a certain man out of the town who had [was possessed by] demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes and he lived not in a house but in the tombs.
Luke,8,28,And when he saw Jesus he raised a deep (terrible) cry [from the depths of his throat] and fell down before Him [in terror] and shouted loudly What have You [to do] with me Jesus Son of the Most High God? [ What have we in common?] I beg You do not torment me!
Luke,8,29,For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had snatched and held him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilderness (desert).
Luke,8,30,Jesus then asked him What is your name? And he answered Legion; for many demons had entered him.
Luke,8,31,And they begged [Jesus] not to command them to depart into the Abyss (bottomless pit).
Luke,8,32,Now a great herd of swine was there feeding on the hillside; and [the demons] begged Him to give them leave to enter these. And He allowed them [to do so].
Luke,8,33,Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the steep cliff into the lake and were drowned.
Luke,8,34,When the herdsmen saw what had happened they ran away and told it in the town and in the country.
Luke,8,35,And [people] went out to see what had occurred and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right (sound) mind; and they were seized with alarm and fear.
Luke,8,36,And those [also] who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was restored [to health].
Luke,8,37,Then all the people of the country surrounding the Gerasenes' district asked [Jesus] to depart from them for they were possessed and suffering with dread and terror; so He entered a boat and returned [to the west side of the Sea of Galilee].
Luke,8,38,But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging and praying that he might accompany Him and be with Him but [Jesus] sent him away saying
Luke,8,39,Return to your home and recount [the story] of how many and great things God has done for you. And [the man] departed proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
Luke,8,40,Now when Jesus came back [to Galilee] the crowd received and welcomed Him gladly for they were all waiting and looking for Him.
Luke,8,41,And there came a man named Jairus who had [for a long time] been a director of the synagogue; and falling at the feet of Jesus he begged Him to come to his house
Luke,8,42,For he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying. As [Jesus] went the people pressed together around Him [almost suffocating Him].
Luke,8,43,And a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years and had spent all her living upon physicians and could not be healed by anyone
Luke,8,44,Came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment and immediately her flow of blood ceased.
Luke,8,45,And Jesus said Who is it who touched Me? When all were denying it Peter and those who were with him said Master the multitudes surround You and press You on every side!
Luke,8,46,But Jesus said Someone did touch Me; for I perceived that [healing] power has gone forth from Me.
Luke,8,47,And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice she came up trembling and falling down before Him she declared in the presence of all the people for what reason she had touched Him and how she had been instantly cured.
Luke,8,48,And He said to her Daughter your faith (your confidence and trust in Me) has made you well! Go (enter) into peace ( untroubled undisturbed well-being).
Luke,8,49,While He was still speaking a man from the house of the director of the synagogue came and said [to Jairus] Your daughter is dead; do not weary and trouble the Teacher any further.
Luke,8,50,But Jesus on hearing this answered him Do not be seized with alarm or struck with fear; simply believe [ in Me as able to do this] and she shall be made well.
Luke,8,51,And when He came to the house He permitted no one to enter with Him except Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.
Luke,8,52,And all were weeping for and bewailing her; but He said Do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping.
Luke,8,53,And they laughed Him to scorn knowing full well that she was dead.
Luke,8,54,And grasping her hand He called saying Child arise [ from the sleep of death]!
Luke,8,55,And her spirit returned [ from death] and she arose immediately; and He directed that she should be given something to eat.
Luke,8,56,And her parents were amazed but He charged them to tell no one what had occurred.
Luke,9,1,THEN JESUS called together the Twelve [apostles] and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases
Luke,9,2,And He sent them out to announce and preach the kingdom of God and to bring healing.
Luke,9,3,And He said to them Do not take anything for your journey--neither walking stick nor wallet [for a collection bag] nor food of any kind nor money and do not have two undergarments (tunics).
Luke,9,4,And whatever house you enter stay there until you go away [from that place].
Luke,9,5,And wherever they do not receive and accept and welcome you when you leave that town shake off [even] the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.
Luke,9,6,And departing they went about from village to village preaching the Gospel and restoring the afflicted to health everywhere.
Luke,9,7,Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was being done by [Jesus] and he was [thoroughly] perplexed and troubled because it was said by some that John [the Baptist] had been raised from the dead
Luke,9,8,And by others that Elijah had appeared and by others that one of the prophets of old had come back to life.
Luke,9,9,But Herod said John I beheaded; but Who is this about Whom I [learn] such things by hearsay? And he sought to see Him.
Luke,9,10,Upon their return the apostles reported to Jesus all that they had done. And He took them [along with Him] and withdrew into privacy near a town called Bethsaida.
Luke,9,11,But when the crowds learned of it [they] followed Him; and He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who needed restoration to health.
Luke,9,12,Now the day began to decline and the Twelve came and said to Him Dismiss the crowds and send them away so that they may go to the neighboring hamlets and villages and the surrounding country and find lodging and get a supply of provisions for we are here in an uninhabited (barren solitary) place.
Luke,9,13,But He said to them You [yourselves] give them [food] to eat. They said We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless we are to go and buy food for all this crowd [II Kings 4:42-44.]
Luke,9,14,For there were about 5000 men. And [Jesus] said to His disciples Have them [sit down] reclining in table groups (companies) of about fifty each.
Luke,9,15,And they did so and made them all recline.
Luke,9,16,And taking the five loaves and the two fish He looked up to heaven and [praising God] gave thanks and asked Him to bless them [to their use]. Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples to place before the multitude.
Luke,9,17,And all the people ate and were satisfied. And they gathered up what remained over--twelve [ small hand] baskets of broken pieces.
Luke,9,18,Now it occurred that as Jesus was praying privately the disciples were with Him and He asked them Who do men say that I am?
Luke,9,19,And they answered John the Baptist; but some say Elijah; and others that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life.
Luke,9,20,And He said to them But who do you [yourselves] say that I am? And Peter replied The Christ of God!
Luke,9,21,But He strictly charged and sharply commanded them [ under penalty] to tell this to no one [no one whoever he might be]
Luke,9,22,Saying The Son of Man must suffer many things and be [ deliberately] disapproved and repudiated and rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be put to death and on the third day be raised [again].
Luke,9,23,And He said to all If any person wills to come after Me let him deny himself [ disown himself forget lose sight of himself and his own interests refuse and give up himself] and take up his cross daily and follow Me [ cleave steadfastly to Me conform wholly to My example in living and if need be in dying also].
Luke,9,24,For whoever would preserve his life and save it will lose and destroy it but whoever loses his life for My sake he will preserve and save it [ from the penalty of eternal death].
Luke,9,25,For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and ruins or forfeits (loses) himself?
Luke,9,26,Because whoever is ashamed of Me and of My teachings of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the [ threefold] glory (the splendor and majesty) of Himself and of the Father and of the holy angels.
Luke,9,27,However I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.
Luke,9,28,Now about eight days after these teachings Jesus took with Him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
Luke,9,29,And as He was praying the appearance of His countenance became altered (different) and His raiment became dazzling white [ flashing with the brilliance of lightning].
Luke,9,30,And behold two men were conversing with Him--Moses and Elijah
Luke,9,31,Who appeared in splendor and majesty and brightness and were speaking of His exit [from life] which He was about to bring to realization at Jerusalem.
Luke,9,32,Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep but when they fully awoke they saw His glory (splendor and majesty and brightness) and the two men who stood with Him.
Luke,9,33,And it occurred as the men were parting from Him that Peter said to Jesus Master it is delightful and good that we are here; and let us construct three booths or huts--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah! not noticing or knowing what he was saying.
Luke,9,34,But even as he was saying this a cloud came and began to overshadow them and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear as they entered into the cloud.
Luke,9,35,Then there came a voice out of the cloud saying This is My Son My Chosen One or My Beloved; listen to and yield to and obey Him!
Luke,9,36,And when the voice had died away Jesus was found there alone. And they kept still and told no one at that time any of these things that they had seen.
Luke,9,37,Now it occurred the next day when they had come down from the mountain that a great multitude met Him.
Luke,9,38,And behold a man from the crowd shouted out Master I implore You to look at my son for he is my only child;
Luke,9,39,And behold a spirit seizes him and suddenly he cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and he is sorely shattered and it will scarcely leave him.
Luke,9,40,And I implored Your disciples to drive it out but they could not.
Luke,9,41,Jesus answered O [faithless ones] unbelieving and without trust in God a perverse ( wayward crooked and warped) generation! Until when and how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here [to Me].
Luke,9,42,And even while he was coming the demon threw him down and [completely] convulsed him. But Jesus censured and severely rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and restored him to his father.
Luke,9,43,And all were astounded at the evidence of God's mighty power and His majesty and magnificence. But [while] they were all marveling at everything Jesus was doing He said to His disciples
Luke,9,44,Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men [ whose conduct is opposed to God].
Luke,9,45,However they did not comprehend this saying; and it was kept hidden from them so that they should not grasp it and understand and they were afraid to ask Him about the statement.
Luke,9,46,But a controversy arose among them as to which of them might be the greatest [surpassing the others in excellence worth and authority].
Luke,9,47,But Jesus as He perceived the thoughts of their hearts took a little child and put him at His side
Luke,9,48,And told them Whoever receives and accepts and welcomes this child in My name and for My sake receives and accepts and welcomes Me; and whoever so receives Me so also receives Him Who sent Me. For he who is least and lowliest among you all--he is [the one who is truly] great.
Luke,9,49,John said Master we saw a man driving out demons in Your name and we commanded him to stop it for he does not follow along with us.
Luke,9,50,But Jesus told him Do not forbid [such people]; for whoever is not against you is for you.
Luke,9,51,Now when the time was almost come for Jesus to be received up [to heaven] He steadfastly and determinedly set His face to go to Jerusalem.
Luke,9,52,And He sent messengers before Him; and they reached and entered a Samaritan village to make [things] ready for Him;
Luke,9,53,But [the people] would not welcome or receive or accept Him because His face was [set as if He was] going to Jerusalem.
Luke,9,54,And when His disciples James and John observed this they said Lord do You wish us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elijah did? [II Kings 1:9-16.]
Luke,9,55,But He turned and rebuked and severely censured them. He said You do not know of what sort of spirit you are
Luke,9,56,For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them [from the penalty of eternal death]. And they journeyed on to another village.
Luke,9,57,And it occurred that as they were going along the road a man said to Him Lord I will follow You wherever You go.
Luke,9,58,And Jesus told him Foxes have lurking holes and the birds of the air have roosts and nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.
Luke,9,59,And He said to another Become My disciple side with My party and accompany Me! But he replied Lord permit me first to go and bury ( await the death of) my father.
Luke,9,60,But Jesus said to him Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you go and publish abroad throughout all regions the kingdom of God.
Luke,9,61,Another also said I will follow You Lord and become Your disciple and side with Your party; but let me first say good-bye to those at my home.
Luke,9,62,Jesus said to him No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [to the things behind] is fit for the kingdom of God.
Luke,10,1,NOW AFTER this the Lord chose and appointed seventy others and sent them out ahead of Him two by two into every town and place where He Himself was about to come (visit).
Luke,10,2,And He said to them The harvest indeed is abundant [ there is much ripe grain] but the farmhands are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
Luke,10,3,Go your way; behold I send you out like lambs into the midst of wolves.
Luke,10,4,Carry no purse no provisions bag no [change of] sandals; refrain from [retarding your journey by] saluting and wishing anyone well along the way.
Luke,10,5,Whatever house you enter first say Peace be to this household! [ Freedom from all the distresses that result from sin be with this family].
Luke,10,6,And if anyone [worthy] of peace and blessedness is there the peace and blessedness you wish shall come upon him; but if not it shall come back to you.
Luke,10,7,And stay on in the same house eating and drinking what they provide for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.
Luke,10,8,Whenever you go into a town and they receive and accept and welcome you eat what is set before you;
Luke,10,9,And heal the sick in it and say to them The kingdom of God has come close to you.
Luke,10,10,But whenever you go into a town and they do not receive and accept and welcome you go out into its streets and say
Luke,10,11,Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we are wiping off against you; yet know and understand this: the kingdom of God has come near you.
Luke,10,12,I tell you it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that town.
Luke,10,13,Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the mighty miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke,10,14,However it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
Luke,10,15,And you Capernaum will you be exalted unto heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades (the regions of the dead).
Luke,10,16,He who hears and heeds you [disciples] hears and heeds Me; and he who slights and rejects you slights and rejects Me; and he who slights and rejects Me slights and rejects Him who sent Me.
Luke,10,17,The seventy returned with joy saying Lord even the demons are subject to us in Your name!
Luke,10,18,And He said to them I saw Satan falling like a lightning [flash] from heaven.
Luke,10,19,Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you.
Luke,10,20,Nevertheless do not rejoice at this that the spirits are subject to you but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven.
Luke,10,21,In that same hour He rejoiced and gloried in the Holy Spirit and said I thank You Father Lord of heaven and earth that You have concealed these things [relating to salvation] from the wise and understanding and learned and revealed them to babes (the childish unskilled and untaught). Yes Father for such was Your gracious will and choice and good pleasure.
Luke,10,22,All things have been given over into My power by My Father; and no one knows Who the Son is except the Father or Who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son may choose to reveal and make Him known.
Luke,10,23,Then turning to His disciples He said privately Blessed (happy to be envied) are those whose eyes see what you see!
Luke,10,24,For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see and they did not see it and to hear what you hear and they did not hear it.
Luke,10,25,And then a certain lawyer arose to try (test tempt) Him saying Teacher what am I to do to inherit everlasting life [that is to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?
Luke,10,26,Jesus said to him What is written in the Law? How do you read it?
Luke,10,27,And he replied You must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.
Luke,10,28,And Jesus said to him You have answered correctly; do this and you will live [enjoy active blessed endless life in the kingdom of God].
Luke,10,29,And he determined to acquit himself of reproach said to Jesus And who is my neighbor?
Luke,10,30,Jesus taking him up replied A certain man was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho and he fell among robbers who stripped him of his clothes and belongings and beat him and went their way [ unconcernedly] leaving him half dead as it happened.
Luke,10,31,Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down along that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
Luke,10,32,A Levite likewise came down to the place and saw him and passed by on the other side [of the road].
Luke,10,33,But a certain Samaritan as he traveled along came down to where he was; and when he saw him he was moved with pity and sympathy [for him]
Luke,10,34,And went to him and dressed his wounds pouring on [them] oil and wine. Then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
Luke,10,35,And the next day he took out two denarii [two day's wages] and gave [them] to the innkeeper saying Take care of him; and whatever more you spend I [myself] will repay you when I return.
Luke,10,36,Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?
Luke,10,37,He answered The one who showed pity and mercy to him. And Jesus said to him Go and do likewise.
Luke,10,38,Now while they were on their way it occurred that Jesus entered a certain village and a woman named Martha received and welcomed Him into her house.
Luke,10,39,And she had a sister named Mary who seated herself at the Lord's feet and was listening to His teaching.
Luke,10,40,But Martha [overly occupied and too busy] was distracted with much serving; and she came up to Him and said Lord is it nothing to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me [to lend a hand and do her part along with me]!
Luke,10,41,But the Lord replied to her by saying Martha Martha you are anxious and troubled about many things;
Luke,10,42,There is need of only one or but a few things. Mary has chosen the good portion [ that which is to her advantage] which shall not be taken away from her.
Luke,11,1,THEN HE was praying in a certain place; and when He stopped one of His disciples said to Him Lord teach us to pray [just] as John taught his disciples.
Luke,11,2,And He said to them When you pray say: Our Father Who is in heaven hallowed be Your name Your kingdom come. Your will be done [held holy and revered] on earth as it is in heaven.
Luke,11,3,Give us daily our bread [ food for the morrow].
Luke,11,4,And forgive us our sins for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [who has offended us or done us wrong]. And bring us not into temptation but rescue us from evil.
Luke,11,5,And He said to them Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and will say to him Friend lend me three loaves [of bread]
Luke,11,6,For a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come and I have nothing to put before him;
Luke,11,7,And he from within will answer Do not disturb me; the door is now closed and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and supply you [with anything]?
Luke,11,8,I tell you although he will not get up and supply him anything because he is his friend yet because of his shameless persistence and insistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
Luke,11,9,So I say to you Ask and keep on asking and it shall be given you; seek and keep on seeking and you shall find; knock and keep on knocking and the door shall be opened to you.
Luke,11,10,For everyone who asks and keeps on asking receives; and he who seeks and keeps on seeking finds; and to him who knocks and keeps on knocking the door shall be opened.
Luke,11,11,What father among you if his son asks for a loaf of bread will give him a stone; or if he asks for a fish will instead of a fish give him a serpent?
Luke,11,12,Or if he asks for an egg will give him a scorpion?
Luke,11,13,If you then evil as you are know how to give good gifts [gifts that are to their advantage] to your children how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask Him!
Luke,11,14,Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was dumb; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled.
Luke,11,15,But some of them said He drives out demons [because He is in league with and] by Beelzebub the prince of demons
Luke,11,16,While others to try and test and tempt Him demanded a sign of Him from heaven.
Luke,11,17,But He [well] aware of their intent and purpose said to them Every kingdom split up against itself is doomed and brought to desolation and so house falls upon house. [The disunited household will collapse.]
Luke,11,18,And if Satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom last? For you say that I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub.
Luke,11,19,Now if I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub with whose help and by whom do your sons drive them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
Luke,11,20,But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God then the kingdom of God has [already] come upon you.
Luke,11,21,When the strong man fully armed [ from his courtyard] guards his own dwelling his belongings are undisturbed [his property is at peace and is secure].
Luke,11,22,But when one stronger than he attacks him and conquers him he robs him of his whole armor on which he had relied and divides up and distributes all his goods as plunder (spoil).
Luke,11,23,He who is not with Me [siding and believing with Me] is against Me and he who does not gather with Me [engage in My interest] scatters.
Luke,11,24,When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it roams through waterless places in search [of a place] of rest (release refreshment ease); and finding none it says I will go back to my house from which I came.
Luke,11,25,And when it arrives it finds [the place] swept and put in order and furnished and decorated.
Luke,11,26,And it goes and brings other spirits seven [of them] more evil than itself and they enter in settle down and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.
Luke,11,27,Now it occurred that as He was saying these things a certain woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him Blessed (happy and to be envied) is the womb that bore You and the breasts that You sucked!
Luke,11,28,But He said Blessed (happy and to be envied) rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey and practice it!
Luke,11,29,Now as the crowds were [increasingly] thronging Him He began to say This present generation is a wicked one; it seeks and demands a sign (miracle) but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah [the prophet].
Luke,11,30,For [just] as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh so will also the Son of Man be [a sign] to this age and generation.
Luke,11,31,The queen of the South will arise in the judgment with the people of this age and generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the [inhabited] earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon and notice here is more than Solomon. [I Kings 10:1-13; II Chron. 9:1-12.]
Luke,11,32,The men of Nineveh will appear as witnesses at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold here is more than Jonah.
Luke,11,33,No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or crypt or under a bushel measure but on a lampstand that those who are coming in may see the light.
Luke,11,34,Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye ( your conscience) is sound and fulfilling its office your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound and is not fulfilling its office your body is full of darkness.
Luke,11,35,Be careful therefore that the light that is in you is not darkness.
Luke,11,36,If then your entire body is illuminated having no part dark it will be wholly bright [with light] as when a lamp with its bright rays gives you light.
Luke,11,37,Now while Jesus was speaking a Pharisee invited Him to take dinner with him so He entered and reclined at table.
Luke,11,38,The Pharisee noticed and was astonished [to see] that Jesus did not first wash before dinner.
Luke,11,39,But the Lord said to him Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside you yourselves are full of greed and robbery and extortion and malice and wickedness.
Luke,11,40,You senseless (foolish stupid) ones [acting without reflection or intelligence]! Did not He Who made the outside make the inside also?
Luke,11,41,But [dedicate your inner self and] give as donations to the poor of those things which are within [of inward righteousness] and behold everything is purified and clean for you.
Luke,11,42,But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every [little] herb but disregard and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone.
Luke,11,43,Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and [you love] to be greeted and bowed down to in the [public] marketplaces.
Luke,11,44,Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not marked or seen and men walk over them without being aware of it [and are ceremonially defiled].
Luke,11,45,One of the experts in the [Mosaic] Law answered Him Teacher in saying this You reproach and outrage and affront even us!
Luke,11,46,But He said Woe to you the lawyers also! For you load men with oppressive burdens hard to bear and you do not personally [even gently] touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke,11,47,Woe to you! For you are rebuilding and repairing the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed (destroyed).
Luke,11,48,So you bear witness and give your full approval and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they actually killed them and you rebuild and repair monuments to them.
Luke,11,49,For this reason also the wisdom of God said I will send them prophets and apostles [some] of whom they will put to death and persecute
Luke,11,50,So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against and required of this age and generation
Luke,11,51,From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes I tell you it shall be charged against and required of this age and generation.
Luke,11,52,Woe to you lawyers (experts in the Mosaic Law)! For you have taken away the key to knowledge; you did not go in yourselves and you hindered and prevented those who were entering.
Luke,11,53,As He left there the scribes and the Pharisees [followed Him closely and they] began to be enraged with and set themselves violently against Him and to draw Him out and provoke Him to speak of many things
Luke,11,54,Secretly watching and plotting and lying in wait for Him to seize upon something He might say [that they might accuse Him].
Luke,12,1,IN THE meanwhile when so many thousands of the people had gathered that they were trampling on one another Jesus commenced by saying primarily to His disciples Be on your guard against the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy [producing unrest and violent agitation].
Luke,12,2,Nothing is [so closely] covered up that it will not be revealed or hidden that it will not be known.
Luke,12,3,Whatever you have spoken in the darkness shall be heard and listened to in the light and what you have whispered in [people's] ears and behind closed doors will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke,12,4,I tell you My friends do not dread and be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do.
Luke,12,5,But I will warn you whom you should fear: fear Him Who after killing has power to hurl into hell (Gehenna); yes I say to you fear Him!
Luke,12,6,Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And [yet] not one of them is forgotten or uncared for in the presence of God.
Luke,12,7,But [even] the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be struck with fear or seized with alarm; you are of greater worth than many [flocks] of sparrows.
Luke,12,8,And I tell you Whoever declares openly [speaking out freely] and confesses that he is My worshiper and acknowledges Me before men the Son of Man also will declare and confess and acknowledge him before the angels of God.
Luke,12,9,But he who disowns and denies and rejects and refuses to acknowledge Me before men will be disowned and denied and rejected and refused acknowledgement in the presence of the angels of God.
Luke,12,10,And everyone who makes a statement or speaks a word against the Son of Man it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [that is whoever intentionally comes short of the reverence due the Holy Spirit] it will not be forgiven him [for him there is no forgiveness].
Luke,12,11,And when they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities do not be anxious [beforehand] how you shall reply in defense or what you are to say.
Luke,12,12,For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour and moment what [you] ought to say.
Luke,12,13,Someone from the crowd said to Him Master order my brother to divide the inheritance and share it with me.
Luke,12,14,But He told him Man who has appointed Me a judge or umpire and divider over you?
Luke,12,15,And He said to them Guard yourselves and keep free from all covetousness (the immoderate desire for wealth the greedy longing to have more); for a man's life does not consist in and is not derived from possessing overflowing abundance or that which is over and above his needs.
Luke,12,16,Then He told them a parable saying The land of a rich man was fertile and yielded plentifully.
Luke,12,17,And he considered and debated within himself What shall I do? I have no place [in which] to gather together my harvest.
Luke,12,18,And he said I will do this: I will pull down my storehouses and build larger ones and there I will store all my grain or produce and my goods.
Luke,12,19,And I will say to my soul Soul you have many good things laid up [enough] for many years. Take your ease; eat drink and enjoy yourself merrily.
Luke,12,20,But God said to him You fool! This very night they [the messengers of God] will demand your soul of you; and all the things that you have prepared whose will they be?
Luke,12,21,So it is with the one who continues to lay up and hoard possessions for himself and is not rich [in his relation] to God [this is how he fares].
Luke,12,22,And [Jesus] said to His disciples Therefore I tell you do not be anxious and troubled [with cares] about your life as to what you will [have to] eat; or about your body as to what you will [have to] wear.
Luke,12,23,For life is more than food and the body [more] than clothes.
Luke,12,24,Observe and consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap they have neither storehouse nor barn; and [yet] God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you than the birds!
Luke,12,25,And which of you by being overly anxious and troubled with cares can add a cubit to his stature or a moment [unit] of time to his age [the length of his life]?
Luke,12,26,If then you are not able to do such a little thing as that why are you anxious and troubled with cares about the rest?
Luke,12,27,Consider the lilies how they grow. They neither [wearily] toil nor spin nor weave; yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory (his splendor and magnificence) was not arrayed like one of these. [I Kings 10:4-7.]
Luke,12,28,But if God so clothes the grass in the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace how much more will He clothe you O you [people] of little faith?
Luke,12,29,And you do not seek [by meditating and reasoning to inquire into] what you are to eat and what you are to drink; nor be of anxious (troubled) mind [ unsettled excited worried and in suspense];
Luke,12,30,For all the pagan world is [greedily] seeking these things and your Father knows that you need them.
Luke,12,31,Only aim at and strive for and seek His kingdom and all these things shall be supplied to you also.
Luke,12,32,Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear little flock for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom!
Luke,12,33,Sell what you possess and give donations to the poor; provide yourselves with purses and handbags that do not grow old an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
Luke,12,34,For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.
Luke,12,35,Keep your loins girded and your lamps burning
Luke,12,36,And be like men who are waiting for their master to return home from the marriage feast so that when he returns from the wedding and comes and knocks they may open to him immediately.
Luke,12,37,Blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) are those servants whom the master finds awake and alert and watching when he comes. Truly I say to you he will gird himself and have them recline at table and will come and serve them!
Luke,12,38,If he comes in the second watch (before midnight) or the third watch (after midnight) and finds them so blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) are those servants!
Luke,12,39,But of this be assured: if the householder had known at what time the burglar was coming he would have been awake and alert and watching and would not have permitted his house to be dug through and broken into.
Luke,12,40,You also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming at an hour and a moment when you do not anticipate it.
Luke,12,41,Peter said Lord are You telling this parable for us or for all alike?
Luke,12,42,And the Lord said Who then is that faithful steward the wise man whom his master will set over those in his household service to supply them their allowance of food at the appointed time?
Luke,12,43,Blessed (happy and to be envied) is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he arrives.
Luke,12,44,Truly I tell you he will set him in charge over all his possessions.
Luke,12,45,But if that servant says in his heart My master is late in coming and begins to strike the menservants and the maids and to eat and drink and get drunk
Luke,12,46,The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he does not know and will punish him and cut him off and assign his lot with the unfaithful.
Luke,12,47,And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act as he would wish him to act shall be beaten with many [lashes].
Luke,12,48,But he who did not know and did things worthy of a beating shall be beaten with few [lashes]. For everyone to whom much is given of him shall much be required; and of him to whom men entrust much they will require and demand all the more.
Luke,12,49,I have come to cast fire upon the earth and how I wish that it were already kindled!
Luke,12,50,I have a baptism with which to be baptized and how greatly and sorely I am urged on (impelled constrained) until it is accomplished!
Luke,12,51,Do you suppose that I have come to give peace upon earth? No I say to you but rather division;
Luke,12,52,For from now on in one house there will be five divided [among themselves] three against two and two against three.
Luke,12,53,They will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
Luke,12,54,He also said to the crowds of people When you see a cloud rising in the west at once you say It is going to rain! And so it does.
Luke,12,55,And when [you see that] a south wind is blowing you say There will be severe heat! And it occurs.
Luke,12,56,You playactors (hypocrites)! You know how [intelligently] to discern and interpret and prove the looks of the earth and sky; but how is it that you do not know how to discern and interpret and apply the proof to this present time?
Luke,12,57,And why do you not judge what is just and personally decide what is right?
Luke,12,58,Then as you go with your accuser before a magistrate on the way make a diligent effort to settle and be quit (free) of him lest he drag you to the judge and the judge turn you over to the officer and the officer put you in prison.
Luke,12,59,I tell you you will never get out until you have paid the very last [fraction of a] cent.
Luke,13,1,JUST AT that time there [arrived] some people who informed Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Luke,13,2,And He replied by saying to them Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans because they have suffered in this way?
Luke,13,3,I tell you No; but unless you repent ( change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways with abhorrence of your past sins) you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally.
Luke,13,4,Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them--do you think that they were more guilty offenders (debtors) than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem?
Luke,13,5,I tell you No; but unless you repent ( change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways with abhorrence of your past sins) you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally.
Luke,13,6,And He told them this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it but did not find [any].
Luke,13,7,So he said to the vinedresser See here! For these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue also to use up the ground [to deplete the soil intercept the sun and take up room]?
Luke,13,8,But he replied to him Leave it alone sir [just] this one more year till I dig around it and put manure [on the soil].
Luke,13,9,Then perhaps it will bear fruit after this; but if not you can cut it down and out.
Luke,13,10,Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke,13,11,And there was a woman there who for eighteen years had had an infirmity caused by a spirit ( a demon of sickness). She was bent completely forward and utterly unable to straighten herself up or to look upward.
Luke,13,12,And when Jesus saw her He called [her to Him] and said to her Woman you are released from your infirmity!
Luke,13,13,Then He laid [His] hands on her and instantly she was made straight and she recognized and thanked and praised God.
Luke,13,14,But the leader of the synagogue indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath said to the crowd There are six days on which work ought to be done; so come on those days and be cured and not on the Sabbath day.
Luke,13,15,But the Lord replied to him saying You playactors (hypocrites)! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it out to water it?
Luke,13,16,And ought not this woman a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?
Luke,13,17,Even as He said this all His opponents were put to shame and all the people were rejoicing over all the glorious things that were being done by Him.
Luke,13,18,This led Him to say What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?
Luke,13,19,It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and planted in his own garden; and it grew and became a tree and the wild birds found shelter and roosted and nested in its branches.
Luke,13,20,And again He said To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke,13,21,It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour or meal until it was all leavened (fermented).
Luke,13,22,[Jesus] journeyed on through towns and villages teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem.
Luke,13,23,And someone asked Him Lord will only a few be saved (rescued delivered from the penalties of the last judgment and made partakers of the salvation by Christ)? And He said to them
Luke,13,24,Strive to enter by the narrow door [force yourselves through it] for many I tell you will try to enter and will not be able.
Luke,13,25,When once the Master of the house gets up and closes the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door [again and again] saying Lord open to us! He will answer you I do not know where [ what household--certainly not Mine] you come from.
Luke,13,26,Then you will begin to say We ate and drank in Your presence and You taught in our streets.
Luke,13,27,But He will say I tell you I do not know where [ what household--certainly not Mine] you come from; depart from Me all you wrongdoers!
Luke,13,28,There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves being cast forth (banished driven away).
Luke,13,29,And [people] will come from east and west and from north and south and sit down (feast at table) in the kingdom of God.
Luke,13,30,And behold there are some [now] last who will be first [then] and there are some [now] first who will be last [then].
Luke,13,31,At that very hour some Pharisees came up and said to Him Go away from here for Herod is determined to kill You.
Luke,13,32,And He said to them Go and tell that fox [sly and crafty skulking and cowardly] Behold I drive out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow and on the third day I finish (complete) My course.
Luke,13,33,Nevertheless I must continue on My way today and tomorrow and the day after that--for it will never do for a prophet to be destroyed away from Jerusalem!
Luke,13,34,O Jerusalem Jerusalem you who continue to kill the prophets and to stone those who are sent to you! How often I have desired and yearned to gather your children together [around Me] as a hen [gathers] her young under her wings but you would not!
Luke,13,35,Behold your house is forsaken (abandoned left to you destitute of God's help)! And I tell you you will not see Me again until the time comes when you shall say Blessed (to be celebrated with praises) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord!
Luke,14,1,IT OCCURRED one Sabbath when [Jesus] went for a meal at the house of one of the ruling Pharisees that they were [engaged in] watching Him [closely].
Luke,14,2,And behold [just] in front of Him there was a man who had dropsy.
Luke,14,3,And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees Is it lawful and right to cure on the Sabbath or not?
Luke,14,4,But they kept silent. Then He took hold [of the man] and cured him and sent him away.
Luke,14,5,And He said to them Which of you having a son or a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a well will not at once pull him out on the Sabbath day?
Luke,14,6,And they were unable to reply to this.
Luke,14,7,Now He told a parable to those who were invited [when] He noticed how they were selecting the places of honor saying to them
Luke,14,8,When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast do not recline on the chief seat [in the place of honor] lest a more distinguished person than you has been invited by him
Luke,14,9,And he who invited both of you will come to you and say Let this man have the place [you have taken]. Then with humiliation and a guilty sense of impropriety you will begin to take the lowest place.
Luke,14,10,But when you are invited go and recline in the lowest place so that when your host comes in he may say to you Friend go up higher! Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit [at table] with you.
Luke,14,11,For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled (ranked below others who are honored or rewarded) and he who humbles himself (keeps a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly) will be exalted (elevated in rank).
Luke,14,12,Jesus also said to the man who had invited Him When you give a dinner or a supper do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors lest perhaps they also invite you in return and so you are paid back.
Luke,14,13,But when you give a banquet or a reception invite the poor the disabled the lame and the blind.
Luke,14,14,Then you will be blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) because they have no way of repaying you and you will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just (upright).
Luke,14,15,When one of those who reclined [at the table] with Him heard this he said to Him Blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!
Luke,14,16,But Jesus said to him A man was once giving a great supper and invited many;
Luke,14,17,And at the hour for the supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited Come for all is now ready.
Luke,14,18,But they all alike began to make excuses and to beg off. The first said to him I have bought a piece of land and I have to go out and see it; I beg you have me excused.
Luke,14,19,And another said I have bought five yoke of oxen and I am going to examine and put my approval on them; I beg you have me excused.
Luke,14,20,And another said I have married a wife and because of this I am unable to come.
Luke,14,21,So the servant came and reported these [answers] to his master. Then the master of the house said in wrath to his servant Go quickly into the great streets and the small streets of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame.
Luke,14,22,And the servant [returning] said Sir what you have commanded me to do has been done and yet there is room.
Luke,14,23,Then the master said to the servant Go out into the highways and hedges and urge and constrain [them] to yield and come in so that my house may be filled.
Luke,14,24,For I tell you not one of those who were invited shall taste my supper.
Luke,14,25,Now huge crowds were going along with [Jesus] and He turned and said to them
Luke,14,26,If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his [own] father and mother [ in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God] and [likewise] his wife and children and brothers and sisters--[yes] and even his own life also--he cannot be My disciple.
Luke,14,27,Whoever does not persevere and carry his own cross and come after (follow) Me cannot be My disciple.
Luke,14,28,For which of you wishing to build a farm building does not first sit down and calculate the cost [to see] whether he has sufficient means to finish it?
Luke,14,29,Otherwise when he has laid the foundation and is unable to complete [the building] all who see it will begin to mock and jeer at him
Luke,14,30,Saying This man began to build and was not able ( worth enough) to finish.
Luke,14,31,Or what king going out to engage in conflict with another king will not first sit down and consider and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand [men] to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
Luke,14,32,And if he cannot [do so] when the other king is still a great way off he sends an envoy and asks the terms of peace.
Luke,14,33,So then any of you who does not forsake (renounce surrender claim to give up say good-bye to) all that he has cannot be My disciple.
Luke,14,34,Salt is good [an excellent thing] but if salt has lost its strength and has become saltless (insipid flat) how shall its saltness be restored?
Luke,14,35,It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap; men throw it away. He who has ears to hear let him listen and consider and comprehend by hearing!
Luke,15,1,NOW THE tax collectors and [notorious and especially wicked] sinners were all coming near to [Jesus] to listen to Him.
Luke,15,2,And the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering and indignantly complaining saying This man accepts and receives and welcomes [ preeminently wicked] sinners and eats with them.
Luke,15,3,So He told them this parable:
Luke,15,4,What man of you if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness (desert) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?
Luke,15,5,And when he has found it he lays it on his [own] shoulders rejoicing.
Luke,15,6,And when he gets home he summons together [his] friends and [his] neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me because I have found my sheep which was lost.
Luke,15,7,Thus I tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one [ especially] wicked person who repents ( changes his mind abhorring his errors and misdeeds and determines to enter upon a better course of life) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance.
Luke,15,8,Or what woman having ten [silver] drachmas [each one equal to a day's wages] if she loses one coin does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it?
Luke,15,9,And when she has found it she summons her [women] friends and neighbors saying Rejoice with me for I have found the silver coin which I had lost.
Luke,15,10,Even so I tell you there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [ especially] wicked person who repents ( changes his mind for the better heartily amending his ways with abhorrence of his past sins).
Luke,15,11,And He said There was a certain man who had two sons;
Luke,15,12,And the younger of them said to his father Father give me the part of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided the estate between them.
Luke,15,13,And not many days after that the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [from restraint] living.
Luke,15,14,And when he had spent all he had a mighty famine came upon that country and he began to fall behind and be in want.
Luke,15,15,So he went and forced (glued) himself upon one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed hogs.
Luke,15,16,And he would gladly have fed on and filled his belly with the carob pods that the hogs were eating but [they could not satisfy his hunger and] nobody gave him anything [better].
Luke,15,17,Then when he came to himself he said How many hired servants of my father have enough food and [even food] to spare but I am perishing (dying) here of hunger!
Luke,15,18,I will get up and go to my father and I will say to him Father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
Luke,15,19,I am no longer worthy to be called your son; [just] make me like one of your hired servants.
Luke,15,20,So he got up and came to his [own] father. But while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [for him]; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [ fervently].
Luke,15,21,And the son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours]!
Luke,15,22,But the father said to his bond servants Bring quickly the best robe (the festive robe of honor) and put it on him; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet.
Luke,15,23,And bring out that [wheat-]fattened calf and kill it; and let us revel and feast and be happy and make merry
Luke,15,24,Because this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found! And they began to revel and feast and make merry.
Luke,15,25,But his older son was in the field; and as he returned and came near the house he heard music and dancing.
Luke,15,26,And having called one of the servant [boys] to him he began to ask what this meant.
Luke,15,27,And he said to him Your brother has come and your father has killed that [wheat-]fattened calf because he has received him back safe and well.
Luke,15,28,But [the elder brother] was angry [with deep-seated wrath] and resolved not to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him
Luke,15,29,But he answered his father Look! These many years I have served you and I have never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me [so much as] a [little] kid that I might revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends;
Luke,15,30,But when this son of yours arrived who has devoured your estate with immoral women you have killed for him that [wheat-] fattened calf!
Luke,15,31,And the father said to him Son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours.
Luke,15,32,But it was fitting to make merry to revel and feast and rejoice for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!
Luke,16,1,ALSO [Jesus] said to the disciples There was a certain rich man who had a manager of his estate and accusations [against this man] were brought to him that he was squandering his [master's] possessions.
Luke,16,2,And he called him and said to him What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management [of my affairs] for you can be [my] manager no longer.
Luke,16,3,And the manager of the estate said to himself What shall I do seeing that my master is taking the management away from me? I am not able to dig and I am ashamed to beg.
Luke,16,4,I have come to know what I will do so that they [my master's debtors] may accept and welcome me into their houses when I am put out of the management.
Luke,16,5,So he summoned his master's debtors one by one and he said to the first How much do you owe my master?
Luke,16,6,He said A hundred measures [about 900 gallons] of oil. And he said to him Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation and sit down quickly and write fifty [about 450 gallons].
Luke,16,7,After that he said to another And how much do you owe? He said A hundred measures [about 900 bushels] of wheat. He said to him Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation and write eighty [about 700 bushels].
Luke,16,8,And [his] master praised the dishonest (unjust) manager for acting shrewdly and prudently; for the sons of this age are shrewder and more prudent and wiser in [ relation to] their own generation [to their own age and kind] than are the sons of light.
Luke,16,9,And I tell you make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon ( deceitful riches money possessions) so that when it fails they [those you have favored] may receive and welcome you into the everlasting habitations (dwellings).
Luke,16,10,He who is faithful in a very little [thing] is faithful also in much and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little [thing] is dishonest and unjust also in much.
Luke,16,11,Therefore if you have not been faithful in the [case of] unrighteous mammon ( deceitful riches money possessions) who will entrust to you the true riches?
Luke,16,12,And if you have not proved faithful in that which belongs to another [whether God or man] who will give you that which is your own [that is the true riches]?
Luke,16,13,No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon (riches or anything in which you trust and on which you rely).
Luke,16,14,Now the Pharisees who were covetous and lovers of money heard all these things [taken together] and they began to sneer at and ridicule and scoff at Him.
Luke,16,15,But He said to them You are the ones who declare yourselves just and upright before men but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted and highly thought of among men is detestable and abhorrent (an abomination) in the sight of God. [I Sam. 16:7; Prov. 21:2.]
Luke,16,16,Until John came there were the Law and the Prophets; since then the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God is being preached and everyone strives violently to go in [would force his own way rather than God's way into it].
Luke,16,17,Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to fail and become void.
Luke,16,18,Whoever divorces (dismisses and repudiates) his wife and marries another commits adultery and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.
Luke,16,19,There was a certain rich man who [habitually] clothed himself in purple and fine linen and reveled and feasted and made merry in splendor every day.
Luke,16,20,And at his gate there was [carelessly] dropped down and left a certain utterly destitute man named Lazarus [reduced to begging alms and] covered with [ ulcerated] sores.
Luke,16,21,He [eagerly] desired to be satisfied with what fell from the rich man's table; moreover the dogs even came and licked his sores.
Luke,16,22,And it occurred that the man [reduced to] begging died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.
Luke,16,23,And in Hades (the realm of the dead) being in torment he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke,16,24,And he cried out and said Father Abraham have pity and mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am in anguish in this flame.
Luke,16,25,But Abraham said Child remember that you in your lifetime fully received [what is due you in] comforts and delights and Lazarus in like manner the discomforts and distresses; but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish.
Luke,16,26,And besides all this between us and you a great chasm has been fixed in order that those who want to pass from this [place] to you may not be able and no one may pass from there to us.
Luke,16,27,And [the man] said Then father I beseech you to send him to my father's house--
Luke,16,28,For I have five brothers--so that he may give [solemn] testimony and warn them lest they too come into this place of torment.
Luke,16,29,But Abraham said They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear and listen to them.
Luke,16,30,But he answered No father Abraham but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent ( change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways with abhorrence of their past sins).
Luke,16,31,He said to him If they do not hear and listen to Moses and the Prophets neither will they be persuaded and convinced and believe [even] if someone should rise from the dead.
Luke,17,1,AND [Jesus] said to His disciples Temptations (snares traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come but woe to him by or through whom they come!
Luke,17,2,It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare to one of these little ones [ lowly in rank or influence].
Luke,17,3,Pay attention and always be on your guard [looking out for one another]. If your brother sins (misses the mark) solemnly tell him so and reprove him and if he repents (feels sorry for having sinned) forgive him.
Luke,17,4,And even if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns to you seven times and says I repent [I am sorry] you must forgive him (give up resentment and consider the offense as recalled and annulled).
Luke,17,5,The apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith (that trust and confidence that spring from our belief in God).
Luke,17,6,And the Lord answered If you had faith (trust and confidence in God) even [so small] like a grain of mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea and it would obey you.
Luke,17,7,Will any man of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep say to him when he has come in from the field Come at once and take your place at the table?
Luke,17,8,Will he not instead tell him Get my supper ready and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; then afterward you yourself shall eat and drink?
Luke,17,9,Is he grateful and does he praise the servant because he did what he was ordered to do?
Luke,17,10,Even so on your part when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you say We are unworthy servants [possessing no merit for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have [merely] done what was our duty to do.
Luke,17,11,As He went on His way to Jerusalem it occurred that [Jesus] was passing [along the border] between Samaria and Galilee.
Luke,17,12,And as He was going into one village He was met by ten lepers who stood at a distance.
Luke,17,13,And they raised up their voices and called Jesus Master take pity and have mercy on us!
Luke,17,14,And when He saw them He said to them Go [at once] and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went they were cured and made clean.
Luke,17,15,Then one of them upon seeing that he was cured turned back recognizing and thanking and praising God with a loud voice;
Luke,17,16,And he fell prostrate at Jesus' feet thanking Him [over and over]. And he was a Samaritan.
Luke,17,17,Then Jesus asked Were not [all] ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
Luke,17,18,Was there no one found to return and to recognize and give thanks and praise to God except this alien?
Luke,17,19,And He said to him Get up and go on your way. Your faith (your trust and confidence that spring from your belief in God) has restored you to health.
Luke,17,20,Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come He replied to them by saying The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed or with visible display
Luke,17,21,Nor will people say Look! Here [it is]! or See [it is] there! For behold the kingdom of God is within you [in your hearts] and among you [surrounding you].
Luke,17,22,And He said to the disciples The time is coming when you will long to see [even] one of the days of the Son of Man and you will not see [it].
Luke,17,23,And they will say to you Look! [He is] there! or Look! [He is] here! But do not go out or follow [them].
Luke,17,24,For like the lightning that flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other so will the Son of Man be in His [own] day.
Luke,17,25,But first He must suffer many things and be disapproved and repudiated and rejected by this age and generation.
Luke,17,26,And [just] as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the time of the Son of Man.
Luke,17,27,[People] ate they drank they married they were given in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.
Luke,17,28,So also [it was the same] as it was in the days of Lot. [People] ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they built;
Luke,17,29,But on the [very] day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [them] all.
Luke,17,30,That is the way it will be on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,On that day let him who is on the housetop with his belongings in the house not come down [and go inside] to carry them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back.
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot's wife!
Luke,17,33,Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it but whoever loses his life will preserve and quicken it.
Luke,17,34,I tell you in that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke,17,35,There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke,17,36,Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke,17,37,Then they asked Him Where Lord? He said to them Wherever the dead body is there will the vultures or eagles be gathered together.
Luke,18,1,ALSO [Jesus] told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not to turn coward (faint lose heart and give up).
Luke,18,2,He said In a certain city there was a judge who neither reverenced and feared God nor respected or considered man.
Luke,18,3,And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying Protect and defend and give me justice against my adversary.
Luke,18,4,And for a time he would not; but later he said to himself Though I have neither reverence or fear for God nor respect or consideration for man
Luke,18,5,Yet because this widow continues to bother me I will defend and protect and avenge her lest she give me intolerable annoyance and wear me out by her continual coming or at the last she come and rail on me or assault me or strangle me.
Luke,18,6,Then the Lord said Listen to what the unjust judge says!
Luke,18,7,And will not [our just] God defend and protect and avenge His elect (His chosen ones) who cry to Him day and night? Will He defer them and delay help on their behalf?
Luke,18,8,I tell you He will defend and protect and avenge them speedily. However when the Son of Man comes will He find [ persistence in] faith on the earth?
Luke,18,9,He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves and were confident that they were righteous [that they were upright and in right standing with God] and scorned and made nothing of all the rest of men:
Luke,18,10,Two men went up into the temple [ enclosure] to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
Luke,18,11,The Pharisee took his stand ostentatiously and began to pray thus before and with himself: God I thank You that I am not like the rest of men--extortioners (robbers) swindlers [unrighteous in heart and life] adulterers--or even like this tax collector here.
Luke,18,12,I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I gain.
Luke,18,13,But the tax collector [merely] standing at a distance would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but kept striking his breast saying O God be favorable (be gracious be merciful) to me the especially wicked sinner that I am!
Luke,18,14,I tell you this man went down to his home justified (forgiven and made upright and in right standing with God) rather than the other man; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Luke,18,15,Now they were also bringing [even] babies to Him that He might touch them and when the disciples noticed it they reproved them.
Luke,18,16,But Jesus called them [ the parents] to Him saying Allow the little children to come to Me and do not hinder them for to such [as these] belongs the kingdom of God.
Luke,18,17,Truly I say to you whoever does not accept and receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [does] shall not in any way enter it [at all].
Luke,18,18,And a certain ruler asked Him Good Teacher [You who are essentially and perfectly morally good] what shall I do to inherit eternal life [to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?
Luke,18,19,Jesus said to him Why do you call Me [ essentially and perfectly morally] good? No one is [ essentially and perfectly morally] good--except God only.
Luke,18,20,You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not witness falsely honor your father and your mother.
Luke,18,21,And he replied All these I have kept from my youth.
Luke,18,22,And when Jesus heard it He said to him One thing you still lack. Sell everything that you have and divide [the money] among the poor and you will have [rich] treasure in heaven; and come back [and] follow Me [become My disciple join My party and accompany Me].
Luke,18,23,But when he heard this he became distressed and very sorrowful for he was rich--exceedingly so.
Luke,18,24,Jesus observing him said How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!
Luke,18,25,For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than [for] a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
Luke,18,26,And those who heard it said Then who can be saved?
Luke,18,27,But He said What is impossible with men is possible with God.
Luke,18,28,And Peter said See we have left our own [things--home family and business] and have followed You.
Luke,18,29,And He said to them I say to you truly there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
Luke,18,30,Who will not receive in return many times more in this world and in the coming age eternal life.
Luke,18,31,Then taking the Twelve [apostles] aside He said to them Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem and all things that are written about the Son of Man through and by the prophets will be fulfilled.
Luke,18,32,For He will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be made sport of and scoffed and jeered at and insulted and spit upon.
Luke,18,33,They will flog Him and kill Him; and on the third day He will rise again.
Luke,18,34,But they understood nothing of these things; His words were a mystery and hidden from them and they did not comprehend what He was telling them.
Luke,18,35,As He came near to Jericho it occurred that a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
Luke,18,36,And hearing a crowd going by he asked what it meant.
Luke,18,37,They told him Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.
Luke,18,38,And he shouted saying Jesus Son of David take pity and have mercy on me!
Luke,18,39,But those who were in front reproved him telling him to keep quiet; yet he screamed and shrieked so much the more Son of David take pity and have mercy on me!
Luke,18,40,Then Jesus stood still and ordered that he be led to Him; and when he came near Jesus asked him
Luke,18,41,What do you want Me to do for you? He said Lord let me receive my sight!
Luke,18,42,And Jesus said to him Receive your sight! Your faith ( your trust and confidence that spring from your faith in God) has healed you.
Luke,18,43,And instantly he received his sight and began to follow Jesus recognizing praising and honoring God; and all the people when they saw it praised God.
Luke,19,1,AND [Jesus] entered Jericho and was passing through it.
Luke,19,2,And there was a man called Zacchaeus a chief tax collector and [he was] rich.
Luke,19,3,And he was trying to see Jesus which One He was but he could not on account of the crowd because he was small in stature.
Luke,19,4,So he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him for He was about to pass that way.
Luke,19,5,And when Jesus reached the place He looked up and said to him Zacchaeus hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.
Luke,19,6,So he hurried and came down and he received and welcomed Him joyfully.
Luke,19,7,And when the people saw it they all muttered among themselves and indignantly complained He has gone in to be the guest of and lodge with a man who is devoted to sin and preeminently a sinner.
Luke,19,8,So then Zacchaeus stood up and solemnly declared to the Lord See Lord the half of my goods I [now] give [by way of restoration] to the poor and if I have cheated anyone out of anything I [now] restore four times as much.
Luke,19,9,And Jesus said to him Today is [ Messianic and spiritual] salvation come to [all the members of] this household since Zacchaeus too is a [real spiritual] son of Abraham;
Luke,19,10,For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke,19,11,Now as they were listening to these things He proceeded to tell a parable because He was approaching Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be brought to light and shown forth immediately.
Luke,19,12,He therefore said A certain nobleman went into a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then to return.
Luke,19,13,Calling ten of his [own] bond servants he gave them ten minas [each equal to about one hundred days' wages or nearly twenty dollars] and said to them Buy and sell with these while I go and then return.
Luke,19,14,But his citizens detested him and sent an embassy after him to say We do not want this man to become ruler over us.
Luke,19,15,When he returned after having received the kingdom he ordered these bond servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know how much each one had made by buying and selling.
Luke,19,16,The first one came before him and he said Lord your mina has made ten [additional] minas.
Luke,19,17,And he said to him Well done excellent bond servant! Because you have been faithful and trustworthy in a very little [thing] you shall have authority over ten cities.
Luke,19,18,The second one also came and said Lord your mina has made five more minas.
Luke,19,19,And he said also to him And you will take charge over five cities.
Luke,19,20,Then another came and said Lord here is your mina which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief.
Luke,19,21,For I was [constantly] afraid of you because you are a stern (hard severe) man; you pick up what you did not lay down and you reap what you did not sow.
Luke,19,22,He said to the servant I will judge and condemn you out of your own mouth you wicked slave! You knew [did you] that I was a stern (hard severe) man picking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?
Luke,19,23,Then why did you not put my money in a bank so that on my return I might have collected it with interest?
Luke,19,24,And he said to the bystanders Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas.
Luke,19,25,And they said to him Lord he has ten minas [already]!
Luke,19,26,And [said Jesus] I tell you that to everyone who gets and has will more be given but from the man who does not get and does not have even what he has will be taken away.
Luke,19,27,[The indignant king ended by saying] But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them--bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!
Luke,19,28,And after saying these things Jesus went on ahead of them going up to Jerusalem.
Luke,19,29,When He came near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called [the Mount of] Olives He sent two of His disciples
Luke,19,30,Telling [them] Go into the village yonder; there as you go in you will find a donkey's colt tied on which no man has ever yet sat. Loose it and bring [it here].
Luke,19,31,If anybody asks you Why are you untying [it]? you shall say this: Because the Lord has need of it.
Luke,19,32,So those who were sent went away and found it [just] as He had told them.
Luke,19,33,And as they were loosening the colt its owners said to them Why are you untying the colt?
Luke,19,34,And they said The Lord has need of it.
Luke,19,35,And they brought it to Jesus; then they threw their garments over the colt and set Jesus upon it.
Luke,19,36,And as He rode along the people kept spreading their garments on the road. [II Kings 9:13.]
Luke,19,37,As He was approaching [the city] at the descent of the Mount of Olives the whole crowd of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God [extolling Him exultantly and] loudly for all the mighty miracles and works of power that they had witnessed
Luke,19,38,Crying Blessed (celebrated with praises) is the King Who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven [ freedom there from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin] and glory (majesty and splendor) in the highest [heaven]!
Luke,19,39,And some of the Pharisees from the throng said to Jesus Teacher reprove Your disciples!
Luke,19,40,He replied I tell you that if these keep silent the very stones will cry out.
Luke,19,41,And as He approached He saw the city and He wept [ audibly] over it
Luke,19,42,Exclaiming Would that you had known personally even at least in this your day the things that make for peace (for freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin and upon which your peace--your security safety prosperity and happiness--depends)! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
Luke,19,43,For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will throw up a bank [with pointed stakes] about you and surround you and shut you in on every side.
Luke,19,44,And they will dash you down to the ground you [Jerusalem] and your children within you; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another [all] because you did not come progressively to recognize and know and understand [from observation and experience] the time of your visitation [that is when God was visiting you the time in which God showed Himself gracious toward you and offered you salvation through Christ].
Luke,19,45,Then He went into the temple [ enclosure] and began to drive out those who were selling
Luke,19,46,Telling them It is written My house shall be a house of prayer; but you have made it a cave of robbers.
Luke,19,47,And He continued to teach day after day in the temple [ porches and courts]. The chief priests and scribes and the leading men of the people were seeking to put Him to death
Luke,19,48,But they did not discover anything they could do for all the people hung upon His words and stuck by Him.
Luke,20,1,ONE DAY as Jesus was instructing the people in the temple [ porches] and preaching the good news (the Gospel) the chief priests and the scribes came up with the elders (members of the Sanhedrin)
Luke,20,2,And said to Him Tell us by what [sort of] authority You are doing these things? Or who is it who gave You this authority?
Luke,20,3,He replied to them I will also ask you a question. Now answer Me:
Luke,20,4,Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?
Luke,20,5,And they argued and discussed [it] and reasoned together with themselves saying If we reply From heaven He will say Why then did you not believe him?
Luke,20,6,But if we answer From men all the people will stone us to death for they are long since firmly convinced that John was a prophet.
Luke,20,7,So they replied that they did not know from where it came.
Luke,20,8,Then Jesus said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Luke,20,9,Then He began to relate to the people this parable ( this story to figuratively portray what He had to say): A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some vinedressers and went into another country for a long stay.
Luke,20,10,When the [right] season came he sent a bond servant to the tenants that they might give him [his part] of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat ( thrashed) him and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke,20,11,And he sent still another servant; him they also beat ( thrashed) and dishonored and insulted him disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke,20,12,And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and threw out [of the vineyard].
Luke,20,13,Then the owner of the vineyard said What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it is probable that they will respect him.
Luke,20,14,But when the tenants saw him they argued among themselves saying This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.
Luke,20,15,So they drove him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
Luke,20,16,He will come and [ utterly] put an end to those tenants and will give the vineyard to others. When they [the chief priests and the scribes and the elders] heard this they said May it never be!
Luke,20,17,But [Jesus] looked at them and said What then is [the meaning of] this that is written: The [very] Stone which the builders rejected has become the chief Stone of the corner [Cornerstone]?
Luke,20,18,Everyone who falls on that Stone will be broken [in pieces]; but upon whomever It falls It will crush him [winnow him and scatter him as dust].
Luke,20,19,The scribes and the chief priests desired and tried to find a way to arrest Him at that very hour but they were afraid of the people; for they discerned that He had related this parable against them.
Luke,20,20,So they watched [for an opportunity to ensnare] Him and sent spies who pretended to be upright (honest and sincere) that they might lay hold of something He might say so as to turn Him over to the control and authority of the governor.
Luke,20,21,They asked Him Teacher we know that You speak and teach what is right and that You show no partiality to anyone but teach the way of God honestly and in truth.
Luke,20,22,Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?
Luke,20,23,But He recognized and understood their cunning and unscrupulousness and said to them
Luke,20,24,Show Me a denarius (a coin)! Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered Caesar's.
Luke,20,25,He said to them Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.
Luke,20,26,So they could not in the presence of the people take hold of anything He said to turn it against Him; but marveling at His reply they were silent.
Luke,20,27,Also there came to Him some Sadducees those who say that there is no resurrection.
Luke,20,28,And they asked Him a question saying Teacher Moses wrote for us [a law] that if a man's brother dies leaving a wife and no children the man shall take the woman and raise up offspring for his brother.
Luke,20,29,Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died without [having any] children.
Luke,20,30,And the second
Luke,20,31,And then the third took her and in like manner all seven and they died leaving no children.
Luke,20,32,Last of all the woman died also.
Luke,20,33,Now in the resurrection whose wife will the woman be? For the seven married her.
Luke,20,34,And Jesus said to them The people of this world and present age marry and are given in marriage;
Luke,20,35,But those who are considered worthy to gain that other world and that future age and to attain to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage;
Luke,20,36,For they cannot die again but they are angel-like and equal to angels. And being sons of and sharers in the resurrection they are sons of God.
Luke,20,37,But that the dead are raised [ from death]--even Moses made known and showed in the passage concerning the [burning] bush where he calls the Lord The God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
Luke,20,38,Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living for to Him all men are alive [whether in the body or out of it] and they are alive [not dead] unto Him [in definite relationship to Him].
Luke,20,39,And some of the scribes replied Teacher you have spoken well and expertly [ so that there is no room for blame].
Luke,20,40,For they did not dare to question Him further.
Luke,20,41,But He asked them How can people say that the Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) is David's Son?
Luke,20,42,For David himself says in [the] Book of Psalms The Lord said to my Lord Sit at My right hand
Luke,20,43,Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
Luke,20,44,So David calls Him Lord; how then is He his Son?
Luke,20,45,And with all the people listening He said to His disciples
Luke,20,46,Beware of the scribes who like to walk about in long robes and love to be saluted [with honor] in places where people congregate and love the front and best seats in the synagogues and places of distinction at feasts
Luke,20,47,Who make away with and devour widows' houses and [to cover it up] with pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation (the heavier sentence the severer punishment).
Luke,21,1,LOOKING UP [Jesus] saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke,21,2,And He saw also a poor widow putting in two mites (copper coins).
Luke,21,3,And He said Truly I say to you this poor widow has put in more than all of them;
Luke,21,4,For they all gave out of their abundance (their surplus); but she has contributed out of her lack and her want putting in all that she had on which to live.
Luke,21,5,And as some were saying of the temple that it was decorated with handsome (shapely and magnificent) stones and consecrated offerings [ laid up to be kept] He said
Luke,21,6,As for all this that you [thoughtfully] look at the time will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.
Luke,21,7,And they asked Him Teacher when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is about to occur?
Luke,21,8,And He said Be on your guard and be careful that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name [ appropriating to themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me] saying I am He! and The time is at hand! Do not go out after them.
Luke,21,9,And when you hear of wars and insurrections (disturbances disorder and confusion) do not become alarmed and panic-stricken and terrified; for all this must take place first but the end will not [come] immediately.
Luke,21,10,Then He told them Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. [II Chron. 15:6; Isa. 19:2.]
Luke,21,11,There will be mighty and violent earthquakes and in various places famines and pestilences (plagues: malignant and contagious or infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating); and there will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven.
Luke,21,12,But previous to all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you turning you over to the synagogues and prisons and you will be led away before kings and governors for My name's sake.
Luke,21,13,This will be a time (an opportunity) for you to bear testimony.
Luke,21,14,Resolve and settle it in your minds not to meditate and prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense and how you will answer.
Luke,21,15,For I [Myself] will give you a mouth and such utterance and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against or refute.
Luke,21,16,You will be delivered up and betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends and [some] of you they will put to death.
Luke,21,17,And you will be hated (despised) by everyone because [you bear] My name and for its sake.
Luke,21,18,But not a hair of your head shall perish. [I Sam. 14:45.]
Luke,21,19,By your steadfastness and patient endurance you shall win the true life of your souls.
Luke,21,20,But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies then know and understand that its desolation has come near.
Luke,21,21,Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains and let those who are inside [the city] get out of it and let not those who are out in the country come into it;
Luke,21,22,For those are days of vengeance [of rendering full justice or satisfaction] that all things that are written may be fulfilled.
Luke,21,23,Alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have babies which they are nursing in those days! For great misery and anguish and distress shall be upon the land and indignation and punishment and retribution upon this people.
Luke,21,24,They will fall by the mouth and the edge of the sword and will be led away as captives to and among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (completed).
Luke,21,25,And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth [there will be] distress (trouble and anguish) of nations in bewilderment and perplexity [ without resources left wanting embarrassed in doubt not knowing which way to turn] at the roaring ( the echo) of the tossing of the sea
Luke,21,26,Men swooning away or expiring with fear and dread and apprehension and expectation of the things that are coming on the world; for the [very] powers of the heavens will be shaken and caused to totter.
Luke,21,27,And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great (transcendent and overwhelming) power and [all His kingly] glory (majesty and splendor).
Luke,21,28,Now when these things begin to occur look up and lift up your heads because your redemption (deliverance) is drawing near.
Luke,21,29,And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees;
Luke,21,30,When they put forth their buds and come out in leaf you see for yourselves and perceive and know that summer is already near.
Luke,21,31,Even so when you see these things taking place understand and know that the kingdom of God is at hand.
Luke,21,32,Truly I tell you this generation ( those living at that definite period of time) will not perish and pass away until all has taken place.
Luke,21,33,The sky and the earth ( the universe the world) will pass away but My words will not pass away.
Luke,21,34,But take heed to yourselves and be on your guard lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed (weighed down) with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence drunkenness and worldly worries and cares pertaining to [the business of] this life and [lest] that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose;
Luke,21,35,For it will come upon all who live upon the face of the entire earth.
Luke,21,36,Keep awake then and watch at all times [be discreet attentive and ready] praying that you may have the full strength and ability and be accounted worthy to escape all these things [taken together] that will take place and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.
Luke,21,37,Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [ the porches and courts of] the temple but at night He would go out and stay on the mount called Olivet.
Luke,21,38,And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple [ porches or courts] to listen to Him.
Luke,22,1,NOW THE Festival of Unleavened Bread was drawing near which is called the Passover.
Luke,22,2,And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [Jesus] for they feared the people.
Luke,22,3,But [then] Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot who was one of the Twelve [apostles].
Luke,22,4,And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him and deliver Him up to them.
Luke,22,5,And they were delighted and pledged [themselves] to give him money.
Luke,22,6,So he agreed [to this] and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [without an uprising] in the absence of the throng.
Luke,22,7,Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [lamb] had to be slain.
Luke,22,8,So Jesus sent Peter and John saying Go and prepare for us the Passover meal that we may eat it.
Luke,22,9,They said to Him Where do You want us to prepare [it]?
Luke,22,10,He said to them Behold when you have gone into the city a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters
Luke,22,11,And say to the master of the house The Teacher asks you Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover [meal] with My disciples?
Luke,22,12,And he will show you a large room upstairs furnished [with carpets and with couches properly spread]; there make [your] preparations.
Luke,22,13,And they went and found it [just] as He had said to them; and they made ready the Passover [supper].
Luke,22,14,And when the hour came [Jesus] reclined at table and the apostles with Him.
Luke,22,15,And He said to them I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
Luke,22,16,For I say to you I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke,22,17,And He took a cup and when He had given thanks He said Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves;
Luke,22,18,For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes.
Luke,22,19,Then He took a loaf [of bread] and when He had given thanks He broke [it] and gave it to them saying This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.
Luke,22,20,And in like manner He took the cup after supper saying This cup is the new testament or covenant [ratified] in My blood which is shed (poured out) for you.
Luke,22,21,But behold the hand of him who is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table.
Luke,22,22,For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up!
Luke,22,23,And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this.
Luke,22,24,Now an eager contention arose among them [as to] which of them was considered and reputed to be the greatest.
Luke,22,25,But Jesus said to them The kings of the Gentiles are deified by them and exercise lordship [ ruling as emperor-gods] over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers.
Luke,22,26,But this is not to be so with you; on the contrary let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves.
Luke,22,27,For who is the greater the one who reclines at table (the master) or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as One Who serves.
Luke,22,28,And you are those who have remained [throughout] and persevered with Me in My trials;
Luke,22,29,And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me so do I confer on you [the privilege and decree]
Luke,22,30,That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke,22,31,Simon Simon (Peter) listen! Satan has asked excessively that [all of] you be given up to him [out of the power and keeping of God] that he might sift [all of] you like grain
Luke,22,32,But I have prayed especially for you [Peter] that your [own] faith may not fail; and when you yourself have turned again strengthen and establish your brethren.
Luke,22,33,And [Simon Peter] said to Him Lord I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.
Luke,22,34,But Jesus said I tell you Peter before a [single] cock shall crow this day you will three times [utterly] deny that you know Me.
Luke,22,35,And He said to them When I sent you out with no purse or [provision] bag or sandals did you lack anything? They answered Nothing!
Luke,22,36,Then He said to them But now let him who has a purse take it and also [his provision] bag; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword.
Luke,22,37,For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted and classed among the wicked (the outlaws the criminals); for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [has reached its end and is finally settled].
Luke,22,38,And they said Look Lord! Here are two swords. And He said to them It is enough.
Luke,22,39,And He came out and went as was His habit to the Mount of Olives and the disciples also followed Him.
Luke,22,40,And when He came to the place He said to them Pray that you may not [at all] enter into temptation.
Luke,22,41,And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw and knelt down and prayed
Luke,22,42,Saying Father if You are willing remove this cup from Me; yet not My will but [ always] Yours be done.
Luke,22,43,And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven strengthening Him in spirit.
Luke,22,44,And being in an agony [of mind] He prayed [all the] more earnestly and intently and His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground.
Luke,22,45,And when He got up from prayer He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief
Luke,22,46,And He said to them Why do you sleep? Get up and pray that you may not enter [at all] into temptation.
Luke,22,47,And while He was still speaking behold there came a crowd and the man called Judas one of the Twelve [apostles] was going before [leading] them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him
Luke,22,48,But Jesus said to him Judas! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss?
Luke,22,49,And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen they said Lord shall we strike with the sword?
Luke,22,50,And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear the right one.
Luke,22,51,But Jesus said Permit them to go so far [as to seize Me]. And He touched the little (insignificant) ear and healed him.
Luke,22,52,Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him--the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin]--Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber?
Luke,22,53,When I was with you day after day in the temple [ enclosure] you did not stretch forth [your] hands against Me. But this is your hour--and the power [which] darkness [gives you has its way].
Luke,22,54,Then they seized Him and led Him away bringing Him into the house of the high priest. Peter was following at a distance.
Luke,22,55,And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together Peter sat among them.
Luke,22,56,Then a servant girl seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [intently] at him said This man too was with Him.
Luke,22,57,But he denied it and said Woman I do not know Him!
Luke,22,58,And a little later someone else saw him and said You are one of them also. But Peter said Man I am not!
Luke,22,59,And when about an hour more had elapsed still another emphatically insisted It is the truth that this man also was with Him for he too is a Galilean!
Luke,22,60,But Peter said Man I do not know what you are talking about. And instantly while he was still speaking the cock crowed.
Luke,22,61,And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter recalled the Lord's words how He had told him Before the cock crows today you will deny Me thrice.
Luke,22,62,And he went out and wept bitterly [that is with painfully moving grief].
Luke,22,63,Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him and beat Him;
Luke,22,64,They blindfolded Him also and asked Him Prophesy! Who is it that struck You?
Luke,22,65,And they said many other evil and slanderous and insulting words against Him reviling Him.
Luke,22,66,As soon as it was day the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together both chief priests and scribes; and they led Him into their council (the Sanhedrin) and they said
Luke,22,67,If You are the Christ (the Messiah) tell us. But He said to them If I tell you you will not believe (trust in cleave to and rely on what I say)
Luke,22,68,And if I question you you will not answer.
Luke,22,69,But hereafter (from this time on) the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
Luke,22,70,And they all said You are the Son of God then? And He said to them It is just as you say; I AM.
Luke,22,71,And they said What further evidence do we need? For we have heard [it] ourselves from His own mouth!
Luke,23,1,THEN THE whole assembly of them got up and conducted [Jesus] before Pilate.
Luke,23,2,And they began to accuse Him asserting We found this Man perverting (misleading corrupting and turning away) our nation and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar saying that He Himself is Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) a King!
Luke,23,3,So Pilate asked Him Are You the King of the Jews? And He answered him [ It is just as] you say. [I AM.]
Luke,23,4,And Pilate said to the chief priests and the throngs I find no guilt or crime in this Man.
Luke,23,5,But they were urgent and emphatic saying He stirs up and excites the people teaching throughout all Judea--from Galilee where He began even to this place.
Luke,23,6,Upon hearing this Pilate asked whether the Man was a Galilean.
Luke,23,7,And when he found out [certainly] that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he sent Him up to Herod [a higher authority] who was also in Jerusalem in those days.
Luke,23,8,Now when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad for he had eagerly desired to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard concerning Him and he was hoping to witness some sign (some striking evidence or spectacular performance) done by Him.
Luke,23,9,So he asked Him many questions but He made no reply.
Luke,23,10,Meanwhile the chief priests and the scribes stood by continuing vehemently and violently to accuse Him.
Luke,23,11,And Herod with his soldiers treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him; then dressing Him up in bright and gorgeous apparel he sent Him back to Pilate.
Luke,23,12,And that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other--[though] they had been at enmity before this.
Luke,23,13,Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
Luke,23,14,And said to them You brought this Man before me as One Who was perverting and misleading and turning away and corrupting the people; and behold after examining Him before you I have not found any offense (crime or guilt) in this Man in regard to your accusations against Him;
Luke,23,15,No nor indeed did Herod for he sent Him back to us; behold He has done nothing deserving of death.
Luke,23,16,I will therefore chastise Him and deliver Him amended (reformed taught His lesson) and release Him.
Luke,23,17,For it was necessary for him to release to them one prisoner at the Feast.
Luke,23,18,But they all together raised a deep cry [from the depths of their throats] saying Away with this Man! Release to us Barabbas!
Luke,23,19,He was a man who had been thrown into prison for raising a riot in the city and for murder.
Luke,23,20,Once more Pilate called to them wishing to release Jesus;
Luke,23,21,But they kept shouting out Crucify crucify Him!
Luke,23,22,A third time he said to them Why? What wrong has He done? I have found [no offense or crime or guilt] in Him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore chastise Him [ in order to teach Him better] and release Him.
Luke,23,23,But they were insistent and urgent demanding with loud cries that He should be crucified. And their voices prevailed (accomplished their purpose).
Luke,23,24,And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked should be done.
Luke,23,25,So he released the man who had been thrown into prison for riot and murder for whom they continued to ask but Jesus he delivered up to be done with as they willed.
Luke,23,26,And as they led Him away they seized one Simon of Cyrene who was coming in from the country and laid on him the cross and made him carry it behind Jesus.
Luke,23,27,And there accompanied [Jesus] a great multitude of the people [including] women who bewailed and lamented Him.
Luke,23,28,But Jesus turning toward them said Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for Me but weep for yourselves and for your children.
Luke,23,29,For behold the days are coming during which they will say Blessed (happy fortunate and to be envied) are the barren and the wombs that have not borne and the breasts that have never nursed [babies]!
Luke,23,30,Then they will begin to say to the mountains Fall on us! and to the hills Cover (conceal hide) us!
Luke,23,31,For if they do these things when the timber is green what will happen when it is dry?
Luke,23,32,Two others also who were criminals were led away to be executed with Him.
Luke,23,33,And when they came to the place which is called The Skull [Latin: Calvary; Hebrew: Golgotha] there they crucified Him and [along with] the criminals one on the right and one on the left.
Luke,23,34,And Jesus prayed Father forgive them for they know not what they do. And they divided His garments and distributed them by casting lots for them.
Luke,23,35,Now the people stood by [ calmly and leisurely] watching; but the rulers scoffed and sneered ( turned up their noses) at Him saying He rescued others [ from death]; let Him now rescue Himself if He is the Christ (the Messiah) of God His Chosen One!
Luke,23,36,The soldiers also ridiculed and made sport of Him coming up and offering Him vinegar (a sour wine mixed with water)
Luke,23,37,And saying If you are the King of the Jews save (rescue) Yourself [ from death].
Luke,23,38,For there was also an inscription above Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew: This is the King of the Jews.
Luke,23,39,One of the criminals who was suspended kept up a railing at Him saying Are You not the Christ (the Messiah)? Rescue Yourself and us [ from death]!
Luke,23,40,But the other one reproved him saying Do you not even fear God seeing you yourself are under the same sentence of condemnation and suffering the same penalty?
Luke,23,41,And we indeed suffer it justly receiving the due reward of our actions; but this Man has done nothing out of the way [nothing strange or eccentric or perverse or unreasonable].
Luke,23,42,Then he said to Jesus Lord remember me when You come in Your kingly glory!
Luke,23,43,And He answered him Truly I tell you today you shall be with Me in Paradise.
Luke,23,44,It was now about the sixth hour (midday) and darkness enveloped the whole land and earth until the ninth hour (about three o'clock in the afternoon)
Luke,23,45,While the sun's light faded or was darkened; and the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two.
Luke,23,46,And Jesus crying out with a loud voice said Father into Your hands I commit My spirit! And with these words He expired.
Luke,23,47,Now the centurion having seen what had taken place recognized God and thanked and praised Him and said Indeed without question this Man was upright (just and innocent)!
Luke,23,48,And all the throngs that had gathered to see this spectacle when they saw what had taken place returned to their homes beating their breasts.
Luke,23,49,And all the acquaintances of [Jesus] and the women who had followed Him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched these things.
Luke,23,50,Now notice there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council (the Sanhedrin) and a good (upright advantageous) man and righteous (in right standing with God and man)
Luke,23,51,Who had not agreed with or assented to the purpose and action of the others; and he was expecting and waiting for the kingdom of God.
Luke,23,52,This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke,23,53,Then he took it down and rolled it up in a linen cloth for swathing dead bodies and laid Him in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever yet been laid.
Luke,23,54,It was the day of Preparation [for the Sabbath] and the Sabbath was dawning (approaching).
Luke,23,55,The women who had come with [Jesus] from Galilee followed closely and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.
Luke,23,56,Then they went back and made ready spices and ointments (perfumes). On the Sabbath day they rested in accordance with the commandment.
Luke,24,1,BUT ON the first day of the week at early dawn [the women] went to the tomb taking the spices which they had made ready.
Luke,24,2,And they found the stone rolled back from the tomb
Luke,24,3,But when they went inside they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke,24,4,And while they were perplexed and wondering what to do about this behold two men in dazzling raiment suddenly stood beside them.
Luke,24,5,And as [the women] were frightened and were bowing their faces to the ground the men said to them Why do you look for the living among [those who are] dead?
Luke,24,6,He is not here but has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee
Luke,24,7,That the Son of Man must be given over into the hands of sinful men (men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God) and be crucified and on the third day rise [ from death].
Luke,24,8,And they remembered His words.
Luke,24,9,And having returned from the tomb they reported all these things [taken together] to the eleven apostles and to all the rest.
Luke,24,10,Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who reported these things to the apostles.
Luke,24,11,But these reports seemed to the men an idle tale ( madness feigned things nonsense) and they did not believe the women.
Luke,24,12,But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; and stooping down and looking in he saw the linen cloths alone by themselves and he went away wondering about and marveling at what had happened.
Luke,24,13,And behold that very day two of [the disciples] were going to a village called Emmaus [which is] about seven miles from Jerusalem.
Luke,24,14,And they were talking with each other about all these things that had occurred.
Luke,24,15,And while they were conversing and discussing together Jesus Himself caught up with them and was already accompanying them.
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were held so that they did not recognize Him.
Luke,24,17,And He said to them What is this discussion that you are exchanging ( throwing back and forth) between yourselves as you walk along? And they stood still looking sad and downcast.
Luke,24,18,Then one of them named Cleopas answered Him Do you alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things that have occurred there in these days?
Luke,24,19,And He said to them What [kind of ] things? And they said to Him About Jesus of Nazareth Who was a Prophet mighty in work and word before God and all the people--
Luke,24,20,And how our chief priests and rulers gave Him up to be sentenced to death and crucified Him.
Luke,24,21,But we were hoping that it was He Who would redeem and set Israel free. Yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things occurred.
Luke,24,22,And moreover some women of our company astounded us and drove us out of our senses. They were at the tomb early [in the morning]
Luke,24,23,But did not find His body; and they returned saying that they had [even] seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive!
Luke,24,24,So some of those [who were] with us went to the tomb and they found it just as the women had said but Him they did not see.
Luke,24,25,And [Jesus] said to them O foolish ones [sluggish in mind dull of perception] and slow of heart to believe (adhere to and trust in and rely on) everything that the prophets have spoken!
Luke,24,26,Was it not necessary and essentially fitting that the Christ (the Messiah) should suffer all these things before entering into His glory (His majesty and splendor)?
Luke,24,27,Then beginning with Moses and [throughout] all the Prophets He went on explaining and interpreting to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning and referring to Himself.
Luke,24,28,Then they drew near the village to which they were going and He acted as if He would go further.
Luke,24,29,But they urged and insisted saying to Him Remain with us for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent. So He went in to stay with them.
Luke,24,30,And it occurred that as He reclined at table with them He took [a loaf of] bread and praised [God] and gave thanks and asked a blessing and then broke it and was giving it to them
Luke,24,31,When their eyes were [instantly] opened and they [clearly] recognized Him and He vanished ( departed invisibly).
Luke,24,32,And they said to one another Were not our hearts greatly moved and burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and as He opened and explained to us [the sense of] the Scriptures?
Luke,24,33,And rising up that very hour they went back to Jerusalem where they found the Eleven [apostles] gathered together and those who were with them
Luke,24,34,Who said The Lord really has risen and has appeared to Simon (Peter)!
Luke,24,35,Then they [themselves] related [in full] what had happened on the road and how He was known and recognized by them in the breaking of bread.
Luke,24,36,Now while they were talking about this Jesus Himself took His stand among them and said to them Peace ( freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin) be to you!
Luke,24,37,But they were so startled and terrified that they thought they saw a spirit.
Luke,24,38,And He said to them Why are you disturbed and troubled and why do such doubts and questionings arise in your hearts?
Luke,24,39,See My hands and My feet that it is I Myself! Feel and handle Me and see for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.
Luke,24,40,And when He had said this He showed them His hands and His feet.
Luke,24,41,And while [since] they still could not believe it for sheer joy and marveled He said to them Have you anything here to eat?
Luke,24,42,They gave Him a piece of broiled fish
Luke,24,43,And He took [it] and ate [it] before them.
Luke,24,44,Then He said to them This is what I told you while I was still with you: everything which is written concerning Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.
Luke,24,45,Then He [thoroughly] opened up their minds to understand the Scriptures
Luke,24,46,And said to them Thus it is written that the Christ (the Messiah) should suffer and on the third day rise from ( among) the dead
Luke,24,47,And that repentance [with a view to and as the condition of] forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations beginning from Jerusalem.
Luke,24,48,You are witnesses of these things.
Luke,24,49,And behold I will send forth upon you what My Father has promised; but remain in the city [Jerusalem] until you are clothed with power from on high.
Luke,24,50,Then He conducted them out as far as Bethany and lifting up His hands He invoked a blessing on them.
Luke,24,51,And it occurred that while He was blessing them He parted from them and was taken up into heaven.
Luke,24,52,And they worshiping Him went back to Jerusalem with great joy;
Luke,24,53,And they were continually in the temple celebrating with praises and blessing and extolling God. Amen (so be it).
John,1,1,IN THE beginning [before all time] was the Word ( Christ) and the Word was with God and the Word was God Himself.
John,1,2,He was present originally with God.
John,1,3,All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being.
John,1,4,In Him was Life and the Life was the Light of men.
John,1,5,And the Light shines on in the darkness for the darkness has never overpowered it [put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it and is unreceptive to it].
John,1,6,There came a man sent from God whose name was John.
John,1,7,This man came to witness that he might testify of the Light that all men might believe in it [adhere to it trust it and rely upon it] through him.
John,1,8,He was not the Light himself but came that he might bear witness regarding the Light.
John,1,9,There it was--the true Light [was then] coming into the world [the genuine perfect steadfast Light] that illumines every person.
John,1,10,He came into the world and though the world was made through Him the world did not recognize Him [did not know Him].
John,1,11,He came to that which belonged to Him [to His own--His domain creation things world] and they who were His own did not receive Him and did not welcome Him.
John,1,12,But to as many as did receive and welcome Him He gave the authority (power privilege right) to become the children of God that is to those who believe in (adhere to trust in and rely on) His name--
John,1,13,Who owe their birth neither to bloods nor to the will of the flesh [that of physical impulse] nor to the will of man [that of a natural father] but to God. [They are born of God!]
John,1,14,And the Word (Christ) became flesh (human incarnate) and tabernacled (fixed His tent of flesh lived awhile) among us; and we [actually] saw His glory (His honor His majesty) such glory as an only begotten son receives from his father full of grace (favor loving-kindness) and truth.
John,1,15,John testified about Him and cried out This was He of Whom I said He Who comes after me has priority over me for He was before me. [He takes rank above me for He existed before I did. He has advanced before me because He is my Chief.]
John,1,16,For out of His fullness (abundance) we have all received [all had a share and we were all supplied with] one grace after another and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favor upon favor and gift [heaped] upon gift.
John,1,17,For while the Law was given through Moses grace ( unearned undeserved favor and spiritual blessing) and truth came through Jesus Christ.
John,1,18,No man has ever seen God at any time; the only unique Son or the only begotten God Who is in the bosom [in the intimate presence] of the Father He has declared Him [He has revealed Him and brought Him out where He can be seen; He has interpreted Him and He has made Him known].
John,1,19,And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him Who are you?
John,1,20,He confessed (admitted the truth) and did not try to conceal it but acknowledged I am not the Christ!
John,1,21,They asked him What then? Are you Elijah? And he said I am not! Are you the Prophet? And he answered No!
John,1,22,Then they said to him Who are you? Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?
John,1,23,He said I am the voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness [the voice of one shouting in the desert] Prepare the way of the Lord [level straighten out the path of the Lord] as the prophet Isaiah said.
John,1,24,The messengers had been sent from the Pharisees.
John,1,25,And they asked him Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?
John,1,26,John answered them I [only] baptize in (with) water. Among you there stands One Whom you do not recognize and with Whom you are not acquainted and of Whom you know nothing.
John,1,27,It is He Who coming after me is preferred before me the string of Whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.
John,1,28,These things occurred in Bethany (Bethabara) across the Jordan [ at the Jordan crossing] where John was then baptizing.
John,1,29,The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said Look! There is the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!
John,1,30,This is He of Whom I said After me comes a Man Who has priority over me [Who takes rank above me] because He was before me and existed before I did.
John,1,31,And I did not know Him and did not recognize Him [myself]; but it is in order that He should be made manifest and be revealed to Israel [be brought out where we can see Him] that I came baptizing in (with) water.
John,1,32,John gave further evidence saying I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven and it dwelt on Him [never to depart].
John,1,33,And I did not know Him nor recognize Him but He Who sent me to baptize in (with) water said to me Upon Him Whom you shall see the Spirit descend and remain that One is He Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
John,1,34,And I have seen [that happen--I actually did see it] and my testimony is that this is the Son of God!
John,1,35,Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples
John,1,36,And he looked at Jesus as He walked along and said Look! There is the Lamb of God!
John,1,37,The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Him.
John,1,38,But Jesus turned and as He saw them following Him He said to them What are you looking for? [And what is it you wish?] And they answered Him Rabbi--which translated is Teacher--where are You staying?
John,1,39,He said to them Come and see. So they went and saw where He was staying and they remained with Him that day. It was then about the tenth hour (about four o'clock in the afternoon).
John,1,40,One of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus was Andrew Simon Peter's brother.
John,1,41,He first sought out and found his own brother Simon and said to him We have found (discovered) the Messiah!--which translated is the Christ (the Anointed One).
John,1,42,Andrew then led (brought) Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas--which translated is Peter [Stone].
John,1,43,The next day Jesus desired and decided to go into Galilee; and He found Philip and said to him Join Me as My attendant and follow Me.
John,1,44,Now Philip was from Bethsaida of the same city as Andrew and Peter.
John,1,45,Philip sought and found Nathanael and told him We have found (discovered) the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about--Jesus from Nazareth the [legal] son of Joseph!
John,1,46,Nathanael answered him [Nazareth!] Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied Come and see!
John,1,47,Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him See! Here is an Israelite indeed [a true descendant of Jacob] in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor falsehood nor duplicity!
John,1,48,Nathanael said to Jesus How do You know me? [How is it that You know these things about me?] Jesus answered him Before [ever] Philip called you when you were still under the fig tree I saw you.
John,1,49,Nathanael answered Teacher You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!
John,1,50,Jesus replied Because I said to you I saw you beneath the fig tree do you believe in and rely on and trust in Me? You shall see greater things than this!
John,1,51,Then He said to him I assure you most solemnly I tell you all you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man!
John,2,1,ON THE third day there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there.
John,2,2,Jesus also was invited with His disciples to the wedding.
John,2,3,And when the wine was all gone the mother of Jesus said to Him They have no more wine!
John,2,4,Jesus said to her [ Dear] woman what is that to you and to Me? [What do we have in common? Leave it to Me.] My time (hour to act) has not yet come.
John,2,5,His mother said to the servants Whatever He says to you do it.
John,2,6,Now there were six waterpots of stone standing there as the Jewish custom of purification (ceremonial washing) demanded holding twenty to thirty gallons apiece.
John,2,7,Jesus said to them Fill the waterpots with water. So they filled them up to the brim.
John,2,8,Then He said to them Draw some out now and take it to the manager of the feast [to the one presiding the superintendent of the banquet]. So they took him some.
John,2,9,And when the manager tasted the water just now turned into wine not knowing where it came from--though the servants who had drawn the water knew--he called the bridegroom
John,2,10,And said to him Everyone else serves his best wine first and when people have drunk freely then he serves that which is not so good; but you have kept back the good wine until now!
John,2,11,This the first of His signs (miracles wonderworks) Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory [by it He displayed His greatness and His power openly] and His disciples believed in Him [adhered to trusted in and relied on Him].
John,2,12,After that He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and disciples and they stayed there only a few days.
John,2,13,Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John,2,14,There He found in the temple [ enclosure] those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves and the money changers sitting there [also at their stands].
John,2,15,And having made a lash (a whip) of cords He drove them all out of the temple [ enclosure]--both the sheep and the oxen--spilling and scattering the brokers' money and upsetting and tossing around their trays (their stands).
John,2,16,Then to those who sold the doves He said Take these things away (out of here)! Make not My Father's house a house of merchandise (a marketplace a sales shop)!
John,2,17,And His disciples remembered that it is written [in the Holy Scriptures] Zeal (the fervor of love) for Your house will eat Me up. [I will be consumed with jealousy for the honor of Your house.]
John,2,18,Then the Jews retorted What sign can You show us seeing You do these things? [What sign miracle token indication can You give us as evidence that You have authority and are commissioned to act in this way?]
John,2,19,Jesus answered them Destroy (undo) this temple and in three days I will raise it up again.
John,2,20,Then the Jews replied It took forty-six years to build this temple (sanctuary) and will You raise it up in three days?
John,2,21,But He had spoken of the temple which was His body.
John,2,22,When therefore He had risen from the dead His disciples remembered that He said this. And so they believed and trusted and relied on the Scripture and the word (message) Jesus had spoken.
John,2,23,But when He was in Jerusalem during the Passover Feast many believed in His name [identified themselves with His party] after seeing His signs (wonders miracles) which He was doing.
John,2,24,But Jesus [for His part] did not trust Himself to them because He knew all [men];
John,2,25,And He did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man [needed no evidence from anyone about men] for He Himself knew what was in human nature. [He could read men's hearts.] [I Sam. 16:7.]
John,3,1,NOW THERE was a certain man among the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler (a leader an authority) among the Jews
John,3,2,Who came to Jesus at night and said to Him Rabbi we know and are certain that You have come from God [as] a Teacher; for no one can do these signs (these wonderworks these miracles--and produce the proofs) that You do unless God is with him.
John,3,3,Jesus answered him I assure you most solemnly I tell you that unless a person is born again (anew from above) he cannot ever see (know be acquainted with and experience) the kingdom of God.
John,3,4,Nicodemus said to Him How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb again and be born?
John,3,5,Jesus answered I assure you most solemnly I tell you unless a man is born of water and [ even] the Spirit he cannot [ever] enter the kingdom of God.
John,3,6,What is born of [from] the flesh is flesh [of the physical is physical]; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John,3,7,Marvel not [do not be surprised astonished] at My telling you You must all be born anew (from above).
John,3,8,The wind blows (breathes) where it wills; and though you hear its sound yet you neither know where it comes from nor where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
John,3,9,Nicodemus answered by asking How can all this be possible?
John,3,10,Jesus replied Are you the teacher of Israel and yet do not know nor understand these things? [Are they strange to you?]
John,3,11,I assure you most solemnly I tell you We speak only of what we know [we know absolutely what we are talking about]; we have actually seen what we are testifying to [we were eyewitnesses of it]. And still you do not receive our testimony [you reject and refuse our evidence--that of Myself and of all those who are born of the Spirit].
John,3,12,If I have told you of things that happen right here on the earth and yet none of you believes Me how can you believe (trust Me adhere to Me rely on Me) if I tell you of heavenly things?
John,3,13,And yet no one has ever gone up to heaven but there is One Who has come down from heaven--the Son of Man [Himself] Who is (dwells has His home) in heaven.
John,3,14,And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert [on a pole] so must [so it is necessary that] the Son of Man be lifted up [on the cross]
John,3,15,In order that everyone who believes in Him [who cleaves to Him trusts Him and relies on Him] may not perish but have eternal life and [actually] live forever!
John,3,16,For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten ( unique) Son so that whoever believes in (trusts in clings to relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life.
John,3,17,For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge (to reject to condemn to pass sentence on) the world but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him.
John,3,18,He who believes in Him [who clings to trusts in relies on Him] is not judged [he who trusts in Him never comes up for judgment; for him there is no rejection no condemnation--he incurs no damnation]; but he who does not believe (cleave to rely on trust in Him) is judged already [he has already been convicted and has already received his sentence] because he has not believed in and trusted in the name of the only begotten Son of God. [He is condemned for refusing to let his trust rest in Christ's name.]
John,3,19,The [basis of the] judgment (indictment the test by which men are judged the ground for the sentence) lies in this: the Light has come into the world and people have loved the darkness rather than and more than the Light for their works (deeds) were evil.
John,3,20,For every wrongdoer hates (loathes detests) the Light and will not come out into the Light but shrinks from it lest his works (his deeds his activities his conduct) be exposed and reproved.
John,3,21,But he who practices truth [who does what is right] comes out into the Light; so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are--wrought with God [divinely prompted done with God's help in dependence upon Him].
John,3,22,After this Jesus and His disciples went into the land (the countryside) of Judea where He remained with them and baptized.
John,3,23,But John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim for there was an abundance of water there and the people kept coming and being baptized.
John,3,24,For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
John,3,25,Therefore there arose a controversy between some of John's disciples and a Jew in regard to purification.
John,3,26,So they came to John and reported to him Rabbi the Man Who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [ at the Jordan crossing]--and to Whom you yourself have borne testimony--notice here He is baptizing too and everybody is flocking to Him!
John,3,27,John answered A man can receive nothing [he can claim nothing he can take unto himself nothing] except as it has been granted to him from heaven. [A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from heaven; there is no other source.]
John,3,28,You yourselves are my witnesses [you personally bear me out] that I stated I am not the Christ (the Anointed One the Messiah) but I have [only] been sent before Him [in advance of Him to be His appointed forerunner His messenger His announcer].
John,3,29,He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the groomsman who stands by and listens to him rejoices greatly and heartily on account of the bridegroom's voice. This then is my pleasure and joy and it is now complete. [S. of Sol. 5:1.]
John,3,30,He must increase but I must decrease. [He must grow more prominent; I must grow less so.]
John,3,31,He Who comes from above (heaven) is [far] above all [others]; he who comes from the earth belongs to the earth and talks the language of earth [his words are from an earthly standpoint]. He Who comes from heaven is [far] above all others [far superior to all others in prominence and in excellence].
John,3,32,It is to what He has [actually] seen and heard that He bears testimony and yet no one accepts His testimony [no one receives His evidence as true].
John,3,33,Whoever receives His testimony has set his seal of approval to this: God is true. [That man has definitely certified acknowledged declared once and for all and is himself assured that it is divine truth that God cannot lie].
John,3,34,For since He Whom God has sent speaks the words of God [proclaims God's own message] God does not give Him His Spirit sparingly or by measure but boundless is the gift God makes of His Spirit!
John,3,35,The Father loves the Son and has given (entrusted committed) everything into His hand.
John,3,36,And he who believes in (has faith in clings to relies on) the Son has (now possesses) eternal life. But whoever disobeys (is unbelieving toward refuses to trust in disregards is not subject to) the Son will never see (experience) life but [instead] the wrath of God abides on him. [God's displeasure remains on him; His indignation hangs over him continually.]
John,4,1,NOW WHEN the Lord knew (learned became aware) that the Pharisees had been told that Jesus was winning and baptizing more disciples than John--
John,4,2,Though Jesus Himself did not baptize but His disciples--
John,4,3,He left Judea and returned to Galilee.
John,4,4,It was necessary for Him to go through Samaria.
John,4,5,And in doing so He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
John,4,6,And Jacob's well was there. So Jesus tired as He was from His journey sat down [to rest] by the well. It was then about the sixth hour (about noon).
John,4,7,Presently when a woman of Samaria came along to draw water Jesus said to her Give Me a drink--
John,4,8,For His disciples had gone off into the town to buy food--
John,4,9,The Samaritan woman said to Him How is it that You being a Jew ask me a Samaritan [and a] woman for a drink?--For the Jews have nothing to do with the Samaritans--
John,4,10,Jesus answered her If you had only known and had recognized God's gift and Who this is that is saying to you Give Me a drink you would have asked Him [instead] and He would have given you living water.
John,4,11,She said to Him Sir You have nothing to draw with [no drawing bucket] and the well is deep; how then can You provide living water? [Where do You get Your living water?]
John,4,12,Are You greater than and superior to our ancestor Jacob who gave us this well and who used to drink from it himself and his sons and his cattle also?
John,4,13,Jesus answered her All who drink of this water will be thirsty again.
John,4,14,But whoever takes a drink of the water that I will give him shall never no never be thirsty any more. But the water that I will give him shall become a spring of water welling up (flowing bubbling) [continually] within him unto (into for) eternal life.
John,4,15,The woman said to Him Sir give me this water so that I may never get thirsty nor have to come [continually all the way] here to draw.
John,4,16,At this Jesus said to her Go call your husband and come back here.
John,4,17,The woman answered I have no husband. Jesus said to her You have spoken truly in saying I have no husband.
John,4,18,For you have had five husbands and the man you are now living with is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.
John,4,19,The woman said to Him Sir I see and understand that You are a prophet.
John,4,20,Our forefathers worshiped on this mountain but you [Jews] say that Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary and proper to worship.
John,4,21,Jesus said to her Woman believe Me a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither [merely] in this mountain nor [merely] in Jerusalem.
John,4,22,You [Samaritans] do not know what you are worshiping [you worship what you do not comprehend]. We do know what we are worshiping [we worship what we have knowledge of and understand] for [after all] salvation comes from [among] the Jews.
John,4,23,A time will come however indeed it is already here when the true (genuine) worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth (reality); for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers.
John,4,24,God is a Spirit (a spiritual Being) and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth (reality).
John,4,25,The woman said to Him I know that Messiah is coming He Who is called the Christ (the Anointed One); and when He arrives He will tell us everything we need to know and make it clear to us.
John,4,26,Jesus said to her I Who now speak with you am He.
John,4,27,Just then His disciples came and they wondered (were surprised astonished) to find Him talking with a woman [a married woman]. However not one of them asked Him What are You inquiring about? or What do You want? or Why do You speak with her?
John,4,28,Then the woman left her water jar and went away to the town. And she began telling the people
John,4,29,Come see a Man Who has told me everything that I ever did! Can this be [is not this] the Christ? [Must not this be the Messiah the Anointed One?]
John,4,30,So the people left the town and set out to go to Him.
John,4,31,Meanwhile the disciples urged Him saying Rabbi eat something.
John,4,32,But He assured them I have food (nourishment) to eat of which you know nothing and have no idea.
John,4,33,So the disciples said one to another Has someone brought Him something to eat?
John,4,34,Jesus said to them My food (nourishment) is to do the will (pleasure) of Him Who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work.
John,4,35,Do you not say It is still four months until harvest time comes? Look! I tell you raise your eyes and observe the fields and see how they are already white for harvesting.
John,4,36,Already the reaper is getting his wages [he who does the cutting now has his reward] for he is gathering fruit (crop) unto life eternal so that he who does the planting and he who does the reaping may rejoice together.
John,4,37,For in this the saying holds true One sows and another reaps.
John,4,38,I sent you to reap a crop for which you have not toiled. Other men have labored and you have stepped in to reap the results of their work.
John,4,39,Now numerous Samaritans from that town believed in and trusted in Him because of what the woman said when she declared and testified He told me everything that I ever did.
John,4,40,So when the Samaritans arrived they asked Him to remain with them and He did stay there two days.
John,4,41,Then many more believed in and adhered to and relied on Him because of His personal message [what He Himself said].
John,4,42,And they told the woman Now we no longer believe (trust have faith) just because of what you said; for we have heard Him ourselves [personally] and we know that He truly is the Savior of the world the Christ.
John,4,43,But after these two days Jesus went on from there into Galilee--
John,4,44,Although He Himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
John,4,45,However when He came into Galilee the Galileans also welcomed Him and took Him to their hearts eagerly for they had seen everything that He did in Jerusalem during the Feast; for they too had attended the Feast.
John,4,46,So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was lying ill in Capernaum.
John,4,47,Having heard that Jesus had come back from Judea into Galilee he went away to meet Him and began to beg Him to come down and cure his son for he was lying at the point of death.
John,4,48,Then Jesus said to him Unless you see signs and miracles happen you [people] never will believe (trust have faith) at all.
John,4,49,The king's officer pleaded with Him Sir do come down at once before my little child is dead!
John,4,50,Jesus answered him Go in peace; your son will live! And the man put his trust in what Jesus said and started home.
John,4,51,But even as he was on the road going down his servants met him and reported saying Your son lives!
John,4,52,So he asked them at what time he had begun to get better. They said Yesterday during the seventh hour (about one o'clock in the afternoon) the fever left him.
John,4,53,Then the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him Your son will live. And he and his entire household believed (adhered to trusted in and relied on Jesus).
John,4,54,This is the second sign (wonderwork miracle) that Jesus performed after He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
John,5,1,LATER ON there was a Jewish festival (feast) for which Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John,5,2,Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep Gate. This pool in the Hebrew is called Bethesda having five porches (alcoves colonnades doorways).
John,5,3,In these lay a great number of sick folk--some blind some crippled and some paralyzed (shriveled up)--waiting for the bubbling up of the water.
John,5,4,For an angel of the Lord went down at appointed seasons into the pool and moved and stirred up the water; whoever then first after the stirring up of the water stepped in was cured of whatever disease with which he was afflicted.
John,5,5,There was a certain man there who had suffered with a deep-seated and lingering disorder for thirty-eight years.
John,5,6,When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless] knowing that he had already been a long time in that condition He said to him Do you want to become well? [Are you really in earnest about getting well?]
John,5,7,The invalid answered Sir I have nobody when the water is moving to put me into the pool; but while I am trying to come [into it] myself somebody else steps down ahead of me.
John,5,8,Jesus said to him Get up! Pick up your bed (sleeping pad) and walk!
John,5,9,Instantly the man became well and recovered his strength and picked up his bed and walked. But that happened on the Sabbath.
John,5,10,So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed It is the Sabbath and you have no right to pick up your bed [it is not lawful].
John,5,11,He answered them The Man Who healed me and gave me back my strength He Himself said to me Pick up your bed and walk!
John,5,12,They asked him Who is the Man Who told you Pick up your bed and walk?
John,5,13,Now the invalid who had been healed did not know who it was for Jesus had quietly gone away [had passed on unnoticed] since there was a crowd in the place.
John,5,14,Afterward when Jesus found him in the temple He said to him See you are well! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.
John,5,15,The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus Who had made him well.
John,5,16,For this reason the Jews began to persecute (annoy torment) Jesus and sought to kill Him because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
John,5,17,But Jesus answered them My Father has worked [even] until now [He has never ceased working; He is still working] and I too must be at [divine] work.
John,5,18,This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him [to do away with Him]; because He not only was breaking (weakening violating) the Sabbath but He actually was speaking of God as being [in a special sense] His own Father making Himself equal [putting Himself on a level] with God.
John,5,19,So Jesus answered them by saying I assure you most solemnly I tell you the Son is able to do nothing of Himself (of His own accord); but He is able to do only what He sees the Father doing for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the same way [in His turn].
John,5,20,The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to (shows) Him everything that He Himself does. And He will disclose to Him (let Him see) greater things yet than these so that you may marvel and be full of wonder and astonishment.
John,5,21,Just as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life [makes them live on] even so the Son also gives life to whomever He wills and is pleased to give it.
John,5,22,Even the Father judges no one for He has given all judgment (the last judgment and the whole business of judging) entirely into the hands of the Son
John,5,23,So that all men may give honor (reverence homage) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father. [In fact] whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father Who has sent Him.
John,5,24,I assure you most solemnly I tell you the person whose ears are open to My words [who listens to My message] and believes and trusts in and clings to and relies on Him Who sent Me has (possesses now) eternal life. And he does not come into judgment [does not incur sentence of judgment will not come under condemnation] but he has already passed over out of death into life.
John,5,25,Believe Me when I assure you most solemnly I tell you the time is coming and is here now when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear it shall live.
John,5,26,For even as the Father has life in Himself and is self-existent so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself and be self-existent.
John,5,27,And He has given Him authority and granted Him power to execute (exercise practice) judgment because He is a Son of man [very man].
John,5,28,Do not be surprised and wonder at this for the time is coming when all those who are in the tombs shall hear His voice
John,5,29,And they shall come out--those who have practiced doing good [will come out] to the resurrection of [new] life and those who have done evil will be raised for judgment [raised to meet their sentence].
John,5,30,I am able to do nothing from Myself [independently of My own accord--but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders]. Even as I hear I judge [I decide as I am bidden to decide. As the voice comes to Me so I give a decision] and My judgment is right (just righteous) because I do not seek or consult My own will [I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself My own aim My own purpose] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me.
John,5,31,If I alone testify in My behalf My testimony is not valid and cannot be worth anything.
John,5,32,There is Another Who testifies concerning Me and I know and am certain that His evidence on My behalf is true and valid.
John,5,33,You yourselves have sent [an inquiry] to John and he has been a witness to the truth.
John,5,34,But I do not receive [a mere] human witness [the evidence which I accept on My behalf is not from man]; but I simply mention all these things in order that you may be saved (made and kept safe and sound).
John,5,35,John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [to show you the way] and you were willing for a while to delight (sun) yourselves in his light.
John,5,36,But I have as My witness something greater (weightier higher better) than that of John; for the works that the Father has appointed Me to accomplish and finish the very same works that I am now doing are a witness and proof that the Father has sent Me.
John,5,37,And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me. Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form (His face--what He is like). [You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him.]
John,5,38,And you have not His word (His thought) living in your hearts because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent. [That is why you do not keep His message living in you because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent.]
John,5,39,You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them. And these [very Scriptures] testify about Me!
John,5,40,And still you are not willing [but refuse] to come to Me so that you might have life.
John,5,41,I receive not glory from men [I crave no human honor I look for no mortal fame]
John,5,42,But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you.
John,5,43,I have come in My Father's name and with His power and you do not receive Me [your hearts are not open to Me you give Me no welcome]; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself you will receive him and give him your approval.
John,5,44,How is it possible for you to believe [how can you learn to believe] you who [are content to seek and] receive praise and honor and glory from one another and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God?
John,5,45,Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [as some of you are supposing] that I will accuse you before the Father. There is one who accuses you--it is Moses the very one on whom you have built your hopes [in whom you trust].
John,5,46,For if you believed and relied on Moses you would believe and rely on Me for he wrote about Me [personally].
John,5,47,But if you do not believe and trust his writings how then will you believe and trust My teachings? [How shall you cleave to and rely on My words?]
John,6,1,AFTER THIS Jesus went to the farther side of the Sea of Galilee--that is the Sea of Tiberias.
John,6,2,And a great crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs (miracles) which He [continually] performed upon those who were sick.
John,6,3,And Jesus walked up the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples.
John,6,4,Now the Passover the feast of the Jews was approaching.
John,6,5,Jesus looked up then and seeing that a vast multitude was coming toward Him He said to Philip Where are we to buy bread so that all these people may eat?
John,6,6,But He said this to prove (test) him for He well knew what He was about to do.
John,6,7,Philip answered Him Two hundred pennies' (forty dollars) worth of bread is not enough that everyone may receive even a little.
John,6,8,Another of His disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother said to Him
John,6,9,There is a little boy here who has [with him] five barley loaves and two small fish; but what are they among so many people?
John,6,10,Jesus said Make all the people recline (sit down). Now the ground (a pasture) was covered with thick grass at the spot so the men threw themselves down about 5000 in number.
John,6,11,Jesus took the loaves and when He had given thanks He distributed to the disciples and the disciples to the reclining people; so also [He did] with the fish as much as they wanted.
John,6,12,When they had all had enough He said to His disciples Gather up now the fragments (the broken pieces that are left over) so that nothing may be lost and wasted.
John,6,13,So accordingly they gathered them up and they filled twelve [ small hand] baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves.
John,6,14,When the people saw the sign (miracle) that Jesus had performed they began saying Surely and beyond a doubt this is the Prophet Who is to come into the world!
John,6,15,Then Jesus knowing that they meant to come and seize Him that they might make Him king withdrew again to the hillside by Himself alone.
John,6,16,When evening came His disciples went down to the sea
John,6,17,And they took a boat and were going across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark and still Jesus had not [yet] come back to them.
John,6,18,Meanwhile the sea was getting rough and rising high because of a great and violent wind that was blowing.
John,6,19,[However] when they had rowed three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat. And they were afraid (terrified).
John,6,20,But Jesus said to them It is I; be not afraid! [I AM; stop being frightened!]
John,6,21,Then they were quite willing and glad for Him to come into the boat. And now the boat went at once to the land they had steered toward. [And immediately they reached the shore toward which they had been slowly making their way.]
John,6,22,The next day the crowd [that still remained] standing on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there and that Jesus had not gone into it with His disciples but that His disciples had gone away by themselves.
John,6,23,But now some other boats from Tiberias had come in near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John,6,24,So the people finding that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.
John,6,25,And when they found Him on the other side of the lake they said to Him Rabbi! When did You come here?
John,6,26,Jesus answered them I assure you most solemnly I tell you you have been searching for Me not because you saw the miracles and signs but because you were fed with the loaves and were filled and satisfied.
John,6,27,Stop toiling and doing and producing for the food that perishes and decomposes [in the using] but strive and work and produce rather for the [lasting] food which endures [continually] unto life eternal; the Son of Man will give (furnish) you that for God the Father has authorized and certified Him and put His seal of endorsement upon Him.
John,6,28,They then said What are we to do that we may [habitually] be working the works of God? [What are we to do to carry out what God requires?]
John,6,29,Jesus replied This is the work (service) that God asks of you: that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [that you cleave to trust rely on and have faith in His Messenger].
John,6,30,Therefore they said to Him What sign (miracle wonderwork) will You perform then so that we may see it and believe and rely on and adhere to You? What [supernatural] work have You [to show what You can do]?
John,6,31,Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as the Scripture says He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.
John,6,32,Jesus then said to them I assure you most solemnly I tell you Moses did not give you the Bread from heaven [what Moses gave you was not the Bread from heaven] but it is My Father Who gives you the true heavenly Bread.
John,6,33,For the Bread of God is He Who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.
John,6,34,Then they said to Him Lord give us this bread always (all the time)!
John,6,35,Jesus replied I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me will never be hungry and he who believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me will never thirst any more (at any time).
John,6,36,But [as] I told you although you have seen Me still you do not believe and trust and have faith.
John,6,37,All whom My Father gives (entrusts) to Me will come to Me; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [I will never no never reject one of them who comes to Me].
John,6,38,For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will and purpose but to do the will and purpose of Him Who sent Me.
John,6,39,And this is the will of Him Who sent Me that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me but that I should give new life and raise [them all] up at the last day.
John,6,40,For this is My Father's will and His purpose that everyone who sees the Son and believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Him should have eternal life and I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day.
John,6,41,Now the Jews murmured and found fault with and grumbled about Jesus because He said I am [Myself] the Bread that came down from heaven.
John,6,42,They kept asking Is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph Whose father and mother we know? How then can He say I have come down from heaven?
John,6,43,So Jesus answered them Stop grumbling and saying things against Me to one another.
John,6,44,No one is able to come to Me unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him and gives him the desire to come to Me and [then] I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day.
John,6,45,It is written in [the book of] the Prophets And they shall all be taught of God [have Him in person for their Teacher]. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me--
John,6,46,Which does not imply that anyone has seen the Father [not that anyone has ever seen Him] except He [Who was with the Father] Who comes from God; He [alone] has seen the Father.
John,6,47,I assure you most solemnly I tell you he who believes in Me [who adheres to trusts in relies on and has faith in Me] has (now possesses) eternal life.
John,6,48,I am the Bread of Life [that gives life--the Living Bread].
John,6,49,Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and [yet] they died.
John,6,50,[But] this is the Bread that comes down from heaven so that [any]one may eat of it and never die.
John,6,51,I [Myself] am this Living Bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread he will live forever; and also the Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh (body).
John,6,52,Then the Jews angrily contended with one another saying How is He able to give us His flesh to eat?
John,6,53,And Jesus said to them I assure you most solemnly I tell you you cannot have any life in you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [unless you appropriate His life and the saving merit of His blood].
John,6,54,He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has (possesses now) eternal life and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day.
John,6,55,For My flesh is true and genuine food and My blood is true and genuine drink.
John,6,56,He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood dwells continually in Me and I [in like manner dwell continually] in him.
John,6,57,Just as the living Father sent Me and I live by (through because of) the Father even so whoever continues to feed on Me [whoever takes Me for his food and is nourished by Me] shall [in his turn] live through and because of Me.
John,6,58,This is the Bread that came down from heaven. It is not like the manna which our forefathers ate and yet died; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live forever.
John,6,59,He said these things in a synagogue while He was teaching at Capernaum.
John,6,60,When His disciples heard this many of them said This is a hard and difficult and strange saying (an offensive and unbearable message). Who can stand to hear it? [Who can be expected to listen to such teaching?]
John,6,61,But Jesus knowing within Himself that His disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it said to them: Is this a stumbling block and an offense to you? [Does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you?]
John,6,62,What then [will be your reaction] if you should see the Son of Man ascending to [the place] where He was before?
John,6,63,It is the Spirit Who gives life [He is the Life-giver]; the flesh conveys no benefit whatever [there is no profit in it]. The words (truths) that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life.
John,6,64,But [still] some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith. For Jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray Him and be false to Him.
John,6,65,And He said This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted him [unless he is enabled to do so] by the Father.
John,6,66,After this many of His disciples drew back (returned to their old associations) and no longer accompanied Him.
John,6,67,Jesus said to the Twelve Will you also go away? [And do you too desire to leave Me?]
John,6,68,Simon Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go? You have the words (the message) of eternal life.
John,6,69,And we have learned to believe and trust and [more] we have come to know [surely] that You are the Holy One of God the Christ (the Anointed One) the Son of the living God.
John,6,70,Jesus answered them Did I not choose you the Twelve? And [yet] one of you is a devil (of the evil one and a false accuser).
John,6,71,He was speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot for he was about to betray Him [although] he was one of the Twelve.
John,7,1,AFTER THIS Jesus went from place to place in Galilee for He would not travel in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
John,7,2,Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was drawing near.
John,7,3,So His brothers said to Him Leave here and go into Judea so that Your disciples [there] may also see the works that You do. [This is no place for You.]
John,7,4,For no one does anything in secret when he wishes to be conspicuous and secure publicity. If You [must] do these things [if You must act like this] show Yourself openly and make Yourself known to the world!
John,7,5,For [even] His brothers did not believe in or adhere to or trust in or rely on Him either.
John,7,6,Whereupon Jesus said to them My time (opportunity) has not come yet; but any time is suitable for you and your opportunity is ready any time [is always here].
John,7,7,The world cannot [be expected to] hate you but it does hate Me because I denounce it for its wicked works and reveal that its doings are evil.
John,7,8,Go to the Feast yourselves. I am not [yet] going up to the Festival because My time is not ripe. [My term is not yet completed; it is not time for Me to go.]
John,7,9,Having said these things to them He stayed behind in Galilee.
John,7,10,But afterward when His brothers had gone up to the Feast He went up also not publicly [not with a caravan] but by Himself quietly and as if He did not wish to be observed.
John,7,11,Therefore the Jews kept looking for Him at the Feast and asking Where can He be? [Where is that Fellow?]
John,7,12,And there was among the mass of the people much whispered discussion and hot disputing about Him. Some were saying He is good! [He is a good Man!] Others said No He misleads and deceives the people [gives them false ideas]!
John,7,13,But no one dared speak out boldly about Him for fear of [the leaders of] the Jews.
John,7,14,When the Feast was already half over Jesus went up into the temple [ court] and began to teach.
John,7,15,The Jews were astonished. They said How is it that this Man has learning [is so versed in the sacred Scriptures and in theology] when He has never studied?
John,7,16,Jesus answered them by saying My teaching is not My own but His Who sent Me.
John,7,17,If any man desires to do His will (God's pleasure) he will know (have the needed illumination to recognize and can tell for himself) whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking from Myself and of My own accord and on My own authority.
John,7,18,He who speaks on his own authority seeks to win honor for himself. [He whose teaching originates with himself seeks his own glory.] But He Who seeks the glory and is eager for the honor of Him Who sent Him He is true; and there is no unrighteousness or falsehood or deception in Him.
John,7,19,Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not one of you keeps the Law. [If that is the truth] why do you seek to kill Me [for not keeping it]?
John,7,20,The crowd answered Him You are possessed by a demon! [You are raving!] Who seeks to kill You?
John,7,21,Jesus answered them I did one work and you all are astounded.
John,7,22,Now Moses established circumcision among you--though it did not originate with Moses but with the previous patriarchs--and you circumcise a person [even] on the Sabbath day.
John,7,23,If to avoid breaking the Law of Moses a person undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath day have you any cause to be angry with (indignant with bitter against) Me for making a man's whole body well on the Sabbath?
John,7,24,Be honest in your judgment and do not decide at a glance (superficially and by appearances); but judge fairly and righteously.
John,7,25,Then some of the Jerusalem people said Is not this the Man they seek to kill?
John,7,26,And here He is speaking openly and they say nothing to Him! Can it be possible that the rulers have discovered and know that this is truly the Christ?
John,7,27,No we know where this Man comes from; when the Christ arrives no one is to know from what place He comes.
John,7,28,Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught in the temple [ porches] Do you know Me and do you know where I am from? I have not come on My own authority and of My own accord and as self-appointed but the One Who sent Me is true (real genuine steadfast); and Him you do not know!
John,7,29,I know Him [Myself] because I come from His [very] presence and it was He [personally] Who sent Me.
John,7,30,Therefore they were eager to arrest Him but no one laid a hand on Him for His hour (time) had not yet come.
John,7,31,And besides many of the multitude believed in Him [adhered to Him trusted in Him relied on Him]. And they kept saying When the Christ comes will He do [can He be expected to do] more miracles and produce more proofs and signs than what this Man has done?
John,7,32,The Pharisees learned how the people were saying these things about Him under their breath; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent attendants (guards) to arrest Him.
John,7,33,Therefore Jesus said For a little while I am [still] with you and then I go back to Him Who sent Me.
John,7,34,You will look for Me but you will not [be able to] find Me; where I am you cannot come.
John,7,35,Then the Jews said among themselves Where does this Man intend to go that we shall not find Him? Will He go to the Jews who are scattered in the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
John,7,36,What does this statement of His mean You will look for Me and not be able to find Me and Where I am you cannot come?
John,7,37,Now on the final and most important day of the Feast Jesus stood and He cried in a loud voice If any man is thirsty let him come to Me and drink!
John,7,38,He who believes in Me [who cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me] as the Scripture has said From his innermost being shall flow [continuously] springs and rivers of living water.
John,7,39,But He was speaking here of the Spirit Whom those who believed (trusted had faith) in Him were afterward to receive. For the [Holy] Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus was not yet glorified (raised to honor).
John,7,40,Listening to those words some of the multitude said This is certainly and beyond doubt the Prophet!
John,7,41,Others said This is the Christ (the Messiah Anointed One)! But some said What? Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
John,7,42,Does not the Scripture tell us that the Christ will come from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem the village where David lived?
John,7,43,So there arose a division and dissension among the people concerning Him.
John,7,44,Some of them wanted to arrest Him but no one [ventured and] laid hands on Him.
John,7,45,Meanwhile the attendants (guards) had gone back to the chief priests and Pharisees who asked them Why have you not brought Him here with you?
John,7,46,The attendants replied Never has a man talked as this Man talks! [No mere man has ever spoken as He speaks!]
John,7,47,The Pharisees said to them Are you also deluded and led astray? [Are you also swept off your feet?]
John,7,48,Has any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in Him?
John,7,49,As for this multitude (rabble) that does not know the Law they are contemptible and doomed and accursed!
John,7,50,Then Nicodemus who came to Jesus before at night and was one of them asked
John,7,51,Does our Law convict a man without giving him a hearing and finding out what he has done?
John,7,52,They answered him Are you too from Galilee? Search [the Scriptures yourself] and you will see that no prophet comes (will rise to prominence) from Galilee.
John,7,53,And they went [back] each to his own house.
John,8,1,BUT JESUS went to the Mount of Olives.
John,8,2,Early in the morning (at dawn) He came back into the temple [ court] and the people came to Him in crowds. He sat down and was teaching them
John,8,3,When the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. They made her stand in the middle of the court and put the case before Him.
John,8,4,Teacher they said This woman has been caught in the very act of adultery.
John,8,5,Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such [women--offenders] shall be stoned to death. But what do You say [to do with her--what is Your sentence]?
John,8,6,This they said to try (test) Him hoping they might find a charge on which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger.
John,8,7,However when they persisted with their question He raised Himself up and said Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.
John,8,8,Then He bent down and went on writing on the ground with His finger.
John,8,9,They listened to Him and then they began going out conscience-stricken one by one from the oldest down to the last one of them till Jesus was left alone with the woman standing there before Him in the center of the court.
John,8,10,When Jesus raised Himself up He said to her Woman where are your accusers? Has no man condemned you?
John,8,11,She answered No one Lord! And Jesus said I do not condemn you either. Go on your way and from now on sin no more.
John,8,12,Once more Jesus addressed the crowd. He said I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark but will have the Light which is Life.
John,8,13,Whereupon the Pharisees told Him You are testifying on Your own behalf; Your testimony is not valid and is worthless.
John,8,14,Jesus answered Even if I do testify on My own behalf My testimony is true and reliable and valid for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
John,8,15,You [set yourselves up to] judge according to the flesh (by what you see). [You condemn by external human standards.] I do not [set Myself up to] judge or condemn or sentence anyone.
John,8,16,Yet even if I do judge My judgment is true [My decision is right]; for I am not alone [in making it] but [there are two of Us] I and the Father Who sent Me.
John,8,17,In your [own] Law it is written that the testimony (evidence) of two persons is reliable and valid.
John,8,18,I am One [of the Two] bearing testimony concerning Myself; and My Father Who sent Me He also testifies about Me.
John,8,19,Then they said to Him Where is this Father of Yours? Jesus answered You know My Father as little as you know Me. If you knew Me you would know My Father also.
John,8,20,Jesus said these things in the treasury while He was teaching in the temple [ court]; but no one ventured to arrest Him because His hour had not yet come.
John,8,21,Therefore He said again to them I am going away and you will be looking for Me and you will die in (under the curse of) your sin. Where I am going it is not possible for you to come.
John,8,22,At this the Jews began to ask among themselves Will He kill Himself? Is that why He says Where I am going it is not possible for you to come?
John,8,23,He said to them You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world (of this earthly order); I am not of this world.
John,8,24,That is why I told you that you will die in (under the curse of) your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He [Whom I claim to be--if you do not adhere to trust in and rely on Me] you will die in your sins.
John,8,25,Then they said to Him Who are You anyway? Jesus replied [Why do I even speak to you!] I am exactly what I have been telling you from the first.
John,8,26,I have much to say about you and to judge and condemn. But He Who sent Me is true (reliable) and I tell the world [only] the things that I have heard from Him.
John,8,27,They did not perceive (know understand) that He was speaking to them about the Father.
John,8,28,So Jesus added When you have lifted up the Son of Man [on the cross] you will realize (know understand) that I am He [for Whom you look] and that I do nothing of Myself (of My own accord or on My own authority) but I say [exactly] what My Father has taught Me.
John,8,29,And He Who sent Me is ever with Me; My Father has not left Me alone for I always do what pleases Him.
John,8,30,As He said these things many believed in Him [trusted relied on and adhered to Him].
John,8,31,So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him If you abide in My word [hold fast to My teachings and live in accordance with them] you are truly My disciples.
John,8,32,And you will know the Truth and the Truth will set you free.
John,8,33,They answered Him We are Abraham's offspring (descendants) and have never been in bondage to anybody. What do You mean by saying You will be set free?
John,8,34,Jesus answered them I assure you most solemnly I tell you Whoever commits and practices sin is the slave of sin.
John,8,35,Now a slave does not remain in a household permanently (forever); the son [of the house] does remain forever.
John,8,36,So if the Son liberates you [makes you free men] then you are really and unquestionably free.
John,8,37,[Yes] I know that you are Abraham's offspring; yet you plan to kill Me because My word has no entrance (makes no progress does not find any place) in you.
John,8,38,I tell the things which I have seen and learned at My Father's side and your actions also reflect what you have heard and learned from your father.
John,8,39,They retorted Abraham is our father. Jesus said If you were [truly] Abraham's children then you would do the works of Abraham [follow his example do as Abraham did].
John,8,40,But now [instead] you are wanting and seeking to kill Me a Man Who has told you the truth which I have heard from God. This is not the way Abraham acted.
John,8,41,You are doing the works of your [own] father. They said to Him We are not illegitimate children and born out of fornication; we have one Father even God.
John,8,42,Jesus said to them If God were your Father you would love Me and respect Me and welcome Me gladly for I proceeded (came forth) from God [out of His very presence]. I did not even come on My own authority or of My own accord (as self-appointed); but He sent Me.
John,8,43,Why do you misunderstand what I say? It is because you are unable to hear what I am saying. [You cannot bear to listen to My message; your ears are shut to My teaching.]
John,8,44,You are of your father the devil and it is your will to practice the lusts and gratify the desires [which are characteristic] of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a falsehood he speaks what is natural to him for he is a liar [himself] and the father of lies and of all that is false.
John,8,45,But because I speak the truth you do not believe Me [do not trust Me do not rely on Me or adhere to Me].
John,8,46,Who of you convicts Me of wrongdoing or finds Me guilty of sin? Then if I speak truth why do you not believe Me [trust Me rely on and adhere to Me]?
John,8,47,Whoever is of God listens to God. [Those who belong to God hear the words of God.] This is the reason that you do not listen [to those words to Me]: because you do not belong to God and are not of God or in harmony with Him.
John,8,48,The Jews answered Him Are we not right when we say You are a Samaritan and that You have a demon [that You are under the power of an evil spirit]?
John,8,49,Jesus answered I am not possessed by a demon. On the contrary I honor and reverence My Father and you dishonor (despise vilify and scorn) Me.
John,8,50,However I am not in search of honor for Myself. [I do not seek and am not aiming for My own glory.] There is One Who [looks after that; He] seeks [My glory] and He is the Judge.
John,8,51,I assure you most solemnly I tell you if anyone observes My teaching [lives in accordance with My message keeps My word] he will by no means ever see and experience death.
John,8,52,The Jews said to Him Now we know that You are under the power of a demon ( insane). Abraham died and also the prophets yet You say If a man keeps My word he will never taste of death into all eternity.
John,8,53,Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died and all the prophets died! Who do You make Yourself out to be?
John,8,54,Jesus answered If I were to glorify Myself (magnify praise and honor Myself) I would have no real glory for My glory would be nothing and worthless. [My honor must come to Me from My Father.] It is My Father Who glorifies Me [Who extols Me magnifies and praises Me] of Whom you say that He is your God.
John,8,55,Yet you do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him but I know Him. If I should say that I do not know Him I would be a liar like you. But I know Him and keep His word [obey His teachings am faithful to His message].
John,8,56,Your forefather Abraham was extremely happy at the hope and prospect of seeing My day (My incarnation); and he did see it and was delighted.
John,8,57,Then the Jews said to Him You are not yet fifty years old and have You seen Abraham?
John,8,58,Jesus replied I assure you most solemnly I tell you before Abraham was born I AM.
John,8,59,So they took up stones to throw at Him but Jesus by mixing with the crowd concealed Himself and went out of the temple [ enclosure].
John,9,1,AS HE passed along He noticed a man blind from his birth.
John,9,2,His disciples asked Him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he should be born blind?
John,9,3,Jesus answered It was not that this man or his parents sinned but he was born blind in order that the workings of God should be manifested (displayed and illustrated) in him.
John,9,4,We must work the works of Him Who sent Me and be busy with His business while it is daylight; night is coming on when no man can work.
John,9,5,As long as I am in the world I am the world's Light.
John,9,6,When He had said this He spat on the ground and made clay (mud) with His saliva and He spread it [as ointment] on the man's eyes.
John,9,7,And He said to him Go wash in the Pool of Siloam--which means Sent. So he went and washed and came back seeing.
John,9,8,When the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar saw him they said Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?
John,9,9,Some said It is he. Others said No but he looks very much like him. But he said Yes I am the man.
John,9,10,So they said to him How were your eyes opened?
John,9,11,He replied The Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me Go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and I obtained my sight!
John,9,12,They asked him Where is He? He said I do not know.
John,9,13,Then they conducted to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.
John,9,14,Now it was on the Sabbath day that Jesus mixed the mud and opened the man's eyes.
John,9,15,So now again the Pharisees asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them He smeared mud on my eyes and I washed and now I see.
John,9,16,Then some of the Pharisees said This Man [Jesus] is not from God because He does not observe the Sabbath. But others said How can a man who is a sinner (a bad man) do such signs and miracles? So there was a difference of opinion among them.
John,9,17,Accordingly they said to the blind man again What do you say about Him seeing that He opened your eyes? And he said He is [He must be] a prophet!
John,9,18,However the Jews did not believe that he had [really] been blind and that he had received his sight until they called (summoned) the parents of the man.
John,9,19,They asked them Is this your son whom you reported as having been born blind? How then does he see now?
John,9,20,His parents answered We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
John,9,21,But as to how he can now see we do not know; or who has opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age. Ask him; let him speak for himself and give his own account of it.
John,9,22,His parents said this because they feared [the leaders of] the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ he should be expelled and excluded from the synagogue.
John,9,23,On that account his parents said He is of age; ask him.
John,9,24,So the second time they summoned the man who had been born blind and said to him Now give God the glory (praise). This Fellow we know is only a sinner (a wicked person).
John,9,25,Then he answered I do not know whether He is a sinner and wicked or not. But one thing I do know that whereas I was blind before now I see.
John,9,26,So they said to him What did He [actually] do to you? How did He open your eyes?
John,9,27,He answered I already told you and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Can it be that you wish to become His disciples also?
John,9,28,And they stormed at him [they jeered they sneered they reviled him] and retorted You are His disciple yourself but we are the disciples of Moses.
John,9,29,We know for certain that God spoke with Moses but as for this Fellow we know nothing about where He hails from.
John,9,30,The man replied Well this is astonishing! Here a Man has opened my eyes and yet you do not know where He comes from. [That is amazing!]
John,9,31,We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and a worshiper of Him and does His will He listens to him.
John,9,32,Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
John,9,33,If this Man were not from God He would not be able to do anything like this.
John,9,34,They retorted You were wholly born in sin [from head to foot]; and do you [presume to] teach us? So they cast him out [threw him clear outside the synagogue].
John,9,35,Jesus heard that they had put him out and meeting him He said Do you believe in and adhere to the Son of Man or the Son of God?
John,9,36,He answered Who is He Sir? Tell me that I may believe in and adhere to Him.
John,9,37,Jesus said to him You have seen Him; [in fact] He is talking to you right now.
John,9,38,He called out Lord I believe! [I rely on I trust I cleave to You!] And he worshiped Him.
John,9,39,Then Jesus said I came into this world for judgment [as a Separator in order that there may be separation between those who believe on Me and those who reject Me] to make the sightless see and to make those who see become blind.
John,9,40,Some Pharisees who were near hearing this remark said to Him Are we also blind?
John,9,41,Jesus said to them If you were blind you would have no sin; but because you now claim to have sight your sin remains. [If you were blind you would not be guilty of sin; but because you insist We do see clearly you are unable to escape your guilt.]
John,10,1,I ASSURE you most solemnly I tell you he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold but climbs up some other way (elsewhere from some other quarter) is a thief and a robber.
John,10,2,But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John,10,3,The watchman opens the door for this man and the sheep listen to his voice and heed it; and he calls his own sheep by name and brings (leads) them out.
John,10,4,When he has brought his own sheep outside he walks on before them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
John,10,5,They will never [on any account] follow a stranger but will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers or recognize their call.
John,10,6,Jesus used this parable (illustration) with them but they did not understand what He was talking about.
John,10,7,So Jesus said again I assure you most solemnly I tell you that I Myself am the Door for the sheep.
John,10,8,All others who came [as such] before Me are thieves and robbers but the [true] sheep did not listen to and obey them.
John,10,9,I am the Door; anyone who enters in through Me will be saved (will live). He will come in and he will go out [freely] and will find pasture.
John,10,10,The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life and have it in abundance (to the full till it overflows).
John,10,11,I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd risks and lays down His [own] life for the sheep.
John,10,12,But the hired servant (he who merely serves for wages) who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep when he sees the wolf coming deserts the flock and runs away. And the wolf chases and snatches them and scatters [the flock].
John,10,13,Now the hireling flees because he merely serves for wages and is not himself concerned about the sheep [cares nothing for them].
John,10,14,I am the Good Shepherd; and I know and recognize My own and My own know and recognize Me--
John,10,15,Even as [truly as] the Father knows Me and I also know the Father--and I am giving My [very own] life and laying it down on behalf of the sheep.
John,10,16,And I have other sheep [beside these] that are not of this fold. I must bring and impel those also; and they will listen to My voice and heed My call and so there will be [they will become] one flock under one Shepherd.
John,10,17,For this [reason] the Father loves Me because I lay down My [own] life--to take it back again.
John,10,18,No one takes it away from Me. On the contrary I lay it down voluntarily. [I put it from Myself.] I am authorized and have power to lay it down (to resign it) and I am authorized and have power to take it back again. These are the instructions (orders) which I have received [as My charge] from My Father.
John,10,19,Then a fresh division of opinion arose among the Jews because of His saying these things.
John,10,20,And many of them said He has a demon and He is mad (insane--He raves He rambles). Why do you listen to Him?
John,10,21,Others argued These are not the thoughts and the language of one possessed. Can a demon-possessed person open blind eyes?
John,10,22,After this the Feast of Dedication [of the reconsecration of the temple] was taking place at Jerusalem. It was winter
John,10,23,And Jesus was walking in Solomon's Porch in the temple area.
John,10,24,So the Jews surrounded Him and began asking Him How long are You going to keep us in doubt and suspense? If You are really the Christ (the Messiah) tell us so plainly and openly.
John,10,25,Jesus answered them I have told you so yet you do not believe Me [you do not trust Me and rely on Me]. The very works that I do by the power of My Father and in My Father's name bear witness concerning Me [they are My credentials and evidence in support of Me].
John,10,26,But you do not believe and trust and rely on Me because you do not belong to My fold [you are no sheep of Mine].
John,10,27,The sheep that are My own hear and are listening to My voice; and I know them and they follow Me.
John,10,28,And I give them eternal life and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages. [To all eternity they shall never by any means be destroyed.] And no one is able to snatch them out of My hand.
John,10,29,My Father Who has given them to Me is greater and mightier than all [else]; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the Father's hand.
John,10,30,I and the Father are One.
John,10,31,Again the Jews brought up stones to stone Him.
John,10,32,Jesus said to them My Father has enabled Me to do many good deeds. [I have shown many acts of mercy in your presence.] For which of these do you mean to stone Me?
John,10,33,The Jews replied We are not going to stone You for a good act but for blasphemy because You a mere Man make Yourself [out to be] God.
John,10,34,Jesus answered Is it not written in your Law I said You are gods?
John,10,35,So men are called gods [by the Law] men to whom God's message came--and the Scripture cannot be set aside or cancelled or broken or annulled--
John,10,36,[If that is true] do you say of the One Whom the Father consecrated and dedicated and set apart for Himself and sent into the world You are blaspheming because I said I am the Son of God?
John,10,37,If I am not doing the works [performing the deeds] of My Father then do not believe Me [do not adhere to Me and trust Me and rely on Me].
John,10,38,But if I do them even though you do not believe Me or have faith in Me [at least] believe the works and have faith in what I do in order that you may know and understand [clearly] that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father [One with Him].
John,10,39,They sought again to arrest Him but He escaped from their hands.
John,10,40,He went back again across the Jordan to the locality where John was when he first baptized and there He remained.
John,10,41,And many came to Him and they kept saying John did not perform a [single] sign or miracle but everything John said about this Man was true.
John,10,42,And many [people] there became believers in Him. [They adhered to and trusted in and relied on Him.]
John,11,1,NOW A certain man named Lazarus was ill. He was of Bethany the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived.
John,11,2,This Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was [now] sick.
John,11,3,So the sisters sent to Him saying Lord he whom You love [so well] is sick.
John,11,4,When Jesus received the message He said This sickness is not to end in death; but [on the contrary] it is to honor God and to promote His glory that the Son of God may be glorified through (by) it.
John,11,5,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. [They were His dear friends and He held them in loving esteem.]
John,11,6,Therefore [even] when He heard that Lazarus was sick He still stayed two days longer in the same place where He was.
John,11,7,Then after that interval He said to His disciples Let us go back again to Judea.
John,11,8,The disciples said to Him Rabbi the Jews only recently were intending and trying to stone You and are You [thinking of] going back there again?
John,11,9,Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours in the day? Anyone who walks about in the daytime does not stumble because he sees [by] the light of this world.
John,11,10,But if anyone walks about in the night he does stumble because there is no light in him [the light is lacking to him].
John,11,11,He said these things and then added Our friend Lazarus is at rest and sleeping; but I am going there that I may awaken him out of his sleep.
John,11,12,The disciples answered Lord if he is sleeping he will recover.
John,11,13,However Jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that He referred to falling into a refreshing and natural sleep.
John,11,14,So then Jesus told them plainly Lazarus is dead
John,11,15,And for your sake I am glad that I was not there; it will help you to believe (to trust and rely on Me). However let us go to him.
John,11,16,Then Thomas who was called the Twin said to his fellow disciples Let us go too that we may die [be killed] along with Him.
John,11,17,So when Jesus arrived He found that he [Lazarus] had already been in the tomb four days.
John,11,18,Bethany was near Jerusalem only about two miles away
John,11,19,And a considerable number of the Jews had gone out to see Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.
John,11,20,When Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went to meet Him while Mary remained sitting in the house.
John,11,21,Martha then said to Jesus Master if You had been here my brother would not have died.
John,11,22,And even now I know that whatever You ask from God He will grant it to You.
John,11,23,Jesus said to her Your brother shall rise again.
John,11,24,Martha replied I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John,11,25,Jesus said to her I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in (adheres to trusts in and relies on) Me although he may die yet he shall live;
John,11,26,And whoever continues to live and believes in (has faith in cleaves to and relies on) Me shall never [actually] die at all. Do you believe this?
John,11,27,She said to Him Yes Lord I have believed [I do believe] that You are the Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) the Son of God [even He] Who was to come into the world. [It is for Your coming that the world has waited.]
John,11,28,After she had said this she went back and called her sister Mary privately whispering to her The Teacher is close at hand and is asking for you.
John,11,29,When she heard this she sprang up quickly and went to Him.
John,11,30,Now Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the same spot where Martha had met Him.
John,11,31,When the Jews who were sitting with her in the house and consoling her saw how hastily Mary had arisen and gone out they followed her supposing that she was going to the tomb to pour out her grief there.
John,11,32,When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw Him she dropped down at His feet saying to Him Lord if You had been here my brother would not have died.
John,11,33,When Jesus saw her sobbing and the Jews who came with her [also] sobbing He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. [He chafed in spirit and sighed and was disturbed.]
John,11,34,And He said Where have you laid him? They said to Him Lord come and see.
John,11,35,Jesus wept.
John,11,36,The Jews said See how [tenderly] He loved him!
John,11,37,But some of them said Could not He Who opened a blind man's eyes have prevented this man from dying?
John,11,38,Now Jesus again sighing repeatedly and deeply disquieted approached the tomb. It was a cave (a hole in the rock) and a boulder lay against [the entrance to close] it.
John,11,39,Jesus said Take away the stone. Martha the sister of the dead man exclaimed But Lord by this time he [is decaying and] throws off an offensive odor for he has been dead four days!
John,11,40,Jesus said to her Did I not tell you and promise you that if you would believe and rely on Me you would see the glory of God?
John,11,41,So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said Father I thank You that You have heard Me.
John,11,42,Yes I know You always hear and listen to Me but I have said this on account of and for the benefit of the people standing around so that they may believe that You did send Me [that You have made Me Your Messenger].
John,11,43,When He had said this He shouted with a loud voice Lazarus come out!
John,11,44,And out walked the man who had been dead his hands and feet wrapped in burial cloths (linen strips) and with a [burial] napkin bound around his face. Jesus said to them Free him of the burial wrappings and let him go.
John,11,45,Upon seeing what Jesus had done many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed in Him. [They trusted in Him and adhered to Him and relied on Him.]
John,11,46,But some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
John,11,47,So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council (the Sanhedrin) and said What are we to do? For this Man performs many signs (evidences miracles).
John,11,48,If we let Him alone to go on like this everyone will believe in Him and adhere to Him and the Romans will come and suppress and destroy and take away our [holy] place and our nation [ our temple and city and our civil organization].
John,11,49,But one of them Caiaphas who was the high priest that year declared You know nothing at all!
John,11,50,Nor do you understand or reason out that it is expedient and better for your own welfare that one man should die on behalf of the people than that the whole nation should perish (be destroyed ruined).
John,11,51,Now he did not say this simply of his own accord [he was not self-moved]; but being the high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation
John,11,52,And not only for the nation but also for the purpose of uniting into one body the children of God who have been scattered far and wide.
John,11,53,So from that day on they took counsel and plotted together how they might put Him to death.
John,11,54,For that reason Jesus no longer appeared publicly among the Jews but left there and retired to the district that borders on the wilderness (the desert) to a village called Ephraim and there He stayed with the disciples.
John,11,55,Now the Jewish Passover was at hand and many from the country went up to Jerusalem in order that they might purify and consecrate themselves before the Passover.
John,11,56,So they kept looking for Jesus and questioned among themselves as they were standing about in the temple [ area] What do you think? Will He not come to the Feast at all?
John,11,57,Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was he should report it to them so that they might arrest Him.
John,12,1,SO SIX days before the Passover Feast Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was who had died and whom He had raised from the dead.
John,12,2,So they made Him a supper; and Martha served but Lazarus was one of those at the table with Him.
John,12,3,Mary took a pound of ointment of pure liquid nard [a rare perfume] that was very expensive and she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped them with her hair. And the whole house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
John,12,4,But Judas Iscariot the one of His disciples who was about to betray Him said
John,12,5,Why was this perfume not sold for 300 denarii [a year's wages for an ordinary workman] and that [money] given to the poor (the destitute)?
John,12,6,Now he did not say this because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief; and having the bag (the money box the purse of the Twelve) he took for himself what was put into it [pilfering the collections].
John,12,7,But Jesus said Let her alone. It was [intended] that she should keep it for the time of My preparation for burial. [She has kept it that she might have it for the time of My embalming.]
John,12,8,You always have the poor with you but you do not always have Me.
John,12,9,Now a great crowd of the Jews heard that He was at Bethany and they came there not only because of Jesus but that they also might see Lazarus whom He had raised from the dead.
John,12,10,So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also
John,12,11,Because on account of him many of the Jews were going away [were withdrawing from and leaving the Judeans] and believing in and adhering to Jesus.
John,12,12,The next day a vast crowd of those who had come to the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
John,12,13,So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And as they went they kept shouting Hosanna! Blessed is He and praise to Him Who comes in the name of the Lord even the King of Israel!
John,12,14,And Jesus having found a young donkey rode upon it [just] as it is written in the Scriptures
John,12,15,Do not fear O Daughter of Zion! Look! Your King is coming sitting on a donkey's colt!
John,12,16,His disciples did not understand and could not comprehend the meaning of these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified and exalted they remembered that these things had been written about Him and had been done to Him.
John,12,17,The group that had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead kept telling it [bearing witness] to others.
John,12,18,It was for this reason that the crowd went out to meet Him because they had heard that He had performed this sign (proof miracle).
John,12,19,Then the Pharisees said among themselves You see how futile your efforts are and how you accomplish nothing. See! The whole world is running after Him!
John,12,20,Now among those who went up to worship at the Feast were some Greeks.
John,12,21,These came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee and they made this request Sir we desire to see Jesus.
John,12,22,Philip came and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip together [went] and told Jesus.
John,12,23,And Jesus answered them The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted.
John,12,24,I assure you most solemnly I tell you Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains [just one grain; it never becomes more but lives] by itself alone. But if it dies it produces many others and yields a rich harvest.
John,12,25,Anyone who loves his life loses it but anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal. [Whoever has no love for no concern for no regard for his life here on earth but despises it preserves his life forever and ever.]
John,12,26,If anyone serves Me he must continue to follow Me [ to cleave steadfastly to Me conform wholly to My example in living and if need be in dying] and wherever I am there will My servant be also. If anyone serves Me the Father will honor him.
John,12,27,Now My soul is troubled and distressed and what shall I say? Father save Me from this hour [of trial and agony]? But it was for this very purpose that I have come to this hour [that I might undergo it].
John,12,28,[Rather I will say] Father glorify (honor and extol) Your [own] name! Then there came a voice out of heaven saying I have already glorified it and I will glorify it again.
John,12,29,The crowd of bystanders heard the sound and said that it had thundered; others said An angel has spoken to Him!
John,12,30,Jesus answered This voice has not come for My sake but for your sake.
John,12,31,Now the judgment (crisis) of this world is coming on [sentence is now being passed on this world]. Now the ruler (evil genius prince) of this world shall be cast out (expelled).
John,12,32,And I if and when I am lifted up from the earth [on the cross] will draw and attract all men [Gentiles as well as Jews] to Myself.
John,12,33,He said this to signify in what manner He would die.
John,12,34,At this the people answered Him We have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; how then can You say The Son of Man must be lifted up [on the cross]? Who is this Son of Man?
John,12,35,So Jesus said to them You will have the Light only a little while longer. Walk while you have the Light [keep on living by it] so that darkness may not overtake and overcome you. He who walks about in the dark does not know where he goes [he is drifting].
John,12,36,While you have the Light believe in the Light [have faith in it hold to it rely on it] that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with Light. Jesus said these things and then He went away and hid Himself from them [was lost to their view].
John,12,37,Even though He had done so many miracles before them (right before their eyes) yet they still did not trust in Him and failed to believe in Him--
John,12,38,So that what Isaiah the prophet said was fulfilled: Lord who has believed our report and our message? And to whom has the arm (the power) of the Lord been shown (unveiled and revealed)?
John,12,39,Therefore they could not believe [they were unable to believe]. For Isaiah has also said
John,12,40,He has blinded their eyes and hardened and benumbed their [callous degenerated] hearts [He has made their minds dull] to keep them from seeing with their eyes and understanding with their hearts and minds and repenting and turning to Me to heal them.
John,12,41,Isaiah said this because he saw His glory and spoke of Him.
John,12,42,And yet [in spite of all this] many even of the leading men (the authorities and the nobles) believed and trusted in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess it for fear that [if they should acknowledge Him] they would be expelled from the synagogue;
John,12,43,For they loved the approval and the praise and the glory that come from men [instead of and] more than the glory that comes from God. [They valued their credit with men more than their credit with God.]
John,12,44,But Jesus loudly declared The one who believes in Me does not [only] believe in and trust in and rely on Me but [in believing in Me he believes] in Him Who sent Me.
John,12,45,And whoever sees Me sees Him Who sent Me.
John,12,46,I have come as a Light into the world so that whoever believes in Me [whoever cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me] may not continue to live in darkness.
John,12,47,If anyone hears My teachings and fails to observe them [does not keep them but disregards them] it is not I who judges him. For I have not come to judge and to condemn and to pass sentence and to inflict penalty on the world but to save the world.
John,12,48,Anyone who rejects Me and persistently sets Me at naught refusing to accept My teachings has his judge [however]; for the [very] message that I have spoken will itself judge and convict him at the last day.
John,12,49,This is because I have never spoken on My own authority or of My own accord or as self-appointed but the Father Who sent Me has Himself given Me orders [concerning] what to say and what to tell.
John,12,50,And I know that His commandment is (means) eternal life. So whatever I speak I am saying [exactly] what My Father has told Me to say and in accordance with His instructions.
John,13,1,[NOW] BEFORE the Passover Feast began Jesus knew (was fully aware) that the time had come for Him to leave this world and return to the Father. And as He had loved those who were His own in the world He loved them to the last and to the highest degree.
John,13,2,So [it was] during supper Satan having already put the thought of betraying Jesus in the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son
John,13,3,[That] Jesus knowing (fully aware) that the Father had put everything into His hands and that He had come from God and was [now] returning to God
John,13,4,Got up from supper took off His garments and taking a [servant's] towel He fastened it around His waist.
John,13,5,Then He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the [servant's] towel with which He was girded.
John,13,6,When He came to Simon Peter [Peter] said to Him Lord are my feet to be washed by You? [Is it for You to wash my feet?]
John,13,7,Jesus said to him You do not understand now what I am doing but you will understand later on.
John,13,8,Peter said to Him You shall never wash my feet! Jesus answered him Unless I wash you you have no part with ( in) Me [you have no share in companionship with Me].
John,13,9,Simon Peter said to Him Lord [wash] not only my feet but my hands and my head too!
John,13,10,Jesus said to him Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet but is clean all over. And you [My disciples] are clean but not all of you.
John,13,11,For He knew who was going to betray Him; that was the reason He said Not all of you are clean.
John,13,12,So when He had finished washing their feet and had put on His garments and had sat down again He said to them Do you understand what I have done to you?
John,13,13,You call Me the Teacher (Master) and the Lord and you are right in doing so for that is what I am.
John,13,14,If I then your Lord and Teacher (Master) have washed your feet you ought [it is your duty you are under obligation you owe it] to wash one another's feet.
John,13,15,For I have given you this as an example so that you should do [in your turn] what I have done to you.
John,13,16,I assure you most solemnly I tell you A servant is not greater than his master and no one who is sent is superior to the one who sent him.
John,13,17,If you know these things blessed and happy and to be envied are you if you practice them [if you act accordingly and really do them].
John,13,18,I am not speaking of and I do not mean all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled He who eats My bread with Me has raised up his heel against Me.
John,13,19,I tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does take place you may be persuaded and believe that I am He [Who I say I am--the Christ the Anointed One the Messiah].
John,13,20,I assure you most solemnly I tell you he who receives and welcomes and takes into his heart any messenger of Mine receives Me [in just that way]; and he who receives and welcomes and takes Me into his heart receives Him Who sent Me [in that same way].
John,13,21,After Jesus had said these things He was troubled (disturbed agitated) in spirit and said I assure you most solemnly I tell you one of you will deliver Me up [one of you will be false to Me and betray Me]!
John,13,22,The disciples kept looking at one another puzzled as to whom He could mean.
John,13,23,One of His disciples whom Jesus loved [whom He esteemed and delighted in] was reclining [next to Him] on Jesus' bosom.
John,13,24,So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask of whom He was speaking.
John,13,25,Then leaning back against Jesus' breast he asked Him Lord who is it?
John,13,26,Jesus answered It is the one to whom I am going to give this morsel (bit) of food after I have dipped it. So when He had dipped the morsel of bread [into the dish] He gave it to Judas Simon Iscariot's son.
John,13,27,Then after [he had taken] the bit of food Satan entered into and took possession of [Judas]. Jesus said to him What you are going to do do more swiftly than you seem to intend and make quick work of it.
John,13,28,But nobody reclining at the table knew why He spoke to him or what He meant by telling him this.
John,13,29,Some thought that since Judas had the money box (the purse) Jesus was telling him Buy what we need for the Festival or that he should give something to the poor.
John,13,30,So after receiving the bit of bread he went out immediately. And it was night.
John,13,31,When he had left Jesus said Now is the Son of Man glorified! [Now He has achieved His glory His honor His exaltation!] And God has been glorified through and in Him.
John,13,32,And if God is glorified through and in Him God will also glorify Him in Himself and He will glorify Him at once and not delay.
John,13,33,[Dear] little children I am to be with you only a little longer. You will look for Me and as I told the Jews so I tell you now: you are not able to come where I am going.
John,13,34,I give you a new commandment: that you should love one another. Just as I have loved you so you too should love one another.
John,13,35,By this shall all [men] know that you are My disciples if you love one another [if you keep on showing love among yourselves].
John,13,36,Simon Peter said to Him Lord where are You going? Jesus answered You are not able to follow Me now where I am going but you shall follow Me afterwards.
John,13,37,Peter said to Him Lord why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.
John,13,38,Jesus answered Will you [really] lay down your life for Me? I assure you most solemnly I tell you before a rooster crows you will deny Me [completely disown Me] three times.
John,14,1,DO NOT let your hearts be troubled (distressed agitated). You believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely on God; believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely also on Me.
John,14,2,In My Father's house there are many dwelling places (homes). If it were not so I would have told you; for I am going away to prepare a place for you.
John,14,3,And when (if) I go and make ready a place for you I will come back again and will take you to Myself that where I am you may be also.
John,14,4,And [to the place] where I am going you know the way.
John,14,5,Thomas said to Him Lord we do not know where You are going so how can we know the way?
John,14,6,Jesus said to him I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me.
John,14,7,If you had known Me [had learned to recognize Me] you would also have known My Father. From now on you know Him and have seen Him.
John,14,8,Philip said to Him Lord show us the Father [cause us to see the Father--that is all we ask]; then we shall be satisfied.
John,14,9,Jesus replied Have I been with all of you for so long a time and do you not recognize and know Me yet Philip? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say then Show us the Father?
John,14,10,Do you not believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in Me? What I am telling you I do not say on My own authority and of My own accord; but the Father Who lives continually in Me does the ( His) works (His own miracles deeds of power).
John,14,11,Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the sake of the [very] works themselves. [If you cannot trust Me at least let these works that I do in My Father's name convince you.]
John,14,12,I assure you most solemnly I tell you if anyone steadfastly believes in Me he will himself be able to do the things that I do; and he will do even greater things than these because I go to the Father.
John,14,13,And I will do [I Myself will grant] whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM] so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in (through) the Son.
John,14,14,[Yes] I will grant [I Myself will do for you] whatever you shall ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM].
John,14,15,If you [really] love Me you will keep (obey) My commands.
John,14,16,And I will ask the Father and He will give you another Comforter (Counselor Helper Intercessor Advocate Strengthener and Standby) that He may remain with you forever--
John,14,17,The Spirit of Truth Whom the world cannot receive (welcome take to its heart) because it does not see Him or know and recognize Him. But you know and recognize Him for He lives with you [constantly] and will be in you.
John,14,18,I will not leave you as orphans [comfortless desolate bereaved forlorn helpless]; I will come [back] to you.
John,14,19,Just a little while now and the world will not see Me any more but you will see Me; because I live you will live also.
John,14,20,At that time [when that day comes] you will know [for yourselves] that I am in My Father and you [are] in Me and I [am] in you.
John,14,21,The person who has My commands and keeps them is the one who [really] loves Me; and whoever [really] loves Me will be loved by My Father and I [too] will love him and will show (reveal manifest) Myself to him. [I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him.]
John,14,22,Judas not Iscariot asked Him Lord how is it that You will reveal Yourself [make Yourself real] to us and not to the world?
John,14,23,Jesus answered If a person [really] loves Me he will keep My word [obey My teaching]; and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make Our home (abode special dwelling place) with him.
John,14,24,Anyone who does not [really] love Me does not observe and obey My teaching. And the teaching which you hear and heed is not Mine but [comes] from the Father Who sent Me.
John,14,25,I have told you these things while I am still with you.
John,14,26,But the Comforter (Counselor Helper Intercessor Advocate Strengthener Standby) the Holy Spirit Whom the Father will send in My name [in My place to represent Me and act on My behalf] He will teach you all things. And He will cause you to recall (will remind you of bring to your remembrance) everything I have told you.
John,14,27,Peace I leave with you; My [own] peace I now give and bequeath to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid. [Stop allowing yourselves to be agitated and disturbed; and do not permit yourselves to be fearful and intimidated and cowardly and unsettled.]
John,14,28,You heard Me tell you I am going away and I am coming [back] to you. If you [really] loved Me you would have been glad because I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater and mightier than I am.
John,14,29,And now I have told you [this] before it occurs so that when it does take place you may believe and have faith in and rely on Me.
John,14,30,I will not talk with you much more for the prince (evil genius ruler) of the world is coming. And he has no claim on Me. [He has nothing in common with Me; there is nothing in Me that belongs to him and he has no power over Me.]
John,14,31,But [ Satan is coming and] I do as the Father has commanded Me so that the world may know (be convinced) that I love the Father and that I do only what the Father has instructed Me to do. [I act in full agreement with His orders.] Rise let us go away from here.
John,15,1,I AM the True Vine and My Father is the Vinedresser.
John,15,2,Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit.
John,15,3,You are cleansed and pruned already because of the word which I have given you [the teachings I have discussed with you].
John,15,4,Dwell in Me and I will dwell in you. [Live in Me and I will live in you.] Just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in (being vitally united to) the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me.
John,15,5,I am the Vine; you are the branches. Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much (abundant) fruit. However apart from Me [cut off from vital union with Me] you can do nothing.
John,15,6,If a person does not dwell in Me he is thrown out like a [broken-off] branch and withers; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire and they are burned.
John,15,7,If you live in Me [abide vitally united to Me] and My words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts ask whatever you will and it shall be done for you.
John,15,8,When you bear (produce) much fruit My Father is honored and glorified and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of Mine.
John,15,9,I have loved you [just] as the Father has loved Me; abide in My love [ continue in His love with Me].
John,15,10,If you keep My commandments [if you continue to obey My instructions] you will abide in My love and live on in it just as I have obeyed My Father's commandments and live on in His love.
John,15,11,I have told you these things that My joy and delight may be in you and that your joy and gladness may be of full measure and complete and overflowing.
John,15,12,This is My commandment: that you love one another [just] as I have loved you.
John,15,13,No one has greater love [no one has shown stronger affection] than to lay down (give up) his own life for his friends.
John,15,14,You are My friends if you keep on doing the things which I command you to do.
John,15,15,I do not call you servants (slaves) any longer for the servant does not know what his master is doing (working out). But I have called you My friends because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from My Father. [I have revealed to you everything that I have learned from Him.]
John,15,16,You have not chosen Me but I have chosen you and I have appointed you [I have planted you] that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing and that your fruit may be lasting [that it may remain abide] so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name [as presenting all that I AM] He may give it to you.
John,15,17,This is what I command you: that you love one another.
John,15,18,If the world hates you know that it hated Me before it hated you.
John,15,19,If you belonged to the world the world would treat you with affection and would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world [no longer one with it] but I have chosen (selected) you out of the world the world hates (detests) you.
John,15,20,Remember that I told you A servant is not greater than his master [is not superior to him]. If they persecuted Me they will also persecute you; if they kept My word and obeyed My teachings they will also keep and obey yours.
John,15,21,But they will do all this to you [inflict all this suffering on you] because of [your bearing] My name and on My account for they do not know or understand the One Who sent Me.
John,15,22,If I had not come and spoken to them they would not be guilty of sin [would be blameless]; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John,15,23,Whoever hates Me also hates My Father.
John,15,24,If I had not done (accomplished) among them the works which no one else ever did they would not be guilty of sin. But [the fact is] now they have both seen [these works] and have hated both Me and My Father.
John,15,25,But [this is so] that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled They hated Me without a cause.
John,15,26,But when the Comforter (Counselor Helper Advocate Intercessor Strengthener Standby) comes Whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of Truth Who comes (proceeds) from the Father He [Himself] will testify regarding Me.
John,15,27,But you also will testify and be My witnesses because you have been with Me from the beginning.
John,16,1,I HAVE told you all these things so that you should not be offended (taken unawares and falter or be caused to stumble and fall away). [I told you to keep you from being scandalized and repelled.]
John,16,2,They will put you out of (expel you from) the synagogues; but an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think and claim that he has offered service to God.
John,16,3,And they will do this because they have not known the Father or Me.
John,16,4,But I have told you these things now so that when they occur you will remember that I told you of them. I did not say these things to you from the beginning because I was with you.
John,16,5,But now I am going to Him Who sent Me yet none of you asks Me Where are You going?
John,16,6,But because I have said these things to you sorrow has filled your hearts [taken complete possession of them].
John,16,7,However I am telling you nothing but the truth when I say it is profitable (good expedient advantageous) for you that I go away. Because if I do not go away the Comforter (Counselor Helper Advocate Intercessor Strengthener Standby) will not come to you [into close fellowship with you]; but if I go away I will send Him to you [to be in close fellowship with you].
John,16,8,And when He comes He will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin and about righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God) and about judgment:
John,16,9,About sin because they do not believe in Me [trust in rely on and adhere to Me];
John,16,10,About righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God) because I go to My Father and you will see Me no longer;
John,16,11,About judgment because the ruler (evil genius prince) of this world [Satan] is judged and condemned and sentence already is passed upon him.
John,16,12,I have still many things to say to you but you are not able to bear them or to take them upon you or to grasp them now.
John,16,13,But when He the Spirit of Truth (the Truth-giving Spirit) comes He will guide you into all the Truth (the whole full Truth). For He will not speak His own message [on His own authority]; but He will tell whatever He hears [from the Father; He will give the message that has been given to Him] and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [that will happen in the future].
John,16,14,He will honor and glorify Me because He will take of (receive draw upon) what is Mine and will reveal (declare disclose transmit) it to you.
John,16,15,Everything that the Father has is Mine. That is what I meant when I said that He [the Spirit] will take the things that are Mine and will reveal (declare disclose transmit) it to you.
John,16,16,In a little while you will no longer see Me and again after a short while you will see Me.
John,16,17,So some of His disciples questioned among themselves What does He mean when He tells us In a little while you will no longer see Me and again after a short while you will see Me and Because I go to My Father?
John,16,18,What does He mean by a little while? We do not know or understand what He is talking about.
John,16,19,Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him so He said to them Are you wondering and inquiring among yourselves what I meant when I said In a little while you will no longer see Me and again after a short while you will see Me?
John,16,20,I assure you most solemnly I tell you that you shall weep and grieve but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
John,16,21,A woman when she gives birth to a child has grief (anguish agony) because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child she no longer remembers her pain (trouble anguish) because she is so glad that a man (a child a human being) has been born into the world.
John,16,22,So for the present you are also in sorrow (in distress and depressed); but I will see you again and [then] your hearts will rejoice and no one can take from you your joy (gladness delight).
John,16,23,And when that time comes you will ask nothing of Me [you will need to ask Me no questions]. I assure you most solemnly I tell you that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM].
John,16,24,Up to this time you have not asked a [single] thing in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]; but now ask and keep on asking and you will receive so that your joy (gladness delight) may be full and complete.
John,16,25,I have told you these things in parables (veiled language allegories dark sayings); the hour is now coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech but I shall tell you about the Father in plain words and openly (without reserve).
John,16,26,At that time you will ask (pray) in My Name; and I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf [for it will be unnecessary].
John,16,27,For the Father Himself [tenderly] loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from the Father.
John,16,28,I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again I am leaving the world and going to the Father.
John,16,29,His disciples said Ah now You are speaking plainly to us and not in parables (veiled language and figures of speech)!
John,16,30,Now we know that You are acquainted with everything and have no need to be asked questions. Because of this we believe that you [really] came from God.
John,16,31,Jesus answered them Do you now believe? [Do you believe it at last?]
John,16,32,But take notice the hour is coming and it has arrived when you will all be dispersed and scattered every man to his own home leaving Me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with Me.
John,16,33,I have told you these things so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace and confidence. In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration; but be of good cheer [take courage; be confident certain undaunted]! For I have overcome the world. [I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you.]
John,17,1,WHEN JESUS had spoken these things He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said Father the hour has come. Glorify and exalt and honor and magnify Your Son so that Your Son may glorify and extol and honor and magnify You.
John,17,2,[Just as] You have granted Him power and authority over all flesh (all humankind) [now glorify Him] so that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.
John,17,3,And this is eternal life: [it means] to know (to perceive recognize become acquainted with and understand) You the only true and real God and [likewise] to know Him Jesus [as the] Christ (the Anointed One the Messiah) Whom You have sent.
John,17,4,I have glorified You down here on the earth by completing the work that You gave Me to do.
John,17,5,And now Father glorify Me along with Yourself and restore Me to such majesty and honor in Your presence as I had with You before the world existed.
John,17,6,I have manifested Your Name [I have revealed Your very Self Your real Self] to the people whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours and You gave them to Me and they have obeyed and kept Your word.
John,17,7,Now [at last] they know and understand that all You have given Me belongs to You [is really and truly Yours].
John,17,8,For the [uttered] words that You gave Me I have given them; and they have received and accepted [them] and have come to know positively and in reality [to believe with absolute assurance] that I came forth from Your presence and they have believed and are convinced that You did send Me.
John,17,9,I am praying for them. I am not praying (requesting) for the world but for those You have given Me for they belong to You.
John,17,10,All [things that are] Mine are Yours and all [things that are] Yours belong to Me; and I am glorified in (through) them. [They have done Me honor; in them My glory is achieved.]
John,17,11,And [now] I am no more in the world but these are [still] in the world and I am coming to You. Holy Father keep in Your Name [ in the knowledge of Yourself] those whom You have given Me that they may be one as We [are one].
John,17,12,While I was with them I kept and preserved them in Your Name [ in the knowledge and worship of You]. Those You have given Me I guarded and protected and not one of them has perished or is lost except the son of perdition [Judas Iscariot--the one who is now doomed to destruction destined to be lost] that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
John,17,13,And now I am coming to You; I say these things while I am still in the world so that My joy may be made full and complete and perfect in them [that they may experience My delight fulfilled in them that My enjoyment may be perfected in their own souls that they may have My gladness within them filling their hearts].
John,17,14,I have given and delivered to them Your word (message) and the world has hated them because they are not of the world [do not belong to the world] just as I am not of the world.
John,17,15,I do not ask that You will take them out of the world but that You will keep and protect them from the evil one.
John,17,16,They are not of the world (worldly belonging to the world) [just] as I am not of the world.
John,17,17,Sanctify them [purify consecrate separate them for Yourself make them holy] by the Truth; Your Word is Truth.
John,17,18,Just as You sent Me into the world I also have sent them into the world.
John,17,19,And so for their sake and on their behalf I sanctify (dedicate consecrate) Myself that they also may be sanctified (dedicated consecrated made holy) in the Truth.
John,17,20,Neither for these alone do I pray [it is not for their sake only that I make this request] but also for all those who will ever come to believe in (trust in cling to rely on) Me through their word and teaching
John,17,21,That they all may be one [just] as You Father are in Me and I in You that they also may be one in Us so that the world may believe and be convinced that You have sent Me.
John,17,22,I have given to them the glory and honor which You have given Me that they may be one [even] as We are one:
John,17,23,I in them and You in Me in order that they may become one and perfectly united that the world may know and [definitely] recognize that You sent Me and that You have loved them [even] as You have loved Me.
John,17,24,Father I desire that they also whom You have entrusted to Me [as Your gift to Me] may be with Me where I am so that they may see My glory which You have given Me [Your love gift to Me]; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
John,17,25,O just and righteous Father although the world has not known You and has failed to recognize You and has never acknowledged You I have known You [continually]; and these men understand and know that You have sent Me.
John,17,26,I have made Your Name known to them and revealed Your character and Your very Self and I will continue to make [You] known that the love which You have bestowed upon Me may be in them [felt in their hearts] and that I [Myself] may be in them.
John,18,1,HAVING SAID these things Jesus went out with His disciples beyond (across) the winter torrent of the Kidron [in the ravine]. There was a garden there which He and His disciples entered.
John,18,2,And Judas who was betraying Him and delivering Him up also knew the place because Jesus had often retired there with His disciples.
John,18,3,So Judas obtaining and taking charge of the band of soldiers and some guards (attendants) of the high priests and Pharisees came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John,18,4,Then Jesus knowing all that was about to befall Him went out to them and said Whom are you seeking? [Whom do you want?]
John,18,5,They answered Him Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them I am He. Judas who was betraying Him was also standing with them.
John,18,6,When Jesus said to them I am He they went backwards (drew back lurched backward) and fell to the ground.
John,18,7,Then again He asked them Whom are you seeking? And they said Jesus the Nazarene.
John,18,8,Jesus answered I told you that I am He. So if you want Me [if it is only I for Whom you are looking] let these men go their way.
John,18,9,Thus what He had said was fulfilled and verified Of those whom You have given Me I have not lost even one.
John,18,10,Then Simon Peter who had a sword drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
John,18,11,Therefore Jesus said to Peter Put the sword [back] into the sheath! The cup which My Father has given Me shall I not drink it?
John,18,12,So the troops and their captain and the guards (attendants) of the Jews seized Jesus and bound Him
John,18,13,And they brought Him first to Annas for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year.
John,18,14,It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was expedient and for their welfare that one man should die for (instead of in behalf of) the people.
John,18,15,Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. And that disciple was known to the high priest and so he entered along with Jesus into the court of the palace of the high priest;
John,18,16,But Peter was standing outside at the door. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter inside.
John,18,17,Then the maid who was in charge at the door said to Peter You are not also one of the disciples of this Man are you? He said I am not!
John,18,18,Now the servants and the guards (the attendants) had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they were standing and warming themselves. And Peter was with them standing and warming himself.
John,18,19,Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching.
John,18,20,Jesus answered him I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [area] where the Jews [habitually] congregate (assemble); and I have spoken nothing secretly.
John,18,21,Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard [Me] what I said to them. See! They know what I said.
John,18,22,But when He said this one of the attendants who stood by struck Jesus saying Is that how You answer the high priest?
John,18,23,Jesus replied If I have said anything wrong [if I have spoken abusively if there was evil in what I said] tell what was wrong with it. But if I spoke rightly and properly why do you strike Me?
John,18,24,Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
John,18,25,But Simon Peter [still] was standing and was warming himself. They said to him You are not also one of His disciples are you? He denied it and said I am not!
John,18,26,One of the high priest's servants a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off said Did I not see you in the garden with Him?
John,18,27,And again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed.
John,18,28,Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium (judgment hall governor's palace). And it was early. They themselves did not enter the Praetorium that they might not be defiled (become ceremonially unclean) but might be fit to eat the Passover [supper].
John,18,29,So Pilate went out to them and said What accusation do you bring against this Man?
John,18,30,They retorted If He were not an evildoer (criminal) we would not have handed Him over to you.
John,18,31,Pilate said to them Take Him yourselves and judge and sentence and punish Him according to your [own] law. The Jews answered It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.
John,18,32,This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show (indicate predict) by what manner of death He was to die.
John,18,33,So Pilate went back again into the judgment hall and called Jesus and asked Him Are You the King of the Jews?
John,18,34,Jesus replied Are you saying this of yourself [on your own initiative] or have others told you about Me?
John,18,35,Pilate answered Am I a Jew? Your [own] people and nation and their chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?
John,18,36,Jesus answered My kingdom (kingship royal power) belongs not to this world. If My kingdom were of this world My followers would have been fighting to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is My kingdom is not from here (this world); [it has no such origin or source].
John,18,37,Pilate said to Him Then You are a King? Jesus answered You say it! [You speak correctly!] For I am a King. [Certainly I am a King!] This is why I was born and for this I have come into the world to bear witness to the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth [who is a friend of the Truth who belongs to the Truth] hears and listens to My voice.
John,18,38,Pilate said to Him What is Truth? On saying this he went out to the Jews again and told them I find no fault in Him.
John,18,39,But it is your custom that I release one [prisoner] for you at the Passover. So shall I release for you the King of the Jews?
John,18,40,Then they all shouted back again Not Him [not this Man] but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber.
John,19,1,SO THEN Pilate took Jesus and scourged (flogged whipped) Him.
John,19,2,And the soldiers having twisted together a crown of thorns put it on His head and threw a purple cloak around Him.
John,19,3,And they kept coming to Him and saying Hail King of the Jews! [Good health to you! Peace to you! Long life to you King of the Jews!] And they struck Him with the palms of their hands.
John,19,4,Then Pilate went out again and said to them See I bring Him out to you so that you may know that I find no fault (crime cause for accusation) in Him.
John,19,5,So Jesus came out wearing the thorny crown and purple cloak and Pilate said to them See [here is] the Man!
John,19,6,When the chief priests and attendants (guards) saw Him they cried out Crucify Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them Take Him yourselves and crucify Him for I find no fault (crime) in Him.
John,19,7,The Jews answered him We have a law and according to that law He should die because He has claimed and made Himself out to be the Son of God.
John,19,8,So when Pilate heard this said he was more alarmed and awestricken and afraid than before.
John,19,9,He went into the judgment hall again and said to Jesus Where are You from? [To what world do You belong?] But Jesus did not answer him.
John,19,10,So Pilate said to Him Will You not speak [even] to me? Do You not know that I have power (authority) to release You and I have power to crucify You?
John,19,11,Jesus answered You would not have any power or authority whatsoever against (over) Me if it were not given you from above. For this reason the sin and guilt of the one who delivered Me over to you is greater.
John,19,12,Upon this Pilate wanted (sought was anxious) to release Him but the Jews kept shrieking If you release this Man you are no friend of Caesar! Anybody who makes himself [out to be] a king sets himself up against Caesar [is a rebel against the emperor]!
John,19,13,Hearing this Pilate brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement [the Mosaic Pavement the Stone Platform]--in Hebrew Gabbatha.
John,19,14,Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover and it was about the sixth hour (about twelve o'clock noon). He said to the Jews See [here is] your King!
John,19,15,But they shouted Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them Crucify your King? The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar!
John,19,16,Then he delivered Him over to them to be crucified.
John,19,17,And they took Jesus and led [Him] away; so He went out bearing His own cross to the spot called The Place of the Skull--in Hebrew it is called Golgotha.
John,19,18,There they crucified Him and with Him two others--one on either side and Jesus between them.
John,19,19,And Pilate also wrote a title (an inscription on a placard) and put it on the cross. And the writing was: Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews.
John,19,20,And many of the Jews read this title for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in Hebrew in Latin [and] in Greek.
John,19,21,Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate Do not write The King of the Jews but He said I am King of the Jews.
John,19,22,Pilate replied What I have written I have written.
John,19,23,Then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus took His garments and made four parts one share for each soldier and also the tunic (the long shirtlike undergarment). But the tunic was seamless woven [in one piece] from the top throughout.
John,19,24,So they said to one another Let us not tear it but let us cast lots to decide whose it shall be. This was to fulfill the Scripture They parted My garments among them and for My clothing they cast lots. So the soldiers did these things.
John,19,25,But by the cross of Jesus stood His mother His mother's sister Mary the [wife] of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.
John,19,26,So Jesus seeing His mother there and the disciple whom He loved standing near said to His mother [ Dear] woman See [here is] your son!
John,19,27,Then He said to the disciple See [here is] your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her into his own [keeping own home].
John,19,28,After this Jesus knowing that all was now finished (ended) said in fulfillment of the Scripture I thirst.
John,19,29,A vessel (jar) full of sour wine (vinegar) was placed there so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on [a stalk reed of] hyssop and held it to [His] mouth.
John,19,30,When Jesus had received the sour wine He said It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.
John,19,31,Since it was the day of Preparation in order to prevent the bodies from hanging on the cross on the Sabbath--for that Sabbath was a very solemn and important one--the Jews requested Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away.
John,19,32,So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first one and of the other who had been crucified with Him.
John,19,33,But when they came to Jesus and they saw that He was already dead they did not break His legs.
John,19,34,But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear and immediately blood and water came (flowed) out.
John,19,35,And he who saw it (the eyewitness) gives this evidence and his testimony is true; and he knows that he tells the truth that you may believe also.
John,19,36,For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled (verified carried out) Not one of His bones shall be broken;
John,19,37,And again another Scripture says They shall look on Him Whom they have pierced.
John,19,38,And after this Joseph of Arimathea--a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews--asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate granted him permission. So he came and took away His body.
John,19,39,And Nicodemus also who first had come to Jesus by night came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes [weighing] about a hundred pounds.
John,19,40,So they took Jesus' body and bound it in linen cloths with the spices (aromatics) as is the Jews' customary way to prepare for burial.
John,19,41,Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever [yet] been laid.
John,19,42,So there because of the Jewish day of Preparation [and] since the tomb was near by they laid Jesus.
John,20,1,NOW ON the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early while it was still dark and saw that the stone had been removed from (lifted out of the groove across the entrance of) the tomb.
John,20,2,So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus [tenderly] loved and said to them They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they have laid Him!
John,20,3,Upon this Peter and the other disciple came out and they went toward the tomb.
John,20,4,And they came running together but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first.
John,20,5,And stooping down he saw the linen cloths lying there but he did not enter.
John,20,6,Then Simon Peter came up following him and went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there;
John,20,7,But the burial napkin (kerchief) which had been around Jesus' head was not lying with the other linen cloths but was [still] rolled up (wrapped round and round) in a place by itself.
John,20,8,Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went in too; and he saw and was convinced and believed.
John,20,9,For as yet they did not know (understand) the statement of Scripture that He must rise again from the dead.
John,20,10,Then the disciples went back again to their homes (lodging places).
John,20,11,But Mary remained standing outside the tomb sobbing. As she wept she stooped down [and looked] into the tomb.
John,20,12,And she saw two angels in white sitting there one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.
John,20,13,And they said to her Woman why are you sobbing? She told them Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid Him.
John,20,14,On saying this she turned around and saw Jesus standing [there] but she did not know (recognize) that it was Jesus.
John,20,15,Jesus said to her Woman why are you crying [so]? For Whom are you looking? Supposing that it was the gardener she replied Sir if you carried Him away from here tell me where you have put Him and I will take Him away.
John,20,16,Jesus said to her Mary! Turning around she said to Him in Hebrew Rabboni!--which means Teacher or Master.
John,20,17,Jesus said to her Do not cling to Me [do not hold Me] for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to My brethren and tell them I am ascending to My Father and your Father and to My God and your God.
John,20,18,Away came Mary Magdalene bringing the disciples news (word) that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her.
John,20,19,Then on that same first day of the week when it was evening though the disciples were behind closed doors for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood among them and said Peace to you!
John,20,20,So saying He showed them His hands and His side. And when the disciples saw the Lord they were filled with joy (delight exultation ecstasy rapture).
John,20,21,Then Jesus said to them again Peace to you! [Just] as the Father has sent Me forth so I am sending you.
John,20,22,And having said this He breathed on them and said to them Receive the Holy Spirit!
John,20,23,[Now having received the Holy Spirit and being led and directed by Him] if you forgive the sins of anyone they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of anyone they are retained.
John,20,24,But Thomas one of the Twelve called the Twin was not with them when Jesus came.
John,20,25,So the other disciples kept telling him We have seen the Lord! But he said to them Unless I see in His hands the marks made by the nails and put my finger into the nail prints and put my hand into His side I will never believe [it].
John,20,26,Eight days later His disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Jesus came though they were behind closed doors and stood among them and said Peace to you!
John,20,27,Then He said to Thomas Reach out your finger here and see My hands; and put out your hand and place [it] in My side. Do not be faithless and incredulous but [stop your unbelief and] believe!
John,20,28,Thomas answered Him My Lord and my God!
John,20,29,Jesus said to him Because you have seen Me Thomas do you now believe (trust have faith)? Blessed and happy and to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me.
John,20,30,There are also many other signs and miracles which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book.
John,20,31,But these are written (recorded) in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ (the Anointed One) the Son of God and that through believing and cleaving to and trusting and relying upon Him you may have life through (in) His name [ through Who He is].
John,21,1,AFTER THIS Jesus let Himself be seen and revealed [Himself] again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He did it in this way:
John,21,2,There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called the Twin and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee also the sons of Zebedee and two others of His disciples.
John,21,3,Simon Peter said to them I am going fishing! They said to him And we are coming with you! So they went out and got into the boat and throughout that night they caught nothing.
John,21,4,Morning was already breaking when Jesus came to the beach and stood there. However the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
John,21,5,So Jesus said to them Boys (children) you do not have any meat (fish) do you? [Have you caught anything to eat along with your bread?] They answered Him No!
John,21,6,And He said to them Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find [some]. So they cast the net and now they were not able to haul it in for such a big catch (mass quantity) of fish [was in it].
John,21,7,Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter It is the Lord! Simon Peter hearing him say that it was the Lord put (girded) on his upper garment (his fisherman's coat his outer tunic)--for he was stripped [for work]--and sprang into the sea.
John,21,8,And the other disciples came in the small boat for they were not far from shore only some hundred yards away dragging the net full of fish.
John,21,9,When they got out on land (the beach) they saw a fire of coals there and fish lying on it [cooking] and bread.
John,21,10,Jesus said to them Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.
John,21,11,So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to land full of large fish 153 of them; and [though] there were so many of them the net was not torn.
John,21,12,Jesus said to them Come [and] have breakfast. But none of the disciples ventured or dared to ask Him Who are You? because they [well] knew that it was the Lord.
John,21,13,Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and so also [with] the fish.
John,21,14,This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself (appeared was manifest) to the disciples after He had risen from the dead.
John,21,15,When they had eaten Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John do you love Me more than these [others do--with reasoning intentional spiritual devotion as one loves the Father]? He said to Him Yes Lord You know that I love You [that I have deep instinctive personal affection for You as for a close friend]. He said to him Feed My lambs.
John,21,16,Again He said to him the second time Simon son of John do you love Me [with reasoning intentional spiritual devotion as one loves the Father]? He said to Him Yes Lord You know that I love You [that I have a deep instinctive personal affection for You as for a close friend]. He said to him Shepherd (tend) My sheep.
John,21,17,He said to him the third time Simon son of John do you love Me [with a deep instinctive personal affection for Me as for a close friend]? Peter was grieved (was saddened and hurt) that He should ask him the third time Do you love Me? And he said to Him Lord You know everything; You know that I love You [that I have a deep instinctive personal affection for You as for a close friend]. Jesus said to him Feed My sheep.
John,21,18,I assure you most solemnly I tell you when you were young you girded yourself [put on your own belt or girdle] and you walked about wherever you pleased to go. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will put a girdle around you and carry you where you do not wish to go.
John,21,19,He said this to indicate by what kind of death Peter would glorify God. And after this He said to him Follow Me!
John,21,20,But Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following--the one who also had leaned back on His breast at the supper and had said Lord who is it that is going to betray You?
John,21,21,When Peter saw him he said to Jesus Lord what about this man?
John,21,22,Jesus said to him If I want him to stay (survive live) until I come what is that to you? [What concern is it of yours?] You follow Me!
John,21,23,So word went out among the brethren that this disciple was not going to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die but If I want him to stay (survive live) till I come what is that to you?
John,21,24,It is this same disciple who is bearing witness to these things and who has recorded (written) them; and we [well] know that his testimony is true.
John,21,25,And there are also many other things which Jesus did. If they should be all recorded one by one [in detail] I suppose that even the world itself could not contain (have room for) the books that would be written.
Acts,1,1,IN THE former account [which I prepared] O Theophilus I made [a continuous report] dealing with all the things which Jesus began to do and to teach
Acts,1,2,Until the day when He ascended after He through the Holy Spirit had instructed and commanded the apostles (special messengers) whom He had chosen.
Acts,1,3,To them also He showed Himself alive after His passion (His suffering in the garden and on the cross) by [a series of] many convincing demonstrations [unquestionable evidences and infallible proofs] appearing to them during forty days and talking [to them] about the things of the kingdom of God.
Acts,1,4,And while being in their company and eating with them He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for what the Father had promised Of which [He said] you have heard Me speak.
Acts,1,5,For John baptized with water but not many days from now you shall be baptized with ( placed in introduced into) the Holy Spirit.
Acts,1,6,So when they were assembled they asked Him Lord is this the time when You will reestablish the kingdom and restore it to Israel?
Acts,1,7,He said to them It is not for you to become acquainted with and know what time brings [the things and events of time and their definite periods] or fixed years and seasons (their critical niche in time) which the Father has appointed (fixed and reserved) by His own choice and authority and personal power.
Acts,1,8,But you shall receive power (ability efficiency and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the ends (the very bounds) of the earth.
Acts,1,9,And when He had said this even as they were looking [at Him] He was caught up and a cloud received and carried Him away out of their sight.
Acts,1,10,And while they were gazing intently into heaven as He went behold two men [dressed] in white robes suddenly stood beside them
Acts,1,11,Who said Men of Galilee why do you stand gazing into heaven? This same Jesus Who was caught away and lifted up from among you into heaven will return in [just] the same way in which you saw Him go into heaven.
Acts,1,12,Then [the disciples] went back to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet which is near Jerusalem [only] a Sabbath day's journey (three-quarters of a mile) away.
Acts,1,13,And when they had entered [the city] they mounted [the stairs] to the upper room where they were [ indefinitely] staying--Peter and John and James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas [son] of James.
Acts,1,14,All of these with their minds in full agreement devoted themselves steadfastly to prayer [waiting together] with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with His brothers.
Acts,1,15,Now on one of those days Peter arose among the brethren the whole number of whom gathered together was about a hundred and twenty.
Acts,1,16,Brethren he said it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David about Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.
Acts,1,17,For he was counted among us and received [by divine allotment] his portion in this ministry.
Acts,1,18,Now this man obtained a piece of land with the [money paid him as a] reward for his treachery and wickedness and falling headlong he burst open in the middle [of his body] and all his intestines poured forth.
Acts,1,19,And all the residents of Jerusalem became acquainted with the facts so that they called the piece of land in their own dialect--Akeldama that is Field of Blood.
Acts,1,20,For in the book of Psalms it is written Let his place of residence become deserted and gloomy and let there be no one to live in it; and [again] Let another take his position or overseership.
Acts,1,21,So one of the [other] men who have accompanied us [apostles] during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us
Acts,1,22,From the baptism of John at the outset until the day when He was taken up from among us--one of these men must join with us and become a witness to testify to His resurrection.
Acts,1,23,And they accordingly proposed (nominated) two men Joseph called Barsabbas who was surnamed Justus and Matthias.
Acts,1,24,And they prayed and said You Lord Who know all hearts ( their thoughts passions desires appetites purposes and endeavors) indicate to us which one of these two You have chosen
Acts,1,25,To take the place in this ministry and receive the position of an apostle from which Judas fell away and went astray to go [where he belonged] to his own [proper] place.
Acts,1,26,And they drew lots [between the two] and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to and counted with the eleven apostles (special messengers).
Acts,2,1,AND WHEN the day of Pentecost had fully come they were all assembled together in one place
Acts,2,2,When suddenly there came a sound from heaven like the rushing of a violent tempest blast and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
Acts,2,3,And there appeared to them tongues resembling fire which were separated and distributed and which settled on each one of them.
Acts,2,4,And they were all filled (diffused throughout their souls) with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other (different foreign) languages (tongues) as the Spirit kept giving them clear and loud expression [in each tongue in appropriate words].
Acts,2,5,Now there were then residing in Jerusalem Jews devout and God-fearing men from every country under heaven.
Acts,2,6,And when this sound was heard the multitude came together and they were astonished and bewildered because each one heard them [the apostles] speaking in his own [particular] dialect.
Acts,2,7,And they were beside themselves with amazement saying Are not all these who are talking Galileans?
Acts,2,8,Then how is it that we hear each of us in our own (particular) dialect to which we were born?
Acts,2,9,Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia Judea and Cappadocia Pontus and [the province of] Asia
Acts,2,10,Phrygia and Pamphylia Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene and the transient residents from Rome both Jews and the proselytes [to Judaism from other religions]
Acts,2,11,Cretans and Arabians too--we all hear them speaking in our own native tongues [and telling of] the mighty works of God!
Acts,2,12,And all were beside themselves with amazement and were puzzled and bewildered saying one to another What can this mean?
Acts,2,13,But others made a joke of it and derisively said They are simply drunk and full of sweet [intoxicating] wine.
Acts,2,14,But Peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them: You Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem let this be [explained] to you so that you will know and understand; listen closely to what I have to say.
Acts,2,15,For these men are not drunk as you imagine for it is [only] the third hour (about 9:00 a.m.) of the day;
Acts,2,16,But [instead] this is [the beginning of] what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
Acts,2,17,And it shall come to pass in the last days God declares that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all mankind and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy [ telling forth the divine counsels] and your young men shall see visions ( divinely granted appearances) and your old men shall dream [ divinely suggested] dreams.
Acts,2,18,Yes and on My menservants also and on My maidservants in those days I will pour out of My Spirit and they shall prophesy [ telling forth the divine counsels and predicting future events pertaining especially to God's kingdom].
Acts,2,19,And I will show wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath blood and fire and smoking vapor;
Acts,2,20,The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the obvious day of the Lord comes--that great and notable and conspicuous and renowned [day].
Acts,2,21,And it shall be that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord [ invoking adoring and worshiping the Lord--Christ] shall be saved.
Acts,2,22,You men of Israel listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth a Man accredited and pointed out and shown forth and commended and attested to you by God by the mighty works and [the power of performing] wonders and signs which God worked through Him [right] in your midst as you yourselves know--
Acts,2,23,This Jesus when delivered up according to the definite and fixed purpose and settled plan and foreknowledge of God you crucified and put out of the way [killing Him] by the hands of lawless and wicked men.
Acts,2,24,[But] God raised Him up liberating Him from the pangs of death seeing that it was not possible for Him to continue to be controlled or retained by it.
Acts,2,25,For David says in regard to Him I saw the Lord constantly before me for He is at my right hand that I may not be shaken or overthrown or cast down [from my secure and happy state].
Acts,2,26,Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted exceedingly; moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope [will encamp pitch its tent and dwell in hope in anticipation of the resurrection].
Acts,2,27,For You will not abandon my soul leaving it helpless in Hades (the state of departed spirits) nor let Your Holy One know decay or see destruction [of the body after death].
Acts,2,28,You have made known to me the ways of life; You will enrapture me [diffusing my soul with joy] with and in Your presence.
Acts,2,29,Brethren it is permitted me to tell you confidently and with freedom concerning the patriarch David that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day.
Acts,2,30,Being however a prophet and knowing that God had sealed to him with an oath that He would set one of his descendants on his throne [II Sam. 7:12-16; Ps. 132:11.]
Acts,2,31,He foreseeing this spoke [by foreknowledge] of the resurrection of the Christ (the Messiah) that He was not deserted [in death] and left in Hades (the state of departed spirits) nor did His body know decay or see destruction.
Acts,2,32,This Jesus God raised up and of that all we [His disciples] are witnesses.
Acts,2,33,Being therefore lifted high by and to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promised [blessing which is the] Holy Spirit He has made this outpouring which you yourselves both see and hear.
Acts,2,34,For David did not ascend into the heavens; yet he himself says The Lord said to my Lord Sit at My right hand and share My throne
Acts,2,35,Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
Acts,2,36,Therefore let the whole house of Israel recognize beyond all doubt and acknowledge assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ (the Messiah)--this Jesus Whom you crucified.
Acts,2,37,Now when they heard this they were stung (cut) to the heart and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles (special messengers) Brethren what shall we do?
Acts,2,38,And Peter answered them Repent (change your views and purpose to accept the will of God in your inner selves instead of rejecting it) and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of and release from your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts,2,39,For the promise [of the Holy Spirit] is to and for you and your children and to and for all that are far away [even] to and for as many as the Lord our God invites and bids to come to Himself.
Acts,2,40,And [Peter] solemnly and earnestly witnessed (testified) and admonished (exhorted) with much more continuous speaking and warned (reproved advised encouraged) them saying Be saved from this crooked (perverse wicked unjust) generation.
Acts,2,41,Therefore those who accepted and welcomed his message were baptized and there were added that day about 3000 souls.
Acts,2,42,And they steadfastly persevered devoting themselves constantly to the instruction and fellowship of the apostles to the breaking of bread [including the Lord's Supper] and prayers.
Acts,2,43,And a sense of awe (reverential fear) came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were performed through the apostles (the special messengers).
Acts,2,44,And all who believed (who adhered to and trusted in and relied on Jesus Christ) were united and [together] they had everything in common;
Acts,2,45,And they sold their possessions (both their landed property and their movable goods) and distributed the price among all according as any had need.
Acts,2,46,And day after day they regularly assembled in the temple with united purpose and in their homes they broke bread [including the Lord's Supper]. They partook of their food with gladness and simplicity and generous hearts
Acts,2,47,Constantly praising God and being in favor and goodwill with all the people; and the Lord kept adding [to their number] daily those who were being saved [from spiritual death].
Acts,3,1,NOW PETER and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer the ninth hour (three o'clock in the afternoon)
Acts,3,2,[When] a certain man crippled from his birth was being carried along who was laid each day at that gate of the temple [which is] called Beautiful so that he might beg for charitable gifts from those who entered the temple.
Acts,3,3,So when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple he asked them to give him a gift.
Acts,3,4,And Peter directed his gaze intently at him and so did John and said Look at us!
Acts,3,5,And [the man] paid attention to them expecting that he was going to get something from them.
Acts,3,6,But Peter said Silver and gold (money) I do not have; but what I do have that I give to you: in [the use of] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth walk!
Acts,3,7,Then he took hold of the man's right hand with a firm grip and raised him up. And at once his feet and ankle bones became strong and steady
Acts,3,8,And leaping forth he stood and began to walk and he went into the temple with them walking and leaping and praising God.
Acts,3,9,And all the people saw him walking about and praising God
Acts,3,10,And they recognized him as the man who usually sat [begging] for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement (bewilderment consternation) over what had occurred to him.
Acts,3,11,Now while he [still] firmly clung to Peter and John all the people in utmost amazement ran together and crowded around them in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's.
Acts,3,12,And Peter seeing it answered the people You men of Israel why are you so surprised and wondering at this? Why do you keep staring at us as though by our [own individual] power or [active] piety we had made this man [able] to walk?
Acts,3,13,The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the God of our forefathers has glorified His Servant and Son Jesus [doing Him this honor] Whom you indeed delivered up and denied and rejected and disowned in the presence of Pilate when he had determined to let Him go.
Acts,3,14,But you denied and rejected and disowned the Pure and Holy the Just and Blameless One and demanded [the pardon of] a murderer to be granted to you.
Acts,3,15,But you killed the very Source (the Author) of life Whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
Acts,3,16,And His name through and by faith in His name has made this man whom you see and recognize well and strong. [Yes] the faith which is through and by Him [Jesus] has given the man this perfect soundness [of body] before all of you.
Acts,3,17,And now brethren I know that you acted in ignorance [not aware of what you were doing] as did your rulers also.
Acts,3,18,Thus has God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets that His Christ (the Messiah) should undergo ill treatment and be afflicted and suffer.
Acts,3,19,So repent (change your mind and purpose); turn around and return [to God] that your sins may be erased (blotted out wiped clean) that times of refreshing (of recovering from the effects of heat of reviving with fresh air) may come from the presence of the Lord;
Acts,3,20,And that He may send [to you] the Christ (the Messiah) Who before was designated and appointed for you--even Jesus
Acts,3,21,Whom heaven must receive [and retain] until the time for the complete restoration of all that God spoke by the mouth of all His holy prophets for ages past [from the most ancient time in the memory of man].
Acts,3,22,Thus Moses said to the forefathers The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as [He raised up] me; Him you shall listen to and understand by hearing and heed in all things whatever He tells you.
Acts,3,23,And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to and understand by hearing and heed that Prophet shall be utterly exterminated from among the people.
Acts,3,24,Indeed all the prophets from Samuel and those who came afterwards as many as have spoken also promised and foretold and proclaimed these days.
Acts,3,25,You are the descendants (sons) of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant which God made and gave to your forefathers saying to Abraham And in your Seed (Heir) shall all the families of the earth be blessed and benefited.
Acts,3,26,It was to you first that God sent His Servant and Son Jesus when He raised Him up [ provided and gave Him for us] to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness and evil ways.
Acts,4,1,AND WHILE they [Peter and John] were talking to the people the high priests and the military commander of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them
Acts,4,2,Being vexed and indignant through and through because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in [the case of] Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts,4,3,So they laid hands on them (arrested them) and put them in prison until the following day for it was already evening.
Acts,4,4,But many of those who heard the message believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on Jesus as the Christ). And their number grew and came to about 5000.
Acts,4,5,Then on the following day their magistrates and elders and scribes were assembled in Jerusalem
Acts,4,6,Including Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all others who belonged to the high priestly relationship.
Acts,4,7,And they set the men in their midst and repeatedly demanded By what sort of power or by what kind of authority did [such people as] you do this [healing]?
Acts,4,8,Then Peter [because he was] filled with [and controlled by] the Holy Spirit said to them Rulers of the people and members of the council (the Sanhedrin)
Acts,4,9,If we are being put on trial [here] today and examined concerning a good deed done to benefit a feeble (helpless) cripple by what means this man has been restored to health
Acts,4,10,Let it be known and understood by all of you and by the whole house of Israel that in the name and through the power and authority of Jesus Christ of Nazareth Whom you crucified [but] Whom God raised from the dead in Him and by means of Him this man is standing here before you well and sound in body.
Acts,4,11,This [Jesus] is the Stone which was despised and rejected by you the builders but which has become the Head of the corner [the Cornerstone].
Acts,4,12,And there is salvation in and through no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among men by and in which we must be saved.
Acts,4,13,Now when they saw the boldness and unfettered eloquence of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and untrained in the schools [common men with no educational advantages] they marveled; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
Acts,4,14,And since they saw the man who had been cured standing there beside them they could not contradict the fact or say anything in opposition.
Acts,4,15,But having ordered [the prisoners] to go aside out of the council [chamber] they conferred (debated) among themselves
Acts,4,16,Saying What are we to do with these men? For that an extraordinary miracle has been performed by (through) them is plain to all the residents of Jerusalem and we cannot deny it.
Acts,4,17,But in order that it may not spread further among the people and the nation let us warn and forbid them with a stern threat to speak any more to anyone in this name [or about this Person].
Acts,4,18,[So] they summoned them and imperatively instructed them not to converse in any way or teach at all in or about the name of Jesus.
Acts,4,19,But Peter and John replied to them Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you and obey you rather than God you must decide (judge).
Acts,4,20,But we [ourselves] cannot help telling what we have seen and heard.
Acts,4,21,Then when [the rulers and council members] had further threatened them they let them go not seeing how they could secure a conviction against them because of the people; for everybody was praising and glorifying God for what had occurred.
Acts,4,22,For the man on whom this sign (miracle) of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
Acts,4,23,After they were permitted to go [the apostles] returned to their own [company] and told all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
Acts,4,24,And when they heard it lifted their voices together with one united mind to God and said O Sovereign Lord You are He Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that is in them
Acts,4,25,Who by the mouth of our forefather David Your servant and child said through the Holy Spirit Why did the heathen (Gentiles) become wanton and insolent and rage and the people imagine and study and plan vain (fruitless) things [that will not succeed]?
Acts,4,26,The kings of the earth took their stand in array [for attack] and the rulers were assembled and combined together against the Lord and against His Anointed (Christ the Messiah).
Acts,4,27,For in this city there actually met and plotted together against Your holy Child and Servant Jesus Whom You consecrated by anointing both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and peoples of Israel
Acts,4,28,To carry out all that Your hand and Your will and purpose had predestined (predetermined) should occur.
Acts,4,29,And now Lord observe their threats and grant to Your bond servants [full freedom] to declare Your message fearlessly
Acts,4,30,While You stretch out Your hand to cure and to perform signs and wonders through the authority and by the power of the name of Your holy Child and Servant Jesus.
Acts,4,31,And when they had prayed the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they continued to speak the Word of God with freedom and boldness and courage.
Acts,4,32,Now the company of believers was of one heart and soul and not one of them claimed that anything which he possessed was [exclusively] his own but everything they had was in common and for the use of all.
Acts,4,33,And with great strength and ability and power the apostles delivered their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace (loving-kindness and favor and goodwill) rested richly upon them all.
Acts,4,34,Nor was there a destitute or needy person among them for as many as were owners of lands or houses proceeded to sell them and one by one they brought (gave back) the amount received from the sales
Acts,4,35,And laid it at the feet of the apostles (special messengers). Then distribution was made according as anyone had need.
Acts,4,36,Now Joseph a Levite and native of Cyprus who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles which interpreted means Son of Encouragement
Acts,4,37,Sold a field which belonged to him and brought the sum of money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
Acts,5,1,BUT A certain man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property
Acts,5,2,And with his wife's knowledge and connivance he kept back and wrongfully appropriated some of the proceeds bringing only a part and putting it at the feet of the apostles.
Acts,5,3,But Peter said Ananias why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to and attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit and should [in violation of your promise] withdraw secretly and appropriate to your own use part of the price from the sale of the land?
Acts,5,4,As long as it remained unsold was it not still your own? And [even] after it was sold was not [the money] at your disposal and under your control? Why then is it that you have proposed and purposed in your heart to do this thing? [How could you have the heart to do such a deed?] You have not [simply] lied to men [playing false and showing yourself utterly deceitful] but to God.
Acts,5,5,Upon hearing these words Ananias fell down and died. And great dread and terror took possession of all who heard of it.
Acts,5,6,And the young men arose and wrapped up [the body] and carried it out and buried it.
Acts,5,7,Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not having learned of what had happened.
Acts,5,8,And Peter said to her Tell me did you sell the land for so much? Yes she said for so much.
Acts,5,9,Then Peter said to her How could you two have agreed and conspired together to try to deceive the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out [also].
Acts,5,10,And instantly she fell down at his feet and died; and the young men entering found her dead and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
Acts,5,11,And the whole church and all others who heard of these things were appalled [great awe and strange terror and dread seized them].
Acts,5,12,Now by the hands of the apostles (special messengers) numerous and startling signs and wonders were being performed among the people. And by common consent they all met together [at the temple] in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's.
Acts,5,13,And none of those who were not of their number dared to join and associate with them but the people held them in high regard and praised and made much of them.
Acts,5,14,More and more there were being added to the Lord those who believed [those who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him joined and gathered with them] crowds both of men and of women
Acts,5,15,So that they [even] kept carrying out the sick into the streets and placing them on couches and sleeping pads [in the hope] that as Peter passed by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
Acts,5,16,And the people gathered also from the towns and hamlets around Jerusalem bringing the sick and those troubled with foul spirits and they were all cured.
Acts,5,17,But the high priest rose up and all who were his supporters that is the party of the Sadducees and being filled with jealousy and indignation and rage
Acts,5,18,They seized and arrested the apostles (special messengers) and put them in the public jail.
Acts,5,19,But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and leading them out said
Acts,5,20,Go take your stand in the temple courts and declare to the people the whole doctrine concerning this Life (the eternal life which Christ revealed).
Acts,5,21,And when they heard this they accordingly went into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now the high priest and his supporters who were with him arrived and called together the council (Sanhedrin) even all the senate of the sons of Israel and they sent to the prison to have [the apostles] brought.
Acts,5,22,But when the attendants arrived there they failed to find them in the jail; so they came back and reported
Acts,5,23,We found the prison quite safely locked up and the guards were on duty outside the doors but when we opened [it] we found no one on the inside.
Acts,5,24,Now when the military leader of the temple area and the chief priests heard these facts they were much perplexed and thoroughly at a loss about them wondering into what this might grow.
Acts,5,25,But some man came and reported to them saying Listen! The men whom you put in jail are standing [right here] in the temple and teaching the people!
Acts,5,26,Then the military leader went with the attendants and brought [the prisoners] but without violence for they dreaded the people lest they be stoned by them.
Acts,5,27,So they brought them and set them before the council (Sanhedrin). And the high priest examined them by questioning
Acts,5,28,Saying We definitely commanded and strictly charged you not to teach in or about this Name; yet here you have flooded Jerusalem with your doctrine and you intend to bring this Man's blood upon us.
Acts,5,29,Then Peter and the apostles replied We must obey God rather than men.
Acts,5,30,The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus Whom you killed by hanging Him on a tree (cross).
Acts,5,31,God exalted Him to His right hand to be Prince and Leader and Savior and Deliverer and Preserver in order to grant repentance to Israel and to bestow forgiveness and release from sins.
Acts,5,32,And we are witnesses of these things and the Holy Spirit is also Whom God has bestowed on those who obey Him.
Acts,5,33,Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart and infuriated and wanted to kill the disciples.
Acts,5,34,But a certain Pharisee in the council (Sanhedrin) named Gamaliel a teacher of the Law highly esteemed by all the people standing up ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a little while.
Acts,5,35,Then he addressed them [the council saying]: Men of Israel take care in regard to what you propose to do concerning these men.
Acts,5,36,For before our time there arose Theudas asserting himself to be a person of importance with whom a number of men allied themselves about 400; but he was killed and all who had listened to and adhered to him were scattered and brought to nothing.
Acts,5,37,And after this one rose up Judas the Galilean [who led an uprising] during the time of the census and drew away a popular following after him; he also perished and all his adherents were scattered.
Acts,5,38,Now in the present case let me say to you stand off (withdraw) from these men and let them alone. For if this doctrine or purpose or undertaking or movement is of human origin it will fail (be overthrown and come to nothing);
Acts,5,39,But if it is of God you will not be able to stop or overthrow or destroy them; you might even be found fighting against God!
Acts,5,40,So convinced by him they took his advice; and summoning the apostles they flogged them and sternly forbade them to speak in or about the name of Jesus and allowed them to go.
Acts,5,41,So they went out from the presence of the council (Sanhedrin) rejoicing that they were being counted worthy [dignified by the indignity] to suffer shame and be exposed to disgrace for [the sake of] His name.
Acts,5,42,Yet [in spite of the threats] they never ceased for a single day both in the temple area and at home to teach and to proclaim the good news (Gospel) of Jesus [as] the Christ (the Messiah).
Acts,6,1,NOW ABOUT this time when the number of the disciples was greatly increasing complaint was made by the Hellenists (the Greek-speaking Jews) against the [native] Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked and neglected in the daily ministration (distribution of relief).
Acts,6,2,So the Twelve [apostles] convened the multitude of the disciples and said It is not seemly or desirable or right that we should have to give up or neglect [preaching] the Word of God in order to attend to serving at tables and superintending the distribution of food.
Acts,6,3,Therefore select out from among yourselves brethren seven men of good and attested character and repute full of the [Holy] Spirit and wisdom whom we may assign to look after this business and duty.
Acts,6,4,But we will continue to devote ourselves steadfastly to prayer and the ministry of the Word.
Acts,6,5,And the suggestion pleased the whole assembly and they selected Stephen a man full of faith (a strong and welcome belief that Jesus is the Messiah) and full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus a proselyte (convert) from Antioch.
Acts,6,6,These they presented to the apostles who after prayer laid their hands on them.
Acts,6,7,And the message of God kept on spreading and the number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and [besides] a large number of the priests were obedient to the faith [in Jesus as the Messiah through Whom is obtained eternal salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,6,8,Now Stephen full of grace (divine blessing and favor) and power (strength and ability) worked great wonders and signs (miracles) among the people.
Acts,6,9,However some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (freed Jewish slaves) as it was called and [of the synagogues] of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and [the province of] Asia arose [and undertook] to debate and dispute with Stephen.
Acts,6,10,But they were not able to resist the intelligence and the wisdom and [the inspiration of] the Spirit with which and by Whom he spoke.
Acts,6,11,So they [secretly] instigated and instructed men to say We have heard this man speak using slanderous and abusive and blasphemous language against Moses and God.
Acts,6,12,[Thus] they incited the people as well as the elders and the scribes and they came upon Stephen and arrested him and took him before the council (Sanhedrin).
Acts,6,13,And they brought forward false witnesses who asserted This man never stops making statements against this sacred place and the Law [of Moses];
Acts,6,14,For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear down and destroy this place and will alter the institutions and usages which Moses transmitted to us.
Acts,6,15,Then all who sat in the council (Sanhedrin) as they gazed intently at Stephen saw that his face had the appearance of the face of an angel.
Acts,7,1,AND THE high priest asked [Stephen] Are these charges true?
Acts,7,2,And he answered Brethren and fathers listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was still in Mesopotamia before he [went to] live in Haran
Acts,7,3,And He said to him Leave your own country and your relatives and come into the land (region) that I will point out to you.
Acts,7,4,So then he went forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there after his father died [God] transferred him to this country in which you are now dwelling.
Acts,7,5,Yet He gave him no inheritable property in it [no] not even enough ground to set his foot on; but He promised that He would give it to Him for a permanent possession and to his descendants after him even though [as yet] he had no child.
Acts,7,6,And this is [in effect] what God told him: That his descendants would be aliens (strangers) in a land belonging to other people who would bring them into bondage and ill-treat them 400 years.
Acts,7,7,But I will judge the nation to whom they will be slaves said God and after that they will escape and come forth and worship Me in this [very] place.
Acts,7,8,And [God] made with Abraham a covenant (an agreement to be religiously observed) of which circumcision was the seal. And under these circumstances [Abraham] became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac [did so] when he became the father of Jacob and Jacob [when each of his sons was born] the twelve patriarchs.
Acts,7,9,And the patriarchs [Jacob's sons] boiling with envy and hatred and anger sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him
Acts,7,10,And delivered him from all his distressing afflictions and won him goodwill and favor and wisdom and understanding in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt who made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Acts,7,11,Then there came a famine over all of Egypt and Canaan with great distress and our forefathers could find no fodder [for the cattle] or vegetable sustenance [for their households].
Acts,7,12,But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt he sent forth our forefathers [to go there on their] first trip.
Acts,7,13,And on their second visit Joseph revealed himself to his brothers and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh and his origin and race.
Acts,7,14,And Joseph sent an invitation calling to himself Jacob his father and all his kindred seventy-five persons in all.
Acts,7,15,And Jacob went down into Egypt where he himself died as did [also] our forefathers;
Acts,7,16,And their bodies [Jacob's and Joseph's] were taken back to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of [silver] money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts,7,17,But as the time for the fulfillment of the promise drew near which God had made to Abraham the [Hebrew] people increased and multiplied in Egypt
Acts,7,18,Until [the time when] there arose over Egypt another and a different king who did not know Joseph [neither knowing his history and services nor recognizing his merits].
Acts,7,19,He dealt treacherously with and defrauded our race; he abused and oppressed our forefathers forcing them to expose their babies so that they might not be kept alive.
Acts,7,20,At this juncture Moses was born and was exceedingly beautiful in God's sight. For three months he was nurtured in his father's house;
Acts,7,21,Then when he was exposed [to perish] the daughter of Pharaoh rescued him and took him and reared him as her own son.
Acts,7,22,So Moses was educated in all the wisdom and culture of the Egyptians and he was mighty (powerful) in his speech and deeds.
Acts,7,23,And when he was in his fortieth year it came into his heart to visit his kinsmen the children of Israel [ to help them and to care for them].
Acts,7,24,And on seeing one of them being unjustly treated he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian and slaying [him].
Acts,7,25,He expected his brethren to understand that God was granting them deliverance by his hand [taking it for granted that they would accept him]; but they did not understand.
Acts,7,26,Then on the next day he suddenly appeared to some who were quarreling and fighting among themselves and he urged them to make peace and become reconciled saying Men you are brethren; why do you abuse and wrong one another?
Acts,7,27,Whereupon the man who was abusing his neighbor pushed [Moses] aside saying Who appointed you a ruler (umpire) and a judge over us?
Acts,7,28,Do you intend to slay me as you slew the Egyptian yesterday?
Acts,7,29,At that reply Moses sought safety by flight and he was an exile and an alien in the country of Midian where he became the father of two sons.
Acts,7,30,And when forty years had gone by there appeared to him in the wilderness (desert) of Mount Sinai an angel in the flame of a burning bramblebush.
Acts,7,31,When Moses saw it he was astonished and marveled at the sight; but when he went close to investigate there came to him the voice of the Lord saying
Acts,7,32,I am the God of your forefathers the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And Moses trembled and was so terrified that he did not venture to look.
Acts,7,33,Then the Lord said to him Remove the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground and worthy of veneration.
Acts,7,34,Because I have most assuredly seen the abuse and oppression of My people in Egypt and have heard their sighing and groaning I have come down to rescue them. So now come! I will send you back to Egypt [as My messenger].
Acts,7,35,It was this very Moses whom they had denied (disowned and rejected) saying Who made you our ruler (referee) and judge? whom God sent to be a ruler and deliverer and redeemer by and with the [protecting and helping] hand of the Angel that appeared to him in the bramblebush.
Acts,7,36,He it was who led them forth having worked wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and during the forty years in the wilderness (desert).
Acts,7,37,It was this [very] Moses who said to the children of Israel God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as He raised me up.
Acts,7,38,This is he who in the assembly in the wilderness (desert) was the go-between for the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and our forefathers and he received living oracles (words that still live) to be handed down to us.
Acts,7,39,[And yet] our forefathers determined not to be subject to him [refusing to listen to or obey him]; but thrusting him aside they rejected him and in their hearts yearned for and turned back to Egypt.
Acts,7,40,And they said to Aaron Make us gods who shall [be our leaders and] go before us; as for this Moses who led us forth from the land of Egypt--we have no knowledge of what has happened to him.
Acts,7,41,And they [even] made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice to the idol and made merry and exulted in the work of their [own] hands.
Acts,7,42,But God turned [away from them] and delivered them up to worship and serve the host (stars) of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets: Did you [really] offer to Me slain beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness (desert) O house of Israel?
Acts,7,43,[No!] You took up the tent (the portable temple) of Moloch and carried it [with you] and the star of the god Rephan the images which you [yourselves] made that you might worship them; and I will remove you [carrying you away into exile] beyond Babylon.
Acts,7,44,Our forefathers had the tent (tabernacle) of witness in the wilderness even as He Who directed Moses to make it had ordered according to the pattern and model he had seen.
Acts,7,45,Our forefathers in turn brought it [this tent of witness] in [with them into the land] with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God drove out before the face of our forefathers. [So it remained here] until the time of David
Acts,7,46,Who found grace (favor and spiritual blessing) in the sight of God and prayed that he might be allowed to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. [II Sam. 7:8-16; Ps. 132:1-5.]
Acts,7,47,But it was Solomon who built a house for Him. [I Kings 6.]
Acts,7,48,However the Most High does not dwell in houses and temples made with hands; as the prophet says
Acts,7,49,Heaven [is] My throne and earth the footstool for My feet. What [kind of] house can you build for Me says the Lord or what is the place in which I can rest?
Acts,7,50,Was it not My hand that made all these things?
Acts,7,51,You stubborn and stiff-necked people still heathen and uncircumcised in heart and ears you are always actively resisting the Holy Spirit. As your forefathers [were] so you [are and so you do]!
Acts,7,52,Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? And they slew those who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Righteous One Whom you now have betrayed and murdered--
Acts,7,53,You who received the Law as it was ordained and set in order and delivered by angels and [yet] you did not obey it!
Acts,7,54,Now upon hearing these things they [the Jews] were cut to the heart and infuriated and they ground their teeth against [Stephen].
Acts,7,55,But he full of the Holy Spirit and controlled by Him gazed into heaven and saw the glory (the splendor and majesty) of God and Jesus standing at God's right hand;
Acts,7,56,And he said Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing at God's right hand!
Acts,7,57,But they raised a great shout and put their hands over their ears and rushed together upon him.
Acts,7,58,Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him and the witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts,7,59,And while they were stoning Stephen he prayed Lord Jesus receive and accept and welcome my spirit!
Acts,7,60,And falling on his knees he cried out loudly Lord fix not this sin upon them [lay it not to their charge]! And when he had said this he fell asleep [in death].
Acts,8,1,AND SAUL was [not only] consenting to [Stephen's] death [he was pleased and entirely approving]. On that day a great and severe persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles (special messengers).
Acts,8,2,[A party of] devout men with others helped to carry out and bury Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
Acts,8,3,But Saul shamefully treated and laid waste the church continuously [with cruelty and violence]; and entering house after house he dragged out men and women and committed them to prison.
Acts,8,4,Now those who were scattered abroad went about [through the land from place to place] preaching the glad tidings the Word [ the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,8,5,Philip [the deacon not the apostle] went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ (the Messiah) to them [the people];
Acts,8,6,And great crowds of people with one accord listened to and heeded what was said by Philip as they heard him and watched the miracles and wonders which he kept performing [from time to time].
Acts,8,7,For foul spirits came out of many who were possessed by them screaming and shouting with a loud voice and many who were suffering from palsy or were crippled were restored to health.
Acts,8,8,And there was great rejoicing in that city.
Acts,8,9,But there was a man named Simon who had formerly practiced magic arts in the city to the utter amazement of the Samaritan nation claiming that he himself was an extraordinary and distinguished person.
Acts,8,10,They all paid earnest attention to him from the least to the greatest saying This man is that exhibition of the power of God which is called great (intense).
Acts,8,11,And they were attentive and made much of him because for a long time he had amazed and bewildered and dazzled them with his skill in magic arts.
Acts,8,12,But when they believed the good news (the Gospel) about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) as Philip preached it they were baptized both men and women.
Acts,8,13,Even Simon himself believed [he adhered to trusted in and relied on the teaching of Philip] and after being baptized devoted himself constantly to him. And seeing signs and miracles of great power which were being performed he was utterly amazed.
Acts,8,14,Now when the apostles (special messengers) at Jerusalem heard that [the country of] Samaria had accepted and welcomed the Word of God they sent Peter and John to them
Acts,8,15,And they came down and prayed for them that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit;
Acts,8,16,For He had not yet fallen upon any of them but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts,8,17,Then [the apostles] laid their hands on them one by one and they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts,8,18,However when Simon saw that the [Holy] Spirit was imparted through the laying on of the apostles' hands he brought money and offered it to them
Acts,8,19,Saying Grant me also this power and authority in order that anyone on whom I place my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.
Acts,8,20,But Peter said to him Destruction overtake your money and you because you imagined you could obtain the [free] gift of God with money!
Acts,8,21,You have neither part nor lot in this matter for your heart is all wrong in God's sight [it is not straightforward or right or true before God].
Acts,8,22,So repent of this depravity and wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that if possible this contriving thought and purpose of your heart may be removed and disregarded and forgiven you.
Acts,8,23,For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in a bond forged by iniquity [to fetter souls].
Acts,8,24,And Simon answered Pray for me [beseech the Lord both of you] that nothing of what you have said may befall me!
Acts,8,25,Now when [the apostles] had borne their testimony and preached the message of the Lord they went back to Jerusalem proclaiming the glad tidings (Gospel) to many villages of the Samaritans [on the way].
Acts,8,26,But an angel of the Lord said to Philip Rise and proceed southward or at midday on the road that runs from Jerusalem down to Gaza. This is the desert [ route].
Acts,8,27,So he got up and went. And behold an Ethiopian a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians who was in charge of all her treasure had come to Jerusalem to worship.
Acts,8,28,And he was [now] returning and sitting in his chariot he was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.
Acts,8,29,Then the [Holy] Spirit said to Philip Go forward and join yourself to this chariot.
Acts,8,30,Accordingly Philip running up to him heard [the man] reading the prophet Isaiah and asked Do you really understand what you are reading?
Acts,8,31,And he said How is it possible for me to do so unless someone explains it to me and guides me [in the right way]? And he earnestly requested Philip to come up and sit beside him.
Acts,8,32,Now this was the passage of Scripture which he was reading: Like a sheep He was led to the slaughter and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb so He opens not His mouth.
Acts,8,33,In His humiliation He was taken away by distressing and oppressive judgment and justice was denied Him [caused to cease]. Who can describe or relate in full the wickedness of His contemporaries (generation)? For His life is taken from the earth and a bloody death inflicted upon Him.
Acts,8,34,And the eunuch said to Philip I beg of you tell me about whom does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else?
Acts,8,35,Then Philip opened his mouth and beginning with this portion of Scripture he announced to him the glad tidings (Gospel) of Jesus and about Him.
Acts,8,36,And as they continued along on the way they came to some water and the eunuch exclaimed See [here is] water! What is to hinder my being baptized?
Acts,8,37,And Philip said If you believe with all your heart [if you have a conviction full of joyful trust that Jesus is the Messiah and accept Him as the Author of your salvation in the kingdom of God giving Him your obedience then] you may. And he replied I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
Acts,8,38,And he ordered that the chariot be stopped; and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and [Philip] baptized him.
Acts,8,39,And when they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord [ suddenly] caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing.
Acts,8,40,But Philip was found at Azotus and passing on he preached the good news (Gospel) to all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
Acts,9,1,MEANWHILE SAUL still drawing his breath hard from threatening and murderous desire against the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest
Acts,9,2,And requested of him letters to the synagogues at Damascus [authorizing him] so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way [of life as determined by faith in Jesus Christ] he might bring them bound [with chains] to Jerusalem.
Acts,9,3,Now as he traveled on he came near to Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
Acts,9,4,And he fell to the ground. Then he heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why are you persecuting Me [harassing troubling and molesting Me]?
Acts,9,5,And Saul said Who are You Lord? And He said I am Jesus Whom you are persecuting. It is dangerous and it will turn out badly for you to keep kicking against the goad [to offer vain and perilous resistance].
Acts,9,6,Trembling and astonished he asked Lord what do You desire me to do? The Lord said to him But arise and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.
Acts,9,7,The men who were accompanying him were unable to speak [for terror] hearing the voice but seeing no one.
Acts,9,8,Then Saul got up from the ground but though his eyes were opened he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
Acts,9,9,And he was unable to see for three days and he neither ate nor drank [anything].
Acts,9,10,Now there was in Damascus a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision Ananias. And he answered Here am I Lord.
Acts,9,11,And the Lord said to him Get up and go to the street called Straight and ask at the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul for behold he is praying [there].
Acts,9,12,And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias enter and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.
Acts,9,13,But Ananias answered Lord I have heard many people tell about this man especially how much evil and what great suffering he has brought on Your saints at Jerusalem;
Acts,9,14,Now he is here and has authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call upon Your name.
Acts,9,15,But the Lord said to him Go for this man is a chosen instrument of Mine to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the descendants of Israel;
Acts,9,16,For I will make clear to him how much he will be afflicted and must endure and suffer for My name's sake.
Acts,9,17,So Ananias left and went into the house. And he laid his hands on Saul and said Brother Saul the Lord Jesus Who appeared to you along the way by which you came here has sent me that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Acts,9,18,And instantly something like scales fell from [Saul's] eyes and he recovered his sight. Then he arose and was baptized
Acts,9,19,And after he took some food he was strengthened. For several days [afterward] he remained with the disciples at Damascus.
Acts,9,20,And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus saying He is the Son of God!
Acts,9,21,And all who heard him were amazed and said Is not this the very man who harassed and overthrew and destroyed in Jerusalem those who called upon this Name? And he has come here for the express purpose of arresting them and bringing them in chains before the chief priests.
Acts,9,22,But Saul increased all the more in strength and continued to confound and put to confusion the Jews who lived in Damascus by comparing and examining evidence and proving that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah).
Acts,9,23,After considerable time had elapsed the Jews conspired to put Saul out of the way by slaying him
Acts,9,24,But [the knowledge of] their plot was made known to Saul. They were guarding the [city's] gates day and night to kill him
Acts,9,25,But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the [city's] wall lowering him in a basket or hamper.
Acts,9,26,And when he had arrived in Jerusalem he tried to associate himself with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him for they did not believe he really was a disciple.
Acts,9,27,However Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and he explained to them how along the way he had seen the Lord Who spoke to him and how at Damascus he had preached freely and confidently and courageously in the name of Jesus.
Acts,9,28,So he went in and out [as one] among them at Jerusalem
Acts,9,29,Preaching freely and confidently and boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and discussed with and disputed against the Hellenists (the Grecian Jews) but they were seeking to slay him.
Acts,9,30,And when the brethren found it out they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus [his home town].
Acts,9,31,So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was edified [growing in wisdom virtue and piety] and walking in the respect and reverential fear of the Lord and in the consolation and exhortation of the Holy Spirit continued to increase and was multiplied.
Acts,9,32,Now as Peter went here and there among them all he went down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
Acts,9,33,There he found a man named Aeneas who had been bedfast for eight years and was paralyzed.
Acts,9,34,And Peter said to him Aeneas Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [now] makes you whole. Get up and make your bed! And immediately [Aeneas] stood up.
Acts,9,35,Then all the inhabitants of Lydda and the plain of Sharon saw [what had happened to] him and they turned to the Lord.
Acts,9,36,Now there was at Joppa a disciple [a woman] named [in Aramaic] Tabitha which [in Greek] means Dorcas. She was abounding in good deeds and acts of charity.
Acts,9,37,About that time she fell sick and died and when they had cleansed her they laid [her] in an upper room.
Acts,9,38,Since Lydda was near Joppa [however] the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him begging him Do come to us without delay.
Acts,9,39,So Peter [immediately] rose and accompanied them. And when he had arrived they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood around him crying and displaying undershirts (tunics) and [other] garments such as Dorcas was accustomed to make while she was with them.
Acts,9,40,But Peter put them all out [of the room] and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said Tabitha get up! And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter she raised herself and sat upright.
Acts,9,41,And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling in God's people and the widows he presented her to them alive.
Acts,9,42,And this became known throughout all Joppa and many came to believe on the Lord [to adhere to and trust in and rely on Him as the Christ and as their Savior].
Acts,9,43,And Peter remained in Joppa for considerable time with a certain Simon a tanner.
Acts,10,1,NOW [living] at Caesarea there was a man whose name was Cornelius a centurion (captain) of what was known as the Italian Regiment
Acts,10,2,A devout man who venerated God and treated Him with reverential obedience as did all his household; and he gave much alms to the people and prayed continually to God.
Acts,10,3,About the ninth hour (about 3:00 p.m.) of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God entering and saying to him Cornelius!
Acts,10,4,And he gazing intently at him became frightened and said What is it Lord? And the angel said to him Your prayers and your [generous] gifts to the poor have come up [as a sacrifice] to God and have been remembered by Him.
Acts,10,5,And now send men to Joppa and have them call for and invite here a certain Simon whose surname is Peter;
Acts,10,6,He is lodging with Simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside.
Acts,10,7,When the angel who spoke to him had left Cornelius called two of his servants and a God-fearing soldier from among his own personal attendants.
Acts,10,8,And having rehearsed everything to them he sent them to Joppa.
Acts,10,9,The next day as they were still on their way and were approaching the town Peter went up to the roof of the house to pray about the sixth hour (noon).
Acts,10,10,But he became very hungry and wanted something to eat; and while the meal was being prepared a trance came over him
Acts,10,11,And he saw the sky opened and something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners descending to the earth.
Acts,10,12,It contained all kinds of quadrupeds and wild beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the air.
Acts,10,13,And there came a voice to him saying Rise up Peter kill and eat.
Acts,10,14,But Peter said No by no means Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unhallowed or [ceremonially] unclean.
Acts,10,15,And the voice came to him again a second time What God has cleansed and pronounced clean do not you defile and profane by regarding and calling common and unhallowed or unclean.
Acts,10,16,This occurred three times; then immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven.
Acts,10,17,Now Peter was still inwardly perplexed and doubted as to what the vision which he had seen could mean when [just then] behold the messengers that were sent by Cornelius who had made inquiry for Simon's house stopped and stood before the gate.
Acts,10,18,And they called out to inquire whether Simon who was surnamed Peter was staying there.
Acts,10,19,And while Peter was earnestly revolving the vision in his mind and meditating on it the [Holy] Spirit said to him Behold three men are looking for you!
Acts,10,20,Get up and go below and accompany them without any doubt [about its legality] or any discrimination or hesitation for I have sent them.
Acts,10,21,Then Peter went down to the men and said I am the man you seek; what is the purpose of your coming?
Acts,10,22,And they said Cornelius a centurion (captain) who is just and upright and in right standing with God being God-fearing and obedient and well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house; and he has received in answer [to prayer] a warning to listen to and act upon what you have to say.
Acts,10,23,So Peter invited them in to be his guests [for the night]. The next day he arose and went away with them and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts,10,24,And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for and expecting them and he had invited together his relatives and his intimate friends.
Acts,10,25,As Peter arrived Cornelius met him and falling down at his feet he made obeisance and paid worshipful reverence to him.
Acts,10,26,But Peter raised him up saying Get up; I myself am also a man.
Acts,10,27,And as [Peter] spoke with him he entered the house and found a large group of persons assembled;
Acts,10,28,And he said to them You yourselves are aware how it is not lawful or permissible for a Jew to keep company with or to visit or [even] to come near or to speak first to anyone of another nationality but God has shown and taught me by words that I should not call any human being common or unhallowed or [ceremonially] unclean.
Acts,10,29,Therefore when I was sent for I came without hesitation or objection or misgivings. So now I ask for what reason you sent for me.
Acts,10,30,And Cornelius said This is now the fourth day since about this time I was observing the ninth hour (three o'clock in the afternoon) of prayer in my lodging place; [suddenly] a man stood before me in dazzling apparel
Acts,10,31,And he said Cornelius your prayer has been heard and harkened to and your donations to the poor have been known and preserved before God [so that He heeds and is about to help you].
Acts,10,32,Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is surnamed Peter; he is staying in the house of Simon the tanner by the seaside.
Acts,10,33,So at once I sent for you and you [being a Jew] have done a kind and courteous and handsome thing in coming. Now then we are all present in the sight of God to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.
Acts,10,34,And Peter opened his mouth and said: Most certainly and thoroughly I now perceive and understand that God shows no partiality and is no respecter of persons
Acts,10,35,But in every nation he who venerates and has a reverential fear for God treating Him with worshipful obedience and living uprightly is acceptable to Him and sure of being received and welcomed [by Him].
Acts,10,36,You know the contents of the message which He sent to Israel announcing the good news (Gospel) of peace by Jesus Christ Who is Lord of all--
Acts,10,37,The [same] message which was proclaimed throughout all Judea starting from Galilee after the baptism preached by John--
Acts,10,38,How God anointed and consecrated Jesus of Nazareth with the [Holy] Spirit and with strength and ability and power; how He went about doing good and in particular curing all who were harassed and oppressed by [the power of] the devil for God was with Him.
Acts,10,39,And we are [eye and ear] witnesses of everything that He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And [yet] they put Him out of the way (murdered Him) by hanging Him on a tree;
Acts,10,40,But God raised Him to life on the third day and caused Him to be manifest (to be plainly seen)
Acts,10,41,Not by all the people but to us who were chosen (designated) beforehand by God as witnesses who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
Acts,10,42,And He charged us to preach to the people and to bear solemn testimony that He is the God-appointed and God-ordained Judge of the living and the dead.
Acts,10,43,To Him all the prophets testify (bear witness) that everyone who believes in Him [who adheres to trusts in and relies on Him giving himself up to Him] receives forgiveness of sins through His name.
Acts,10,44,While Peter was still speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.
Acts,10,45,And the believers from among the circumcised [the Jews] who came with Peter were surprised and amazed because the free gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed and poured out largely even on the Gentiles.
Acts,10,46,For they heard them talking in [unknown] tongues (languages) and extolling and magnifying God. Then Peter asked
Acts,10,47,Can anyone forbid or refuse water for baptizing these people seeing that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?
Acts,10,48,And he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (the Messiah). Then they begged him to stay on there for some days.
Acts,11,1,NOW THE apostles (special messengers) and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard [with astonishment] that the Gentiles (heathen) also had received and accepted and welcomed the Word of God [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,11,2,So when Peter went up to Jerusalem the circumcision party [certain Jewish Christians] found fault with him [separating themselves from him in a hostile spirit opposing and disputing and contending with him]
Acts,11,3,Saying Why did you go to uncircumcised men and [even] eat with them?
Acts,11,4,But Peter began [at the beginning] and narrated and explained to them step by step [the whole list of events]. He said:
Acts,11,5,I was in the town of Joppa praying and [falling] in a trance I saw a vision of something coming down from heaven like a huge sheet lowered by the four corners; and it descended until it came to me.
Acts,11,6,Gazing intently and closely at it I observed in it [a variety of] four-footed animals and wild beasts and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air
Acts,11,7,And I heard a voice saying to me Get up Peter; kill and eat.
Acts,11,8,But I said No by no means Lord; for nothing common or unhallowed or [ceremonially] unclean has ever entered my mouth.
Acts,11,9,But the voice answered a second time from heaven What God has cleansed and pronounced clean do not you defile and profane by regarding or calling it common or unhallowed or unclean.
Acts,11,10,This occurred three times and then all was drawn up again into heaven.
Acts,11,11,And right then the three men sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house in which we were.
Acts,11,12,And the [Holy] Spirit instructed me to accompany them without [the least] hesitation or misgivings or discrimination. So these six brethren accompanied me also and we went into the man's house.
Acts,11,13,And he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house which stood and said to him Send men to Joppa and bring Simon who is surnamed Peter;
Acts,11,14,He will give and explain to you a message by means of which you and all your household [as well] will be saved [ from eternal death].
Acts,11,15,When I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell on them just as He did on us at the beginning.
Acts,11,16,Then I recalled the declaration of the Lord how He said John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with ( be placed in introduced into) the Holy Spirit.
Acts,11,17,If then God gave to them the same Gift [equally] as He gave to us when we believed in (adhered to trusted in and relied on) the Lord Jesus Christ who was I and what power or authority had I to interfere or hinder or forbid or withstand God?
Acts,11,18,When they heard this they were quieted and made no further objection. And they glorified God saying Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto [real] life [after resurrection].
Acts,11,19,Meanwhile those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen had traveled as far away as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch without delivering the message [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] to anyone except Jews.
Acts,11,20,But there were some of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene who on returning to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also proclaiming [to them] the good news (the Gospel) about the Lord Jesus.
Acts,11,21,And the presence of the Lord was with them with power so that a great number [learned] to believe (to adhere to and trust in and rely on the Lord) and turned and surrendered themselves to Him.
Acts,11,22,The rumors of this came to the ears of the church (assembly) in Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
Acts,11,23,When he arrived and saw what grace (favor) God was bestowing upon them he was full of joy; and he continuously exhorted (warned urged and encouraged) them all to cleave unto and remain faithful to and devoted to the Lord with [resolute and steady] purpose of heart.
Acts,11,24,For he was a good man [ good in himself and also at once for the good and the advantage of other people] full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit and full of faith (of his belief that Jesus is the Messiah through Whom we obtain eternal salvation). And a large company was added to the Lord.
Acts,11,25,[Barnabas] went on to Tarsus to hunt for Saul.
Acts,11,26,And when he had found him he brought him back to Antioch. For a whole year they assembled together with and were guests of the church and instructed a large number of people; and in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.
Acts,11,27,And during these days prophets (inspired teachers and interpreters of the divine will and purpose) came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts,11,28,And one of them named Agabus stood up and prophesied through the [Holy] Spirit that a great and severe famine would come upon the whole world. And this did occur during the reign of Claudius.
Acts,11,29,So the disciples resolved to send relief each according to his individual ability [in proportion as he had prospered] to the brethren who lived in Judea.
Acts,11,30,And so they did sending [their contributions] to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
Acts,12,1,ABOUT THAT time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict and oppress and torment some who belonged to the church (assembly).
Acts,12,2,And he killed James the brother of John with a sword;
Acts,12,3,And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews he proceeded further and arrested Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week].
Acts,12,4,And when he had seized [Peter] he put him in prison and delivered him to four squads of soldiers of four each to guard him purposing after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
Acts,12,5,So Peter was kept in prison but fervent prayer for him was persistently made to God by the church (assembly).
Acts,12,6,The very night before Herod was about to bring him forth Peter was sleeping between two soldiers fastened with two chains and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.
Acts,12,7,And suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared [standing beside him] and a light shone in the place where he was. And the angel gently smote Peter on the side and awakened him saying Get up quickly! And the chains fell off his hands.
Acts,12,8,And the angel said to him Tighten your belt and bind on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him Wrap your outer garment around you and follow me.
Acts,12,9,And [Peter] went out [along] following him and he was not conscious that what was apparently being done by the angel was real but thought he was seeing a vision.
Acts,12,10,When they had passed through the first guard and the second they came to the iron gate which leads into the city. Of its own accord [the gate] swung open and they went out and passed on through one street; and at once the angel left him.
Acts,12,11,Then Peter came to himself and said Now I really know and am sure that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting [to do to me].
Acts,12,12,When he at a glance became aware of this [ comprehending all the elements of the case] he went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark where a large number were assembled together and were praying.
Acts,12,13,And when he knocked at the gate of the porch a maid named Rhoda came to answer.
Acts,12,14,And recognizing Peter's voice in her joy she failed to open the gate but ran in and told the people that Peter was standing before the porch gate.
Acts,12,15,They said to her You are crazy! But she persistently and strongly and confidently affirmed that it was the truth. They said It is his angel!
Acts,12,16,But meanwhile Peter continued knocking and when they opened the gate and saw him they were amazed.
Acts,12,17,But motioning to them with his hand to keep quiet and listen he related to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison. And he said Report all this to James [the Less] and to the brethren. Then he left and went to some other place.
Acts,12,18,Now as soon as it was day there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
Acts,12,19,And when Herod had looked for him and could not find him he placed the guards on trial and commanded that they should be led away [to execution]. Then [Herod] went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed on there.
Acts,12,20,Now [Herod] cherished bitter animosity and hostility for the people of Tyre and Sidon; and [their deputies] came to him in a united body and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend they asked for peace because their country was nourished by and depended on the king's [country] for food.
Acts,12,21,On an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in his royal robes took his seat upon [his] throne and addressed an oration to them.
Acts,12,22,And the assembled people shouted It is the voice of a god and not of a man!
Acts,12,23,And at once an angel of the Lord smote him and cut him down because he did not give God the glory (the preeminence and kingly majesty that belong to Him as the supreme Ruler); and he was eaten by worms and died.
Acts,12,24,But the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] continued to grow and spread.
Acts,12,25,And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission bringing with them John whose surname was Mark.
Acts,13,1,NOW IN the church (assembly) at Antioch there were prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God) and teachers: Barnabas Symeon who was called Niger [Black] Lucius of Cyrene Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch and Saul.
Acts,13,2,While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting the Holy Spirit said Separate now for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
Acts,13,3,Then after fasting and praying they put their hands on them and sent them away.
Acts,13,4,So then being sent out by the Holy Spirit they went down to Seleucia and from [that port] they sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts,13,5,When they arrived at Salamis they preached the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John [Mark] as an attendant to assist them.
Acts,13,6,When they had passed through the entire island of Cyprus as far as Paphos they came upon a certain Jewish wizard or sorcerer a false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
Acts,13,7,He was closely associated with the proconsul Sergius Paulus who was an intelligent and sensible man of sound understanding; he summoned to him Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God [concerning salvation in the kingdom of God attained through Christ].
Acts,13,8,But Elymas the wise man--for that is the translation of his name [ which he had given himself]--opposed them seeking to keep the proconsul from accepting the faith.
Acts,13,9,But Saul who is also called Paul filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit looked steadily at [Elymas]
Acts,13,10,And said You master in every form of deception and recklessness unscrupulousness and wickedness you son of the devil you enemy of everything that is upright and good will you never stop perverting and making crooked the straight paths of the Lord and plotting against His saving purposes?
Acts,13,11,And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind [so blind that you will be] unable to see the sun for a time. Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness and he groped about seeking persons who would lead him by the hand.
Acts,13,12,Then the proconsul believed (became a Christian) when he saw what had occurred for he was astonished and deeply touched at the teaching concerning the Lord and from Him.
Acts,13,13,Now Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John [Mark] separated himself from them and went back to Jerusalem
Acts,13,14,But they [themselves] came on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue there and sat down.
Acts,13,15,After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the leaders [of the worship] of the synagogue sent to them saying Brethren if you have any word of exhortation or consolation or encouragement for the people say it.
Acts,13,16,So Paul arose and motioning with his hand said Men of Israel and you who reverence and fear God listen!
Acts,13,17,The God of this people Israel selected our forefathers and made this people great and important during their stay in the land of Egypt and then with an uplifted arm He led them out from there.
Acts,13,18,And for about forty years like a fatherly nurse He cared for them in the wilderness and endured their behavior.
Acts,13,19,When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan He gave them [the Hebrews] their land as an inheritance [distributing it to them by lot; all of which took] about 450 years.
Acts,13,20,After that He gave them judges until the prophet Samuel.
Acts,13,21,Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin for forty years.
Acts,13,22,And when He had deposed him He raised up David to be their king; of him He bore witness and said I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart who will do all My will and carry out My program fully. [I Sam. 13:14; Ps. 89:20; Isa. 44:28.]
Acts,13,23,Of this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior [in the person of Jesus] according to His promise.
Acts,13,24,Before His coming John had [already] preached baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts,13,25,And as John was ending his course he asked What or who do you secretly think that I am? I am not He [the Christ. No] but note that after me One is coming the sandals of Whose feet I am not worthy to untie!
Acts,13,26,Brethren sons of the family of Abraham and all those others among you who reverence and fear God to us has been sent the message of this salvation [the salvation obtained through Jesus Christ].
Acts,13,27,For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers because they did not know or recognize Him or understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath have actually fulfilled these very predictions by condemning and sentencing [Him].
Acts,13,28,And although they could find no cause deserving death with which to charge Him yet they asked Pilate to have Him executed and put out of the way.
Acts,13,29,And when they had finished and fulfilled everything that was written about Him they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
Acts,13,30,But God raised Him from the dead.
Acts,13,31,And for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem and they are His witnesses to the people.
Acts,13,32,So now we are bringing you the good news (Gospel) that what God promised to our forefathers
Acts,13,33,This He has completely fulfilled for us their children by raising up Jesus as it is written in the second psalm You are My Son; today I have begotten You [ caused You to arise to be born; formally shown You to be the Messiah by the resurrection].
Acts,13,34,And as to His having raised Him from among the dead now no more to return to [undergo] putrefaction and dissolution [of the grave] He spoke in this way I will fulfill and give to you the holy and sure mercy and blessings [that were promised and assured] to David.
Acts,13,35,For this reason He says also in another psalm You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption [to undergo putrefaction and dissolution of the grave].
Acts,13,36,For David after he had served God's will and purpose and counsel in his own generation fell asleep [ in death] and was buried among his forefathers and he did see corruption and undergo putrefaction and dissolution [of the grave].
Acts,13,37,But He Whom God raised up [to life] saw no corruption [did not experience putrefaction and dissolution of the grave].
Acts,13,38,So let it be clearly known and understood by you brethren that through this Man forgiveness and removal of sins is now proclaimed to you;
Acts,13,39,And that through Him everyone who believes [who acknowledges Jesus as his Savior and devotes himself to Him] is absolved (cleared and freed) from every charge from which he could not be justified and freed by the Law of Moses and given right standing with God.
Acts,13,40,Take care therefore lest there come upon you what is spoken in the prophets:
Acts,13,41,Look you scoffers and scorners and marvel and perish and vanish away; for I am doing a deed in your days a deed which you will never have confidence in or believe [even] if someone [ clearly describing it in detail] declares it to you.
Acts,13,42,As they [Paul and Barnabas] went out [of the synagogue] the people earnestly begged that these things might be told to them [further] the next Sabbath.
Acts,13,43,And when the congregation of the synagogue dispersed many of the Jews and the devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas who talked to them and urged them to continue [to trust themselves to and to stand fast] in the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God.
Acts,13,44,The next Sabbath almost the entire city gathered together to hear the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,13,45,But when the Jews saw the crowds filled with envy and jealousy they contradicted what was said by Paul and talked abusively [reviling and slandering him].
Acts,13,46,And Paul and Barnabas spoke out plainly and boldly saying It was necessary that God's message [concerning salvation through Christ] should be spoken to you first. But since you thrust it from you you pass this judgment on yourselves that you are unworthy of eternal life and out of your own mouth you will be judged. [Now] behold we turn to the Gentiles (the heathen).
Acts,13,47,For so the Lord has charged us saying I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles (the heathen) that you may bring [eternal] salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.
Acts,13,48,And when the Gentiles heard this they rejoiced and glorified (praised and gave thanks for) the Word of God; and as many as were destined (appointed and ordained) to eternal life believed (adhered to trusted in and relied on Jesus as the Christ and their Savior).
Acts,13,49,And so the Word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through Christ] scattered and spread throughout the whole region.
Acts,13,50,But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high rank and the outstanding men of the town and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their boundaries.
Acts,13,51,But [the apostles] shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.
Acts,13,52,And the disciples were continually filled [throughout their souls] with joy and the Holy Spirit.
Acts,14,1,NOW AT Iconium [also Paul and Barnabas] went into the Jewish synagogue together and spoke with such power that a great number both of Jews and of Greeks believed (became Christians);
Acts,14,2,But the unbelieving Jews [who rejected their message] aroused the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brethren.
Acts,14,3,So [Paul and Barnabas] stayed on there for a long time speaking freely and fearlessly and boldly in the Lord Who continued to bear testimony to the Word of His grace granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.
Acts,14,4,But the residents of the town were divided some siding with the Jews and some with the apostles.
Acts,14,5,When there was an attempt both on the part of the Gentiles and the Jews together with their rulers to insult and abuse and molest [Paul and Barnabas] and to stone them
Acts,14,6,They aware of the situation made their escape to Lystra and Derbe cities of Lycaonia and the neighboring districts;
Acts,14,7,And there they continued to preach the glad tidings (Gospel).
Acts,14,8,Now at Lystra a man sat who found it impossible to use his feet for he was a cripple from birth and had never walked.
Acts,14,9,He was listening to Paul as he talked and [Paul] gazing intently at him and observing that he had faith to be healed
Acts,14,10,Shouted at him saying Stand erect on your feet! And he leaped up and walked.
Acts,14,11,And the crowds when they saw what Paul had done lifted up their voices shouting in the Lycaonian language The gods have come down to us in human form!
Acts,14,12,They called Barnabas Zeus and they called Paul because he led in the discourse Hermes [god of speech].
Acts,14,13,And the priest of Zeus whose [temple] was at the entrance of the town brought bulls and garlands to the [city's] gates and wanted to join the people in offering sacrifice.
Acts,14,14,But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it they tore their clothing and dashed out among the crowd shouting
Acts,14,15,Men why are you doing this? We also are [only] human beings of nature like your own and we bring you the good news (Gospel) that you should turn away from these foolish and vain things to the living God Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that they contain.
Acts,14,16,In generations past He permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;
Acts,14,17,Yet He did not neglect to leave some witness of Himself for He did you good and [showed you] kindness and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons satisfying your hearts with nourishment and happiness.
Acts,14,18,Even in [the light of] these words they with difficulty prevented the people from offering sacrifice to them.
Acts,14,19,But some Jews arrived there from Antioch and Iconium; and having persuaded the people and won them over they stoned Paul and [ afterward] dragged him out of the town thinking that he was dead.
Acts,14,20,But the disciples formed a circle about him and he got up and went back into the town; and on the morrow he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts,14,21,When they had preached the good news (Gospel) to that town and made disciples of many of the people they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch
Acts,14,22,Establishing and strengthening the souls and the hearts of the disciples urging and warning and encouraging them to stand firm in the faith and [telling them] that it is through many hardships and tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
Acts,14,23,And when they had appointed and ordained elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in Whom they had come to believe [being full of joyful trust that He is the Christ the Messiah].
Acts,14,24,Then they went through Pisidia and arrived at Pamphylia.
Acts,14,25,And when they had spoken the Word in Perga [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] they went down to Attalia;
Acts,14,26,And from there they sailed back to Antioch where they had [first] been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had [now] completed.
Acts,14,27,Arriving there they gathered the church together and declared all that God had accomplished with them and how He had opened to the Gentiles a door of faith [in Jesus as the Messiah through Whom we obtain salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,14,28,And there they stayed no little time with the disciples.
Acts,15,1,BUT SOME men came down from Judea and were instructing the brethren Unless you are circumcised in accordance with the Mosaic custom you cannot be saved.
Acts,15,2,And when Paul and Barnabas had no small disagreement and discussion with them it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the others of their number should go up to Jerusalem [and confer] with the apostles (special messengers) and the elders about this matter.
Acts,15,3,So being fitted out and sent on their way by the church they went through both Phoenicia and Samaria telling of the conversion of the Gentiles (the heathen) and they caused great rejoicing among all the brethren.
Acts,15,4,When they arrived in Jerusalem they were heartily welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they told them all that God had accomplished through them.
Acts,15,5,But some who believed [who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him] belonged to the sect of the Pharisees and they rose up and said It is necessary to circumcise [the Gentile converts] and to charge them to obey the Law of Moses.
Acts,15,6,The apostles and the elders were assembled together to look into and consider this matter.
Acts,15,7,And after there had been a long debate Peter got up and said to them Brethren you know that quite a while ago God made a choice or selection from among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Gospel [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] and believe (credit and place their confidence in it).
Acts,15,8,And God Who is acquainted with and understands the heart bore witness to them giving them the Holy Spirit as He also did to us;
Acts,15,9,And He made no difference between us and them but cleansed their hearts by faith ( by a strong and welcome conviction that Jesus is the Messiah through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God).
Acts,15,10,Now then why do you try to test God by putting a yoke on the necks of the disciples such as neither our forefathers nor we [ourselves] were able to endure?
Acts,15,11,But we believe that we are saved through the grace (the undeserved favor and mercy) of the Lord Jesus just as they [are].
Acts,15,12,Then the whole assembly remained silent and they listened [attentively] as Barnabas and Paul rehearsed what signs and wonders God had performed through them among the Gentiles.
Acts,15,13,When they had finished talking James replied Brethren listen to me.
Acts,15,14,Simeon [Peter] has rehearsed how God first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people [to bear and honor] His name.
Acts,15,15,And with this the predictions of the prophets agree as it is written
Acts,15,16,After this I will come back and will rebuild the house of David which has fallen; I will rebuild its [very] ruins and I will set it up again
Acts,15,17,So that the rest of men may seek the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom My name has been invoked
Acts,15,18,Says the Lord Who has been making these things known from the beginning of the world.
Acts,15,19,Therefore it is my opinion that we should not put obstacles in the way of and annoy and disturb those of the Gentiles who turn to God
Acts,15,20,But we should send word to them in writing to abstain from and avoid anything that has been polluted by being offered to idols and all sexual impurity and [eating meat of animals] that have been strangled and [tasting of] blood.
Acts,15,21,For from ancient generations Moses has had his preachers in every town for he is read [aloud] every Sabbath in the synagogues.
Acts,15,22,Then the apostles and the elders together with the whole church resolved to select men from among their number and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas called Barsabbas and Silas [both] leading men among the brethren and sent them.
Acts,15,23,With [them they sent] the following letter: The brethren both the apostles and the elders to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia greetings:
Acts,15,24,As we have heard that some persons from our number have disturbed you with their teaching unsettling your minds and throwing you into confusion although we gave them no express orders or instructions [on the points in question]
Acts,15,25,It has been resolved by us in assembly to select men and send them [as messengers] to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul
Acts,15,26,Men who have hazarded their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts,15,27,So we have sent Judas and Silas who themselves will bring you the same message by word of mouth.
Acts,15,28,For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to lay upon you any greater burden than these indispensable requirements:
Acts,15,29,That you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from [tasting] blood and from [eating the meat of animals] that have been strangled and from sexual impurity. If you keep yourselves from these things you will do well. Farewell [be strong]!
Acts,15,30,So when [the messengers] were sent off they went down to Antioch; and having assembled the congregation they delivered the letter.
Acts,15,31,And when they read it the people rejoiced at the consolation and encouragement [it brought them].
Acts,15,32,And Judas and Silas who were themselves prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God) urged and warned and consoled and encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them.
Acts,15,33,And after spending some time there they were sent back by the brethren with [the greeting] peace to those who had sent them.
Acts,15,34,However Silas decided to stay on there.
Acts,15,35,But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch and with many others also continued teaching and proclaiming the good news the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in God's kingdom].
Acts,15,36,And after some time Paul said to Barnabas Come let us go back and again visit and help and minister to the brethren in every town where we made known the message of the Lord and see how they are getting along.
Acts,15,37,Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark [his near relative].
Acts,15,38,But Paul did not think it best to have along with them the one who had quit and deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work.
Acts,15,39,And there followed a sharp disagreement between them so that they separated from each other and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts,15,40,But Paul selected Silas and set out being commended by the brethren to the grace (the favor and mercy) of the Lord.
Acts,15,41,And he passed through Syria and Cilicia establishing and strengthening the churches.
Acts,16,1,AND [Paul] went down to Derbe and also to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer [she had become convinced that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of eternal salvation and yielded obedience to Him]; but [Timothy's] father was a Greek.
Acts,16,2,He [Timothy] had a good reputation among the brethren at Lystra and Iconium.
