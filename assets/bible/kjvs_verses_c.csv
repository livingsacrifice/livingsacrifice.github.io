2 Chronicles,11,4,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Ye shall not go up{H5927}{(H8799)}, nor fight{H3898}{(H8735)} against your brethren{H251}: return{H7725}{(H8798)} every man{H376} to his house{H1004}: for this thing{H1697} is done{H1961}{(H8738)} of me. And they obeyed{H8085}{(H8799)} the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} from going{H3212}{(H8800)} against Jeroboam{H3379}."

2 Chronicles,12,12,"And when he humbled{H3665}{(H8736)} himself, the wrath{H639} of the LORD{H3068} turned{H7725}{(H8804)} from him, that he would not destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} him altogether{H3617}: and also in Judah{H3063} things{H1697} went well{H2896}."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"So king{H4428} Rehoboam{H7346} strengthened{H2388}{(H8691)} himself in Jerusalem{H3389}, and reigned{H4427}{(H8799)}: for Rehoboam{H7346} was one{H259} and forty{H705} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} seventeen{H7651}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}, the city{H5892} which the LORD{H3068} had chosen{H977}{(H8804)} out of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, to put{H7760}{(H8800)} his name{H8034} there.

2 Chronicles,13,1,Now in the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Jeroboam{H3379} began Abijah{H29} to reign{H4427}{(H8799)} over Judah{H3063}.
2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} three{H7969} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. His mother's{H517} name{H8034} also was Michaiah{H4322} the daughter{H1323} of Uriel{H222} of Gibeah{H1390}. And there was war{H4421} between Abijah{H29} and Jeroboam{H3379}.
2 Chronicles,13,3,"And Abijah{H29} set{H631} the battle{H4421} in array{H631}{(H8799)} with an army{H2428} of valiant men{H1368} of war{H4421}, even four{H702} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376}: Jeroboam{H3379} also set the battle{H4421} in array{H6186}{(H8804)} against him with eight{H8083} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376}, being mighty men{H1368} of valour{H2428}."

2 Chronicles,13,15,"Then the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} gave a shout{H7321}{(H8686)}: and as the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} shouted{H7321}{(H8687)}, it came to pass, that God{H430} smote{H5062}{(H8804)} Jeroboam{H3379} and all Israel{H3478} before{H6440} Abijah{H29} and Judah{H3063}."
2 Chronicles,13,16,And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} fled{H5127}{(H8799)} before{H6440} Judah{H3063}: and God{H430} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them into their hand{H3027}.
2 Chronicles,13,17,And Abijah{H29} and his people{H5971} slew{H5221}{(H8686)} them with a great{H7227} slaughter{H4347}: so there fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} slain{H2491} of Israel{H3478} five{H2568} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} chosen{H977}{(H8803)} men{H376}.
2 Chronicles,13,18,"Thus the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were brought{H3665}{(H8735)} under at that time{H6256}, and the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} prevailed{H553}{(H8799)}, because they relied{H8172}{(H8738)} upon the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"And Abijah{H29} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} Jeroboam{H3379}, and took{H3920}{(H8799)} cities{H5892} from him, Bethel{H1008} with the towns{H1323} thereof, and Jeshanah{H3466} with the towns{H1323} thereof, and Ephrain{H6085} with the towns{H1323} thereof."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Neither did Jeroboam{H3379} recover{H6113}{(H8804)} strength{H3581} again in the days{H3117} of Abijah{H29}: and the LORD{H3068} struck{H5062}{(H8799)} him, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"But Abijah{H29} waxed mighty{H2388}{(H8691)}, and married{H5375}{(H8799)} fourteen{H702}{H6240} wives{H802}, and begat{H3205}{(H8686)} twenty{H6242} and two{H8147} sons{H1121}, and sixteen{H8337}{H6240} daughters{H1323}."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"And the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Abijah{H29}, and his ways{H1870}, and his sayings{H1697}, are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the story{H4097} of the prophet{H5030} Iddo{H5714}."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"So Abijah{H29} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}: and Asa{H609} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead. In his days{H3117} the land{H776} was quiet{H8252}{(H8804)} ten{H6235} years{H8141}."
2 Chronicles,14,2,And Asa{H609} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was good{H2896} and right{H3477} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}:
2 Chronicles,14,3,"For he took away{H5493}{(H8686)} the altars{H4196} of the strange{H5236} gods, and the high places{H1116}, and brake down{H7665}{(H8762)} the images{H4676}, and cut down{H1438}{(H8762)} the groves{H842}:"
2 Chronicles,14,4,"And commanded{H559}{(H8799)} Judah{H3063} to seek{H1875}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}, and to do{H6213}{(H8800)} the law{H8451} and the commandment{H4687}."
2 Chronicles,14,5,Also he took away{H5493}{(H8686)} out of all the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} the high places{H1116} and the images{H2553}: and the kingdom{H4467} was quiet{H8252}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him.
2 Chronicles,14,6,"And he built{H1129}{(H8799)} fenced{H4694} cities{H5892} in Judah{H3063}: for the land{H776} had rest{H8252}{(H8804)}, and he had no war{H4421} in those years{H8141}; because the LORD{H3068} had given him rest{H5117}{(H8689)}."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"Therefore he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Judah{H3063}, Let us build{H1129}{(H8799)} these cities{H5892}, and make about{H5437}{(H8686)} them walls{H2346}, and towers{H4026}, gates{H1817}, and bars{H1280}, while the land{H776} is yet before{H6440} us; because we have sought{H1875}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, we have sought{H1875}{(H8804)} him, and he hath given us rest{H5117}{(H8799)} on every side{H5439}. So they built{H1129}{(H8799)} and prospered{H6743}{(H8686)}."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"And Asa{H609} had an army{H2428} of men that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} targets{H6793} and spears{H7420}, out of Judah{H3063} three{H7969} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505}; and out of Benjamin{H1144}, that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} shields{H4043} and drew{H1869}{(H8802)} bows{H7198}, two hundred{H3967} and fourscore{H8084} thousand{H505}: all these were mighty men{H1368} of valour{H2428}."
2 Chronicles,14,9,"And there came out{H3318}{(H8799)} against them Zerah{H2226} the Ethiopian{H3569} with an host{H2428} of a thousand{H505} thousand{H505}, and three{H7969} hundred{H3967} chariots{H4818}; and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto Mareshah{H4762}."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"Then Asa{H609} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H6440} him, and they set the battle{H4421} in array{H6186}{(H8799)} in the valley{H1516} of Zephathah{H6859} at Mareshah{H4762}."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"And Asa{H609} cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, LORD{H3068}, it is nothing with thee to help{H5826}{(H8800)}, whether{H996} with many{H7227}, or with them that have no power{H3581}: help{H5826}{(H8798)} us, O LORD{H3068} our God{H430}; for we rest{H8172}{(H8738)} on thee, and in thy name{H8034} we go{H935}{(H8804)} against this multitude{H1995}. O LORD{H3068}, thou art our God{H430}; let not man{H582} prevail{H6113}{(H8799)} against thee."
2 Chronicles,14,12,"So the LORD{H3068} smote{H5062}{(H8799)} the Ethiopians{H3569} before{H6440} Asa{H609}, and before{H6440} Judah{H3063}; and the Ethiopians{H3569} fled{H5127}{(H8799)}."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"And Asa{H609} and the people{H5971} that were with him pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} them unto Gerar{H1642}: and the Ethiopians{H3569} were overthrown{H5307}{(H8799)}, that they could not recover{H4241} themselves; for they were destroyed{H7665}{(H8738)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and before{H6440} his host{H4264}; and they carried away{H5375}{(H8799)} very{H3966} much{H7235}{(H8687)} spoil{H7998}."
2 Chronicles,14,14,And they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} all the cities{H5892} round about{H5439} Gerar{H1642}; for the fear{H6343} of the LORD{H3068} came upon them: and they spoiled{H962}{(H8799)} all the cities{H5892}; for there was exceeding much{H7227} spoil{H961} in them.
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They smote{H5221}{(H8689)} also the tents{H168} of cattle{H4735}, and carried away{H7617}{(H8799)} sheep{H6629} and camels{H1581} in abundance{H7230}, and returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,15,1,And the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} came upon Azariah{H5838} the son{H1121} of Oded{H5752}:
2 Chronicles,15,2,"And he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} to meet{H6440} Asa{H609}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye me, Asa{H609}, and all Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144}; The LORD{H3068} is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek{H1875}{(H8799)} him, he will be found{H4672}{(H8735)} of you; but if ye forsake{H5800}{(H8799)} him, he will forsake{H5800}{(H8799)} you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"Now for a long{H7227} season{H3117} Israel{H3478} hath been without{H3808} the true{H571} God{H430}, and without a teaching{H3384}{(H8688)} priest{H3548}, and without law{H8451}."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But when they in their trouble{H6862} did turn{H7725}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, and sought{H1245}{(H8762)} him, he was found{H4672}{(H8735)} of them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"And in those times{H6256} there was no peace{H7965} to him that went out{H3318}{(H8802)}, nor to him that came in{H935}{(H8802)}, but great{H7227} vexations{H4103} were upon all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the countries{H776}."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"And nation{H1471} was destroyed{H3807}{(H8795)} of nation{H1471}, and city{H5892} of city{H5892}: for God{H430} did vex{H2000}{(H8804)} them with all adversity{H6869}."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"Be ye strong{H2388}{(H8798)} therefore, and let not your hands{H3027} be weak{H7503}{(H8799)}: for your work{H6468} shall be{H3426} rewarded{H7939}."
2 Chronicles,15,8,"And when Asa{H609} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} these words{H1697}, and the prophecy{H5016} of Oded{H5752} the prophet{H5030}, he took courage{H2388}{(H8694)}, and put away{H5674}{(H8686)} the abominable idols{H8251} out of all the land{H776} of Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144}, and out of the cities{H5892} which he had taken{H3920}{(H8804)} from mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}, and renewed{H2318}{(H8762)} the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068}, that was before{H6440} the porch{H197} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"And he gathered{H6908}{(H8799)} all Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144}, and the strangers{H1481}{(H8802)} with them out of Ephraim{H669} and Manasseh{H4519}, and out of Simeon{H8095}: for they fell{H5307}{(H8804)} to him out of Israel{H3478} in abundance{H7230}, when they saw{H7200}{(H8800)} that the LORD{H3068} his God{H430} was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together{H6908}{(H8735)} at Jerusalem{H3389} in the third{H7992} month{H2320}, in the fifteenth{H2568}{H6240} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of Asa{H609}."
2 Chronicles,15,11,"And they offered{H2076}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} the same time{H3117}, of the spoil{H7998} which they had brought{H935}{(H8689)}, seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} oxen{H1241} and seven{H7651} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}."
2 Chronicles,15,12,And they entered{H935}{(H8799)} into a covenant{H1285} to seek{H1875}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1} with all their heart{H3824} and with all their soul{H5315};
2 Chronicles,15,13,"That whosoever would not seek{H1875}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} should be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)}, whether{H4480} small{H6996} or great{H1419}, whether man{H376} or woman{H802}."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"And they sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto the LORD{H3068} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, and with shouting{H8643}, and with trumpets{H2689}, and with cornets{H7782}."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"And all Judah{H3063} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} at the oath{H7621}: for they had sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} with all their heart{H3824}, and sought{H1245}{(H8765)} him with their whole desire{H7522}; and he was found{H4672}{(H8735)} of them: and the LORD{H3068} gave them rest{H5117}{(H8799)} round about{H5439}."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"And also concerning Maachah{H4601} the mother{H517} of Asa{H609} the king{H4428}, he removed{H5493}{(H8689)} her from being queen{H1377}, because she had made{H6213}{(H8804)} an idol{H4656} in a grove{H842}: and Asa{H609} cut down{H3772}{(H8799)} her idol{H4656}, and stamped{H1854}{(H8686)} it, and burnt{H8313}{(H8799)} it at the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}."
2 Chronicles,15,17,But the high places{H1116} were not taken away{H5493}{(H8804)} out of Israel{H3478}: nevertheless the heart{H3824} of Asa{H609} was perfect{H8003} all his days{H3117}.
2 Chronicles,15,18,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} into the house{H1004} of God{H430} the things that his father{H1} had dedicated{H6944}, and that he himself had dedicated{H6944}, silver{H3701}, and gold{H2091}, and vessels{H3627}."
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no more war{H4421} unto the five{H2568} and thirtieth{H7970} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of Asa{H609}.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the six{H8337} and thirtieth{H7970} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of Asa{H609} Baasha{H1201} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} against Judah{H3063}, and built{H1129}{(H8799)} Ramah{H7414}, to the intent that{H1115} he might let{H5414}{(H8800)} none go out{H3318}{(H8802)} or come in{H935}{(H8802)} to Asa{H609} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"Then Asa{H609} brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} silver{H3701} and gold{H2091} out of the treasures{H214} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} and of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Benhadad{H1130} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} at Damascus{H1834}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"There is a league{H1285} between me and thee, as there was between my father{H1} and thy father{H1}: behold, I have sent{H7971}{(H8804)} thee silver{H3701} and gold{H2091}; go{H3212}{(H8798)}, break{H6565}{(H8685)} thy league{H1285} with Baasha{H1201} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, that he may depart{H5927}{(H8799)} from me."
2 Chronicles,16,4,"And Benhadad{H1130} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto king{H4428} Asa{H609}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} the captains{H8269} of his armies{H2428} against the cities{H5892} of Israel{H3478}; and they smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Ijon{H5859}, and Dan{H1835}, and Abelmaim{H66}, and all the store{H4543} cities{H5892} of Naphtali{H5321}."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Baasha{H1201} heard{H8085}{(H8800)} it, that he left off{H2308}{(H8799)} building{H1129}{(H8800)} of Ramah{H7414}, and let his work{H4399} cease{H7673}{(H8686)}."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then Asa{H609} the king{H4428} took{H3947}{(H8804)} all Judah{H3063}; and they carried away{H5375}{(H8799)} the stones{H68} of Ramah{H7414}, and the timber{H6086} thereof, wherewith Baasha{H1201} was building{H1129}{(H8804)}; and he built{H1129}{(H8799)} therewith Geba{H1387} and Mizpah{H4709}."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"And at that time{H6256} Hanani{H2607} the seer{H7200}{(H8802)} came{H935}{(H8804)} to Asa{H609} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Because thou hast relied{H8172}{(H8736)} on the king{H4428} of Syria{H758}, and not relied{H8172}{(H8738)} on the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, therefore is the host{H2428} of the king{H4428} of Syria{H758} escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} out of thine hand{H3027}."

Therefore they compassed about{H5437}{(H8799)} him to fight{H3898}{(H8736)}: but Jehoshaphat{H3092} cried out{H2199}{(H8799)}, and the LORD{H3068} helped{H5826}{(H8804)} him; and God{H430} moved{H5496}{(H8686)} them to depart from him."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"For it came to pass, that, when the captains{H8269} of the chariots{H7393} perceived{H7200}{(H8800)} that it was not the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, they turned back again{H7725}{(H8799)} from pursuing{H310} him."

2 Chronicles,18,34,And the battle{H4421} increased{H5927}{(H8799)} that day{H3117}: howbeit the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} stayed himself up{H5975}{(H8689)} in his chariot{H4818} against{H5227} the Syrians{H758} until the even{H6153}: and about the time{H6256} of the sun{H8121} going down{H935}{(H8800)} he died{H4191}{(H8799)}.

2 Chronicles,21,8,"In his days{H3117} the Edomites{H123} revolted{H6586}{(H8804)} from under the dominion{H3027} of Judah{H3063}, and made{H4427}{(H8686)} themselves a king{H4428}."
2 Chronicles,21,9,"Then Jehoram{H3088} went forth{H5674}{(H8799)} with his princes{H8269}, and all his chariots{H7393} with him: and he rose up{H6965}{(H8804)} by night{H3915}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the Edomites{H123} which compassed him in{H5437}{(H8802)}, and the captains{H8269} of the chariots{H7393}."
2 Chronicles,21,10,So the Edomites{H123} revolted{H6586}{(H8799)} from under the hand{H3027} of Judah{H3063} unto this day{H3117}. The same time{H6256} also did Libnah{H3841} revolt{H6586}{(H8799)} from under his hand{H3027}; because he had forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of his fathers{H1}.
2 Chronicles,21,11,"Moreover he made{H6213}{(H8804)} high places{H1116} in the mountains{H2022} of Judah{H3063}, and caused the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} to commit fornication{H2181}{(H8686)}, and compelled{H5080}{(H8686)} Judah{H3063} thereto."
2 Chronicles,21,12,"And there came{H935}{(H8799)} a writing{H4385} to him from Elijah{H452} the prophet{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of David{H1732} thy father{H1}, Because thou hast not walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in the ways{H1870} of Jehoshaphat{H3092} thy father{H1}, nor in the ways{H1870} of Asa{H609} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063},"
2 Chronicles,21,13,"But hast walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the way{H1870} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, and hast made Judah{H3063} and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} to go a whoring{H2181}{(H8686)}, like to the whoredoms{H2181}{(H8687)} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}, and also hast slain{H2026}{(H8804)} thy brethren{H251} of thy father's{H1} house{H1004}, which were better{H2896} than thyself:"
2 Chronicles,21,14,"Behold, with a great{H1419} plague{H4046} will the LORD{H3068} smite{H5062}{(H8802)} thy people{H5971}, and thy children{H1121}, and thy wives{H802}, and all thy goods{H7399}:"
2 Chronicles,21,15,"And thou shalt have great{H7227} sickness{H2483} by disease{H4245} of thy bowels{H4578}, until thy bowels{H4578} fall out{H3318}{(H8799)} by reason of the sickness{H2483} day{H3117} by day{H3117}."
2 Chronicles,21,16,"Moreover the LORD{H3068} stirred up{H5782}{(H8686)} against Jehoram{H3088} the spirit{H7307} of the Philistines{H6430}, and of the Arabians{H6163}, that were near{H5921}{H3027} the Ethiopians{H3569}:"
2 Chronicles,21,17,"And they came up{H5927}{(H8799)} into Judah{H3063}, and brake{H1234}{(H8799)} into it, and carried away{H7617}{(H8799)} all the substance{H7399} that was found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and his sons{H1121} also, and his wives{H802}; so that there was never a son{H1121} left{H7604}{(H8738)} him, save Jehoahaz{H3059}, the youngest{H6996} of his sons{H1121}."
2 Chronicles,21,18,And after{H310} all this the LORD{H3068} smote{H5062}{(H8804)} him in his bowels{H4578} with an incurable{H369}{H4832} disease{H2483}.
2 Chronicles,21,19,"And it came to pass, that in process of time{H3117}, after{H3318}{(H8800)}{H6256} the end{H7093} of two{H8147} years{H3117}, his bowels{H4578} fell out{H3318}{(H8804)} by reason{H5973} of his sickness{H2483}: so he died{H4191}{(H8799)} of sore{H7451} diseases{H8463}. And his people{H5971} made{H6213}{(H8804)} no burning{H8316} for him, like the burning{H8316} of his fathers{H1}."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"Thirty{H7970} and two{H8147} years old{H1121} was he when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} in Jerusalem{H3389} eight{H8083} years{H8141}, and departed{H3212}{(H8799)} without being desired{H2532}. Howbeit they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, but not in the sepulchres{H6913} of the kings{H4428}."
2 Chronicles,22,1,And the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} made{H4427} Ahaziah{H274} his youngest{H6996} son{H1121} king{H4427}{(H8686)} in his stead: for the band of men{H1416} that came{H935}{(H8802)} with the Arabians{H6163} to the camp{H4264} had slain{H2026}{(H8804)} all the eldest{H7223}. So Ahaziah{H274} the son{H1121} of Jehoram{H3088} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)}.
2 Chronicles,22,2,"Forty{H705} and two{H8147} years{H8141} old{H1121} was Ahaziah{H274} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} one{H259} year{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. His mother's{H517} name{H8034} also was Athaliah{H6271} the daughter{H1323} of Omri{H6018}."
2 Chronicles,22,3,He also walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in the ways{H1870} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}: for his mother{H517} was his counsellor{H3289}{(H8802)} to do wickedly{H7561}{(H8687)}.
2 Chronicles,22,4,Wherefore he did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068} like the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}: for they were his counsellors{H3289}{(H8802)} after{H310} the death{H4194} of his father{H1} to his destruction{H4889}.
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He walked{H1980}{(H8804)} also after their counsel{H6098}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} with Jehoram{H3088} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} to war{H4421} against Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758} at Ramothgilead{H7433}{H1568}: and the Syrians{H7421} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Joram{H3141}."
2 Chronicles,22,6,"And he returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to be healed{H7495}{(H8692)} in Jezreel{H3157} because of the wounds{H4347} which were given{H5221}{(H8689)} him at Ramah{H7414}, when he fought{H3898}{(H8736)} with Hazael{H2371} king{H4428} of Syria{H758}. And Azariah{H5838} the son{H1121} of Jehoram{H3088} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} went down{H3381}{(H8804)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} Jehoram{H3088} the son{H1121} of Ahab{H256} at Jezreel{H3157}, because he was sick{H2470}{(H8802)}."
2 Chronicles,22,7,"And the destruction{H8395} of Ahaziah{H274} was of God{H430} by coming{H935}{(H8800)} to Joram{H3141}: for when he was come{H935}{(H8800)}, he went out{H3318}{(H8804)} with Jehoram{H3088} against Jehu{H3058} the son{H1121} of Nimshi{H5250}, whom the LORD{H3068} had anointed{H4886}{(H8804)} to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"And it came to pass, that, when Jehu{H3058} was executing judgment{H8199}{(H8736)} upon the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063}, and the sons{H1121} of the brethren{H251} of Ahaziah{H274}, that ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} to Ahaziah{H274}, he slew{H2026}{(H8799)} them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"And he sought{H1245}{(H8762)} Ahaziah{H274}: and they caught{H3920}{(H8799)} him,(for he was hid{H2244}{(H8693)} in Samaria{H8111},) and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to Jehu{H3058}: and when they had slain{H4191}{(H8686)} him, they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him: Because, said{H559}{(H8804)} they, he is the son{H1121} of Jehoshaphat{H3092}, who sought{H1875}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} with all his heart{H3824}. So the house{H1004} of Ahaziah{H274} had no power{H3581} to keep{H6113}{(H8800)} still the kingdom{H4467}."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"But when Athaliah{H6271} the mother{H517} of Ahaziah{H274} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that her son{H1121} was dead{H4191}{(H8804)}, she arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and destroyed{H1696}{(H8762)} all the seed{H2233} royal{H4467} of the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath{H3090}, the daughter{H1323} of the king{H4428}, took{H3947}{(H8799)} Joash{H3101} the son{H1121} of Ahaziah{H274}, and stole{H1589}{(H8799)} him from among{H8432} the king's{H4428} sons{H1121} that were slain{H4191}{(H8716)}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} him and his nurse{H3243}{(H8688)} in a bedchamber{H2315}{H4296}. So Jehoshabeath{H3090}, the daughter{H1323} of king{H4428} Jehoram{H3088}, the wife{H802} of Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548},(for she was the sister{H269} of Ahaziah{H274},) hid{H5641}{(H8686)} him from{H6440} Athaliah{H6271}, so that she slew{H4191}{(H8689)} him not."
2 Chronicles,22,12,And he was with them hid{H2244}{(H8693)} in the house{H1004} of God{H430} six{H8337} years{H8141}: and Athaliah{H6271} reigned{H4427}{(H8802)} over the land{H776}.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"And in the seventh{H7637} year{H8141} Jehoiada{H3077} strengthened{H2388}{(H8694)} himself, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the captains{H8269} of hundreds{H3967}, Azariah{H5838} the son{H1121} of Jeroham{H3395}, and Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Jehohanan{H3076}, and Azariah{H5838} the son{H1121} of Obed{H5744}, and Maaseiah{H4641} the son{H1121} of Adaiah{H5718}, and Elishaphat{H478} the son{H1121} of Zichri{H2147}, into covenant{H1285} with him."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"And they went about{H5437}{(H8799)} in Judah{H3063}, and gathered{H6908}{(H8799)} the Levites{H3881} out of all the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and the chief{H7218} of the fathers{H1} of Israel{H3478}, and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,23,3,"And all the congregation{H6951} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with the king{H4428} in the house{H1004} of God{H430}. And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Behold, the king's{H4428} son{H1121} shall reign{H4427}{(H8799)}, as the LORD{H3068} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)} of the sons{H1121} of David{H1732}."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"This is the thing{H1697} that ye shall do{H6213}{(H8799)}; A third part{H7992} of you entering{H935}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676}, of the priests{H3548} and of the Levites{H3881}, shall be porters{H7778} of the doors{H5592};"
2 Chronicles,23,5,And a third part{H7992} shall be at the king's{H4428} house{H1004}; and a third part{H7992} at the gate{H8179} of the foundation{H3247}: and all the people{H5971} shall be in the courts{H2691} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}.
2 Chronicles,23,6,"But let none come{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, save the priests{H3548}, and they that minister{H8334}{(H8764)} of the Levites{H3881}; they shall go in{H935}{(H8799)}, for they are holy{H6944}: but all the people{H5971} shall keep{H8104}{(H8799)} the watch{H4931} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,23,7,"And the Levites{H3881} shall compass{H5362}{(H8689)} the king{H4428} round about{H5439}, every man{H376} with his weapons{H3627} in his hand{H3027}; and whosoever else cometh{H935}{(H8802)} into the house{H1004}, he shall be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)}: but be ye with the king{H4428} when he cometh in{H935}{(H8800)}, and when he goeth out{H3318}{(H8800)}."
2 Chronicles,23,8,"So the Levites{H3881} and all Judah{H3063} did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to all things that Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his men{H582} that were to come in{H935}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676}, with them that were to go{H3318}{(H8802)} out on the sabbath{H7676}: for Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} dismissed{H6358}{(H8804)} not the courses{H4256}."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Moreover Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} to the captains{H8269} of hundreds{H3967} spears{H2595}, and bucklers{H4043}, and shields{H7982}, that had been king{H4428} David's{H1732}, which were in the house{H1004} of God{H430}."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"And he set{H5975}{(H8686)} all the people{H5971}, every man{H376} having his weapon{H7973} in his hand{H3027}, from the right{H3233} side{H3802} of the temple{H1004} to the left{H8042} side{H3802} of the temple{H1004}, along by the altar{H4196} and the temple{H1004}, by the king{H4428} round about{H5439}."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Then they brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} the king's{H4428} son{H1121}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} upon him the crown{H5145}, and gave him the testimony{H5715}, and made him king{H4427}{(H8686)}. And Jehoiada{H3077} and his sons{H1121} anointed{H4886}{(H8799)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, God save{H2421}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}."
2 Chronicles,23,12,"Now when Athaliah{H6271} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the noise{H6963} of the people{H5971} running{H7323}{(H8801)} and praising{H1984}{(H8764)} the king{H4428}, she came{H935}{(H8799)} to the people{H5971} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}:"
2 Chronicles,23,13,"And she looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, the king{H4428} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} at his pillar{H5982} at the entering in{H3996}, and the princes{H8269} and the trumpets{H2689} by the king{H4428}: and all the people{H5971} of the land{H776} rejoiced{H8056}, and sounded{H8628}{(H8802)} with trumpets{H2689}, also the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} with instruments{H3627} of musick{H7892}, and such as taught{H3045}{(H8688)} to sing praise{H1984}{(H8763)}. Then Athaliah{H6271} rent{H7167}{(H8799)} her clothes{H899}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Treason{H7195}, Treason{H7195}."
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Then Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548} brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} the captains{H8269} of hundreds{H3967} that were set over{H6485}{(H8803)} the host{H2428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Have her forth{H3318}{(H8685)} of the ranges{H1004}{H7713}: and whoso followeth{H935}{(H8802)}{H310} her, let him be slain{H4191}{(H8714)} with the sword{H2719}. For the priest{H3548} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Slay{H4191}{(H8686)} her not in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they laid{H7760}{(H8799)} hands{H3027} on her; and when she was come{H935}{(H8799)} to the entering{H3996} of the horse{H5483} gate{H8179} by the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, they slew{H4191}{(H8686)} her there."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"And Jehoiada{H3077} made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} between him, and between all the people{H5971}, and between the king{H4428}, that they should be the LORD'S{H3068} people{H5971}."
2 Chronicles,23,17,"Then all the people{H5971} went{H935}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of Baal{H1168}, and brake it down{H5422}{(H8799)}, and brake{H7665} his altars{H4196} and his images{H6754} in pieces{H7665}{(H8765)}, and slew{H2026}{(H8804)} Mattan{H4977} the priest{H3548} of Baal{H1168} before{H6440} the altars{H4196}."
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Also Jehoiada{H3077} appointed{H7760}{(H8799)} the offices{H6486} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} by the hand{H3027} of the priests{H3548} the Levites{H3881}, whom David{H1732} had distributed{H2505}{(H8804)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} the burnt offerings{H5930} of the LORD{H3068}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, with rejoicing{H8057} and with singing{H7892}, as it was ordained by{H3027} David{H1732}."
2 Chronicles,23,19,"And he set{H5975}{(H8686)} the porters{H7778} at the gates{H8179} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, that none which was unclean{H2931} in any thing{H1697} should enter in{H935}{(H8799)}."
2 Chronicles,23,20,"And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} the captains{H8269} of hundreds{H3967}, and the nobles{H117}, and the governors{H4910}{(H8802)} of the people{H5971}, and all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, and brought down{H3381}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} from the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} through{H8432} the high{H5945} gate{H8179} into the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and set{H3427}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} upon the throne{H3678} of the kingdom{H4467}."
2 Chronicles,23,21,"And all the people{H5971} of the land{H776} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)}: and the city{H5892} was quiet{H8252}{(H8804)}, after that they had slain{H4191}{(H8689)} Athaliah{H6271} with the sword{H2719}."
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash{H3101} was seven{H7651} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} forty{H705} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. His mother's{H517} name{H8034} also was Zibiah{H6645} of Beersheba{H884}."
2 Chronicles,24,2,And Joash{H3101} did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068} all the days{H3117} of Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548}.
2 Chronicles,24,3,And Jehoiada{H3077} took{H5375}{(H8799)} for him two{H8147} wives{H802}; and he begat{H3205}{(H8686)} sons{H1121} and daughters{H1323}.
2 Chronicles,24,4,"And it came to pass after{H310} this, that Joash{H3101} was minded{H3820} to repair{H2318}{(H8763)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,24,5,"And he gathered together{H6908}{(H8799)} the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to them, Go out{H3318}{(H8798)} unto the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and gather{H6908}{(H8798)} of all Israel{H3478} money{H3701} to repair{H2388}{(H8763)} the house{H1004} of your God{H430} from{H1767} year{H8141} to year{H8141}, and see that ye hasten{H4116}{(H8762)} the matter{H1697}. Howbeit the Levites{H3881} hastened{H4116}{(H8765)} it not."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"And the king{H4428} called{H7121}{(H8799)} for Jehoiada{H3077} the chief{H7218}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why hast thou not required{H1875}{(H8804)} of the Levites{H3881} to bring in{H935}{(H8687)} out of Judah{H3063} and out of Jerusalem{H3389} the collection{H4864}, according to the commandment of Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of the LORD{H3068}, and of the congregation{H6951} of Israel{H3478}, for the tabernacle{H168} of witness{H5715}?"
2 Chronicles,24,7,"For the sons{H1121} of Athaliah{H6271}, that wicked{H4849} woman, had broken up{H6555}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of God{H430}; and also all the dedicated things{H6944} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} did they bestow{H6213}{(H8804)} upon Baalim{H1168}."
2 Chronicles,24,8,"And at the king's{H4428} commandment{H559}{(H8799)} they made{H6213}{(H8799)} a{H259} chest{H727}, and set{H5414}{(H8799)} it without{H2351} at the gate{H8179} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,24,9,"And they made{H5414}{(H8799)} a proclamation{H6963} through Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, to bring in{H935}{(H8687)} to the LORD{H3068} the collection{H4864} that Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of God{H430} laid upon Israel{H3478} in the wilderness{H4057}."
2 Chronicles,24,10,"And all the princes{H8269} and all the people{H5971} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)}, and brought in{H935}{(H8686)}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} into the chest{H727}, until they had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)}."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"Now it came to pass, that at what time{H6256} the chest{H727} was brought{H935}{(H8686)} unto the king's{H4428} office{H6486} by the hand{H3027} of the Levites{H3881}, and when they saw{H7200}{(H8800)} that there was much{H7227} money{H3701}, the king's{H4428} scribe{H5608}{(H8802)} and the high{H7218} priest's{H3548} officer{H6496} came{H935}{(H8804)} and emptied{H6168}{(H8762)} the chest{H727}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} it, and carried{H7725} it to his place{H4725} again{H7725}{(H8686)}. Thus they did{H6213}{(H8804)} day{H3117} by day{H3117}, and gathered{H622}{(H8799)} money{H3701} in abundance{H7230}."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"And the king{H4428} and Jehoiada{H3077} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it to such as did{H6213}{(H8802)} the work{H4399} of the service{H5656} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and hired{H7936}{(H8802)} masons{H2672}{(H8802)} and carpenters{H2796} to repair{H2318}{(H8763)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and also such as wrought{H2796} iron{H1270} and brass{H5178} to mend{H2388}{(H8763)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"So the workmen{H4399}{H6213}{(H8802)} wrought{H6213}{(H8799)}, and the work{H4399} was{H5927}{(H8799)} perfected{H724} by them{H3027}, and they set{H5975}{(H8686)} the house{H1004} of God{H430} in his state{H4971}, and strengthened{H553}{(H8762)} it."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"And when they had finished{H3615}{(H8763)} it, they brought{H935}{(H8689)} the rest{H7605} of the money{H3701} before{H6440} the king{H4428} and Jehoiada{H3077}, whereof were made{H6213}{(H8799)} vessels{H3627} for the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, even vessels{H3627} to minister{H8335}, and to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} withal, and spoons{H3709}, and vessels{H3627} of gold{H2091} and silver{H3701}. And they offered{H5927}{(H8688)} burnt offerings{H5930} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} continually{H8548} all the days{H3117} of Jehoiada{H3077}."
2 Chronicles,24,15,"But Jehoiada{H3077} waxed old{H2204}{(H8799)}, and was full{H7646}{(H8799)} of days{H3117} when he died{H4191}{(H8799)}; an hundred{H3967} and thirty{H7970} years{H8141} old{H1121} was he when he died{H4194}."
2 Chronicles,24,16,"And they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the city{H5892} of David{H1732} among the kings{H4428}, because he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} good{H2896} in Israel{H3478}, both toward God{H430}, and toward his house{H1004}."
2 Chronicles,24,17,"Now after{H310} the death{H4194} of Jehoiada{H3077} came{H935}{(H8804)} the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063}, and made obeisance{H7812}{(H8691)} to the king{H4428}. Then the king{H4428} hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto them."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"And they left{H5800}{(H8799)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} groves{H842} and idols{H6091}: and wrath{H7110} came upon Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389} for this their trespass{H819}."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"Yet he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} prophets{H5030} to them, to bring them again{H7725}{(H8687)} unto the LORD{H3068}; and they testified{H5749}{(H8686)} against them: but they would not give ear{H238}{(H8689)}."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"And the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} came{H3847}{(H8804)} upon Zechariah{H2148} the son{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548}, which stood{H5975}{(H8799)} above the people{H5971}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} God{H430}, Why transgress{H5674}{(H8802)} ye the commandments{H4687} of the LORD{H3068}, that ye cannot prosper{H6743}{(H8686)}? because ye have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, he hath also forsaken{H5800}{(H8799)} you."
2 Chronicles,24,21,"And they conspired{H7194}{(H8799)} against him, and stoned{H7275}{(H8799)} him with stones{H68} at the commandment{H4687} of the king{H4428} in the court{H2691} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,24,22,"Thus Joash{H3101} the king{H4428} remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} not the kindness{H2617} which Jehoiada{H3077} his father{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)} to him, but slew{H2026}{(H8799)} his son{H1121}. And when he died{H4194}, he said{H559}{(H8804)}, The LORD{H3068} look{H7200}{(H8799)} upon it, and require{H1875}{(H8799)} it."
2 Chronicles,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end{H8622} of the year{H8141}, that the host{H2428} of Syria{H758} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} against him: and they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, and destroyed{H7843}{(H8686)} all the princes{H8269} of the people{H5971} from among the people{H5971}, and sent{H7971}{(H8765)} all the spoil{H7998} of them unto the king{H4428} of Damascus{H1834}."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"For the army{H2428} of the Syrians{H758} came{H935}{(H8804)} with a small{H4705} company of men{H582}, and the LORD{H3068} delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} a very{H3966} great{H7230} host{H2428} into their hand{H3027}, because they had forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}. So they executed{H6213}{(H8804)} judgment{H8201} against Joash{H3101}."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"And when they were departed{H3212}{(H8800)} from him,(for they left{H5800}{(H8804)} him in great{H7227} diseases{H4251},) his own servants{H5650} conspired{H7194}{(H8694)} against him for the blood{H1818} of the sons{H1121} of Jehoiada{H3077} the priest{H3548}, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} him on his bed{H4296}, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}: and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, but they buried{H6912}{(H8804)} him not in the sepulchres{H6913} of the kings{H4428}."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"And these are they that conspired{H7194}{(H8693)} against him; Zabad{H2066} the son{H1121} of Shimeath{H8100} an Ammonitess{H5985}, and Jehozabad{H3075} the son{H1121} of Shimrith{H8116} a Moabitess{H4125}."
2 Chronicles,24,27,"Now concerning his sons{H1121}, and the greatness{H7235}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H7230} of the burdens{H4853} laid upon him, and the repairing{H3247} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}, behold, they are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the story{H4097} of the book{H5612} of the kings{H4428}. And Amaziah{H558} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah{H558} was twenty{H6242} and five{H2568} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} twenty{H6242} and nine{H8672} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Jehoaddan{H3086} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, but not with a perfect{H8003} heart{H3824}."
2 Chronicles,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom{H4467} was established{H2388}{(H8804)} to him, that he slew{H2026}{(H8799)} his servants{H5650} that had killed{H5221}{(H8688)} the king{H4428} his father{H1}."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"But he slew{H4191}{(H8689)} not their children{H1121}, but did as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} in the book{H5612} of Moses{H4872}, where the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The fathers{H1} shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)} for the children{H1121}, neither shall the children{H1121} die{H4191}{(H8799)} for the fathers{H1}, but every man{H376} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} for his own sin{H2399}."
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah{H558} gathered{H6908} Judah{H3063} together{H6908}{(H8799)}, and made{H5975}{(H8686)} them captains{H8269} over thousands{H505}, and captains{H8269} over hundreds{H3967}, according to the houses{H1004} of their fathers{H1}, throughout all Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144}: and he numbered{H6485}{(H8799)} them from twenty{H6242} years{H8141} old{H1121} and above{H4605}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} them three{H7969} hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} choice{H977}{(H8803)} men, able to go forth{H3318}{(H8802)} to war{H6635}, that could handle{H270}{(H8802)} spear{H7420} and shield{H6793}."
2 Chronicles,25,6,He hired{H7936}{(H8799)} also an hundred{H3967} thousand{H505} mighty{H1368} men of valour{H2428} out of Israel{H3478} for an hundred{H3967} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701}.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But there came{H935}{(H8804)} a man{H376} of God{H430} to him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, O king{H4428}, let not the army{H6635} of Israel{H3478} go{H935}{(H8799)} with thee; for the LORD{H3068} is not with Israel{H3478}, to wit, with all the children{H1121} of Ephraim{H669}."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But if thou wilt go{H935}{(H8798)}, do{H6213}{(H8798)} it, be strong{H2388}{(H8798)} for the battle{H4421}: God{H430} shall make thee fall{H3782}{(H8686)} before{H6440} the enemy{H341}{(H8802)}: for God{H430} hath{H3426} power{H3581} to help{H5826}{(H8800)}, and to cast down{H3782}{(H8687)}."
2 Chronicles,25,9,"And Amaziah{H558} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the man{H376} of God{H430}, But what shall we do{H6213}{(H8800)} for the hundred{H3967} talents{H3603} which I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} to the army{H1416} of Israel{H3478}? And the man{H376} of God{H430} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} is{H3426} able to give{H5414}{(H8800)} thee much more{H7235}{(H8687)} than this."
2 Chronicles,25,10,"Then Amaziah{H558} separated{H914}{(H8686)} them, to wit, the army{H1416} that was come{H935}{(H8804)} to him out of Ephraim{H669}, to go{H3212} home{H4725} again{H3212}{(H8800)}: wherefore their anger{H639} was greatly{H3966} kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against Judah{H3063}, and they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} home{H4725} in great{H2750} anger{H639}."
2 Chronicles,25,11,"And Amaziah{H558} strengthened{H2388}{(H8694)} himself, and led forth{H5090}{(H8799)} his people{H5971}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to the valley{H1516} of salt{H4417}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} of the children{H1121} of Seir{H8165} ten{H6235} thousand{H505}."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"And other ten{H6235} thousand{H505} left alive{H2416} did the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} carry away captive{H7617}{(H8804)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them unto the top{H7218} of the rock{H5553}, and cast them down{H7993}{(H8686)} from the top{H7218} of the rock{H5553}, that they all were broken in pieces{H1234}{(H8738)}."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"But the soldiers{H1121} of the army{H1416} which Amaziah{H558} sent back{H7725}{(H8689)}, that they should not go{H3212}{(H8800)} with him to battle{H4421}, fell{H6584}{(H8799)} upon the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, from Samaria{H8111} even unto Bethhoron{H1032}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} three{H7969} thousand{H505} of them, and took{H962}{(H8799)} much{H7227} spoil{H961}."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after{H310} that Amaziah{H558} was come{H935}{(H8800)} from the slaughter{H5221}{(H8687)} of the Edomites{H130}, that he brought{H935}{(H8686)} the gods{H430} of the children{H1121} of Seir{H8165}, and set them up{H5975}{(H8686)} to be his gods{H430}, and bowed down{H7812}{(H8691)} himself before{H6440} them, and burned incense{H6999}{(H8762)} unto them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"Wherefore the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} against Amaziah{H558}, and he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto him a prophet{H5030}, which said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why hast thou sought{H1875}{(H8804)} after the gods{H430} of the people{H5971}, which could not deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} their own people{H5971} out of thine hand{H3027}?"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked{H1696}{(H8763)} with him, that the king said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Art thou made{H5414}{(H8804)} of the king's{H4428} counsel{H3289}{(H8802)}? forbear{H2308}{(H8798)}; why shouldest thou be smitten{H5221}{(H8686)}? Then the prophet{H5030} forbare{H2308}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that God{H430} hath determined{H3289}{(H8804)} to destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} thee, because thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} this, and hast not hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto my counsel{H6098}."
2 Chronicles,25,17,"Then Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} took advice{H3289}{(H8735)}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Joash{H3101}, the son{H1121} of Jehoahaz{H3059}, the son{H1121} of Jehu{H3058}, king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, let us see one another{H7200}{(H8691)} in the face{H6440}."
2 Chronicles,25,18,"And Joash{H3101} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The thistle{H2336} that was in Lebanon{H3844} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to the cedar{H730} that was in Lebanon{H3844}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} thy daughter{H1323} to my son{H1121} to wife{H802}: and there passed by{H5674}{(H8799)} a wild{H7704} beast{H2416} that was in Lebanon{H3844}, and trode down{H7429}{(H8799)} the thistle{H2336}."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"Thou sayest{H559}{(H8804)}, Lo, thou hast smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} the Edomites{H123}; and thine heart{H3820} lifteth thee up{H5375}{(H8804)} to boast{H3513}{(H8687)}: abide{H3427}{(H8798)} now at home{H1004}; why shouldest thou meddle{H1624}{(H8691)} to thine hurt{H7451}, that thou shouldest fall{H5307}{(H8804)}, even thou, and Judah{H3063} with thee?"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah{H558} would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}; for it came of God{H430}, that he might deliver{H5414}{(H8800)} them into the hand{H3027} of their enemies, because they sought{H1875}{(H8804)} after the gods{H430} of Edom{H123}."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Joash{H3101} the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} went up{H5927}{(H8799)}; and they saw one another{H7200}{(H8691)} in the face{H6440}, both he and Amaziah{H558} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, at Bethshemesh{H1053}, which belongeth to Judah{H3063}."
2 Chronicles,25,22,"And Judah{H3063} was put to the worse{H5062}{(H8735)} before{H6440} Israel{H3478}, and they fled{H5127}{(H8799)} every man{H376} to his tent{H168}."

2 Chronicles,26,8,And the Ammonites{H5984} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} gifts{H4503} to Uzziah{H5818}: and his name{H8034} spread abroad{H3212}{(H8799)} even to the entering{H935}{(H8800)} in of Egypt{H4714}; for he strengthened{H2388}{(H8689)} himself exceedingly{H4605}.
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah{H5818} built{H1129}{(H8799)} towers{H4026} in Jerusalem{H3389} at the corner{H6438} gate{H8179}, and at the valley{H1516} gate{H8179}, and at the turning{H4740} of the wall, and fortified{H2388}{(H8762)} them."

And his name{H8034} spread{H3318}{(H8799)} far abroad{H7350}; for he was marvellously{H6381}{(H8689)} helped{H5826}{(H8736)}, till{H3588} he was strong{H2388}{(H8804)}."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he was strong{H2393}, his heart{H3820} was lifted up{H1361}{(H8804)} to his destruction{H7843}{(H8687)}: for he transgressed{H4603}{(H8799)} against the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8687)} upon the altar{H4196} of incense{H7004}."

2 Chronicles,26,18,"And they withstood{H5975}{(H8799)} Uzziah{H5818} the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah{H5818}, to burn incense{H6999}{(H8687)} unto the LORD{H3068}, but to the priests{H3548} the sons{H1121} of Aaron{H175}, that are consecrated{H6942}{(H8794)} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8687)}: go out{H3318}{(H8798)} of the sanctuary{H4720}; for thou hast trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)}; neither shall it be for thine honour{H3519} from the LORD{H3068} God{H430}."
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Then Uzziah{H5818} was wroth{H2196}{(H8799)}, and had a censer{H4730} in his hand{H3027} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8687)}: and while he was wroth{H2196}{(H8800)} with the priests{H3548}, the leprosy{H6883} even rose up{H2224}{(H8804)} in his forehead{H4696} before{H6440} the priests{H3548} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, from beside the incense{H7004} altar{H4196}."

2 Chronicles,26,21,"And Uzziah{H5818} the king{H4428} was a leper{H6879}{(H8794)} unto the day{H3117} of his death{H4194}, and dwelt in{H3427}{(H8799)} a several{H2669}{(H8675)}{H2669} house{H1004}, being a leper{H6879}{(H8794)}; for he was cut off{H1504}{(H8738)} from the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: and Jotham{H3147} his son{H1121} was over the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, judging{H8199}{(H8802)} the people{H5971} of the land{H776}."

And the people{H5971} did yet corruptly{H7843}{(H8688)}."
2 Chronicles,27,3,"He built{H1129}{(H8804)} the high{H5945} gate{H8179} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and on the wall{H2346} of Ophel{H6077} he built{H1129}{(H8804)} much{H7230}."
2 Chronicles,27,4,"Moreover he built{H1129}{(H8804)} cities{H5892} in the mountains{H2022} of Judah{H3063}, and in the forests{H2793} he built{H1129}{(H8804)} castles{H1003} and towers{H4026}."
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He fought{H3898}{(H8738)} also with the king{H4428} of the Ammonites{H5984}, and prevailed{H2388}{(H8799)} against them.

2 Chronicles,28,13,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye shall not bring in{H935}{(H8686)} the captives{H7633} hither: for whereas we have offended{H819} against the LORD{H3068} already, ye intend{H559}{(H8802)} to add{H3254}{(H8687)} more to our sins{H2403} and to our trespass{H819}: for our trespass{H819} is great{H7227}, and there is fierce{H2740} wrath{H639} against Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men{H2502}{(H8803)} left{H5800}{(H8799)} the captives{H7633} and the spoil{H961} before{H6440} the princes{H8269} and all the congregation{H6951}.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"And the men{H582} which were expressed{H5344}{(H8738)} by name{H8034} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and took{H2388}{(H8686)} the captives{H7633}, and with the spoil{H7998} clothed{H3847}{(H8689)} all that were naked{H4636} among them, and arrayed{H3847}{(H8686)} them, and shod{H5274}{(H8686)} them, and gave them to eat{H398}{(H8686)} and to drink{H8248}{(H8686)}, and anointed{H5480}{(H8799)} them, and carried{H5095}{(H8762)} all the feeble{H3782}{(H8802)} of them upon asses{H2543}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them to Jericho{H3405}, the city{H5892} of palm trees{H8558}{(H8677)}{H5899}, to{H681} their brethren{H251}: then they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to Samaria{H8111}."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time{H6256} did king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} send{H7971}{(H8804)} unto the kings{H4428} of Assyria{H804} to help{H5826}{(H8800)} him.
2 Chronicles,28,17,"For again the Edomites{H130} had come{H935}{(H8804)} and smitten{H5221}{(H8686)} Judah{H3063}, and carried away{H7617}{(H8799)} captives{H7628}."
2 Chronicles,28,18,"The Philistines{H6430} also had invaded{H6584}{(H8804)} the cities{H5892} of the low country{H8219}, and of the south{H5045} of Judah{H3063}, and had taken{H3920}{(H8799)} Bethshemesh{H1053}, and Ajalon{H357}, and Gederoth{H1450}, and Shocho{H7755} with the villages{H1323} thereof, and Timnah{H8553} with the villages{H1323} thereof, Gimzo{H1579} also and the villages{H1323} thereof: and they dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} there."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"For the LORD{H3068} brought{H3665} Judah{H3063} low{H3665}{(H8689)} because of Ahaz{H271} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}; for he made{H6544} Judah{H3063} naked{H6544}{(H8689)}, and transgressed{H4603}{(H8800)} sore{H4604} against the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,28,20,"And Tilgathpilneser{H8407} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto him, and distressed{H6696}{(H8799)} him, but strengthened{H2388}{(H8804)} him not."
2 Chronicles,28,21,"For Ahaz{H271} took away a portion{H2505}{(H8804)} out of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and out of the house{H1004} of the king{H4428}, and of the princes{H8269}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}: but he helped{H5833} him not."
2 Chronicles,28,22,And in the time{H6256} of his distress{H6887}{(H8687)} did he trespass{H4603}{(H8800)} yet more{H3254}{(H8686)} against the LORD{H3068}: this is that king{H4428} Ahaz{H271}.
2 Chronicles,28,23,"For he sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} unto the gods{H430} of Damascus{H1834}, which smote{H5221}{(H8688)} him: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Because the gods{H430} of the kings{H4428} of Syria{H758} help{H5826}{(H8688)} them, therefore will I sacrifice{H2076}{(H8762)} to them, that they may help{H5826}{(H8799)} me. But they were the ruin{H3782}{(H8687)} of him, and of all Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,28,24,"And Ahaz{H271} gathered together{H622}{(H8799)} the vessels{H3627} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}, and cut in pieces{H7112}{(H8762)} the vessels{H3627} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}, and shut up{H5462}{(H8799)} the doors{H1817} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and he made{H6213}{(H8799)} him altars{H4196} in every corner{H6438} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"And in every several city{H5892} of Judah{H3063} he made{H6213}{(H8804)} high places{H1116} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto other{H312} gods{H430}, and provoked to anger{H3707}{(H8686)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of his fathers{H1}."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"Now the rest{H3499} of his acts{H1697} and of all his ways{H1870}, first{H7223} and last{H314}, behold, they are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} and Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"And Ahaz{H271} slept{H7901}{(H8799)} with his fathers{H1}, and they buried{H6912}{(H8799)} him in the city{H5892}, even in Jerusalem{H3389}: but they brought{H935}{(H8689)} him not into the sepulchres{H6913} of the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}: and Hezekiah{H3169} his son{H1121} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} in his stead."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah{H3169} began to reign{H4427}{(H8804)} when he was five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} years{H8141} old{H1121}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} nine{H8672} and twenty{H6242} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Abijah{H29}, the daughter{H1323} of Zechariah{H2148}."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was right{H3477} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that David{H1732} his father{H1} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"He in the first{H7223} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, in the first{H7223} month{H2320}, opened{H6605}{(H8804)} the doors{H1817} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and repaired{H2388}{(H8762)} them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,"And he brought in{H935}{(H8686)} the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881}, and gathered them together{H622}{(H8799)} into the east{H4217} street{H7339},"
2 Chronicles,29,5,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} me, ye Levites{H3881}, sanctify{H6942}{(H8690)} now yourselves, and sanctify{H6942}{(H8761)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of your fathers{H1}, and carry forth{H3318}{(H8685)} the filthiness{H5079} out of the holy{H6944} place."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"For our fathers{H1} have trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)}, and done{H6213}{(H8804)} that which was evil{H7451} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, and have forsaken{H5800}{(H8799)} him, and have turned away{H5437}{(H8686)} their faces{H6440} from the habitation{H4908} of the LORD{H3068}, and turned{H5414}{(H8799)} their backs{H6203}."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"Also they have shut up{H5462}{(H8804)} the doors{H1817} of the porch{H197}, and put out{H3518}{(H8762)} the lamps{H5216}, and have not burned{H6999}{(H8689)} incense{H7004} nor offered{H5927}{(H8689)} burnt offerings{H5930} in the holy{H6944} place unto the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"Wherefore the wrath{H7110} of the LORD{H3068} was upon Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, and he hath delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them to trouble{H2189}{(H8675)}{H2113}, to astonishment{H8047}, and to hissing{H8322}, as ye see{H7200}{(H8802)} with your eyes{H5869}."
2 Chronicles,29,9,"For, lo, our fathers{H1} have fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} by the sword{H2719}, and our sons{H1121} and our daughters{H1323} and our wives{H802} are in captivity{H7628} for this."
2 Chronicles,29,10,"Now it is in mine heart{H3824} to make{H3772}{(H8800)} a covenant{H1285} with the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, that his fierce{H2740} wrath{H639} may turn away{H7725}{(H8799)} from us."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons{H1121}, be not now negligent{H7952}{(H8735)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath chosen{H977}{(H8804)} you to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} before{H6440} him, to serve{H8334}{(H8763)} him, and that ye should minister{H8334}{(H8764)} unto him, and burn incense{H6999}{(H8688)}."
2 Chronicles,29,12,"Then the Levites{H3881} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, Mahath{H4287} the son{H1121} of Amasai{H6022}, and Joel{H3100} the son{H1121} of Azariah{H5838}, of the sons{H1121} of the Kohathites{H6956}: and of the sons{H1121} of Merari{H4847}, Kish{H7027} the son{H1121} of Abdi{H5660}, and Azariah{H5838} the son{H1121} of Jehalelel{H3094}: and of the Gershonites{H1649}; Joah{H3098} the son{H1121} of Zimmah{H2155}, and Eden{H5731} the son{H1121} of Joah{H3098}:"
2 Chronicles,29,13,"And of the sons{H1121} of Elizaphan{H469}; Shimri{H8113}, and Jeiel{H3273}: and of the sons{H1121} of Asaph{H623}; Zechariah{H2148}, and Mattaniah{H4983}:"

2 Chronicles,29,15,"And they gathered{H622}{(H8799)} their brethren{H251}, and sanctified{H6942}{(H8691)} themselves, and came{H935}{(H8799)}, according to the commandment{H4687} of the king{H4428}, by the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, to cleanse{H2891}{(H8763)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,29,16,"And the priests{H3548} went{H935}{(H8799)} into the inner part{H6441} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, to cleanse{H2891}{(H8763)} it, and brought out{H3318}{(H8686)} all the uncleanness{H2932} that they found{H4672}{(H8804)} in the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068} into the court{H2691} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}. And the Levites{H3881} took{H6901}{(H8762)} it, to carry it out{H3318}{(H8687)} abroad{H2351} into the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}."
2 Chronicles,29,17,"Now they began{H2490}{(H8686)} on the first{H259} day of the first{H7223} month{H2320} to sanctify{H6942}{(H8763)}, and on the eighth{H8083} day{H3117} of the month{H2320} came{H935}{(H8804)} they to the porch{H197} of the LORD{H3068}: so they sanctified{H6942}{(H8762)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} in eight{H8083} days{H3117}; and in the sixteenth{H8337}{H6240} day of the first{H7223} month{H2320} they made an end{H3615}{(H8765)}."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went{H935}{(H8799)} in{H6441} to Hezekiah{H2396} the king{H4428}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We have cleansed{H2891}{(H8765)} all the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the altar{H4196} of burnt offering{H5930}, with all the vessels{H3627} thereof, and the shewbread{H4635} table{H7979}, with all the vessels{H3627} thereof."
2 Chronicles,29,19,"Moreover all the vessels{H3627}, which king{H4428} Ahaz{H271} in his reign{H4438} did cast away{H2186}{(H8689)} in his transgression{H4604}, have we prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} and sanctified{H6942}{(H8689)}, and, behold, they are before{H6440} the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,29,20,"Then Hezekiah{H3169} the king{H4428} rose early{H7925}{(H8686)}, and gathered{H622}{(H8799)} the rulers{H8269} of the city{H5892}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,29,21,"And they brought{H935}{(H8686)} seven{H7651} bullocks{H6499}, and seven{H7651} rams{H352}, and seven{H7651} lambs{H3532}, and seven{H7651} he{H6842} goats{H5795}, for a sin offering{H2403} for the kingdom{H4467}, and for the sanctuary{H4720}, and for Judah{H3063}. And he commanded{H559}{(H8799)} the priests{H3548} the sons{H1121} of Aaron{H175} to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} them on the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they killed{H7819}{(H8799)} the bullocks{H1241}, and the priests{H3548} received{H6901}{(H8762)} the blood{H1818}, and sprinkled{H2236}{(H8799)} it on the altar{H4196}: likewise, when they had killed{H7819}{(H8799)} the rams{H352}, they sprinkled{H2236}{(H8799)} the blood{H1818} upon the altar{H4196}: they killed{H7819}{(H8799)} also the lambs{H3532}, and they sprinkled{H2236}{(H8799)} the blood{H1818} upon the altar{H4196}."
2 Chronicles,29,23,And they brought forth{H5066}{(H8686)} the he goats{H8163} for the sin offering{H2403} before{H6440} the king{H4428} and the congregation{H6951}; and they laid{H5564}{(H8799)} their hands{H3027} upon them:
2 Chronicles,29,24,"And the priests{H3548} killed{H7819}{(H8799)} them, and they made reconciliation{H2398}{(H8762)} with their blood{H1818} upon the altar{H4196}, to make an atonement{H3722}{(H8763)} for all Israel{H3478}: for the king{H4428} commanded{H559}{(H8804)} that the burnt offering{H5930} and the sin offering{H2403} should be made for all Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"And he set{H5975}{(H8686)} the Levites{H3881} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} with cymbals{H4700}, with psalteries{H5035}, and with harps{H3658}, according to the commandment{H4687} of David{H1732}, and of Gad{H1410} the king's{H4428} seer{H2374}, and Nathan{H5416} the prophet{H5030}: for so was the commandment{H4687} of{H3027} the LORD{H3068} by{H3027} his prophets{H5030}."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"And the Levites{H3881} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} with the instruments{H3627} of David{H1732}, and the priests{H3548} with the trumpets{H2689}."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"And Hezekiah{H2396} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} the burnt offering{H5930} upon the altar{H4196}. And when{H6256} the burnt offering{H5930} began{H2490}{(H8689)}, the song{H7892} of the LORD{H3068} began{H2490}{(H8689)} also with the trumpets{H2689}, and with the instruments{H3627} ordained by{H3027} David{H1732} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"And all the congregation{H6951} worshipped{H7812}{(H8693)}, and the singers{H7892} sang{H7891}{(H8789)}, and the trumpeters{H2689} sounded{H2690}{(H8688)}{(H8675)}{H2690}{(H8764)}: and all this continued until the burnt offering{H5930} was finished{H3615}{(H8800)}."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"And when they had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of offering{H5927}{(H8687)}, the king{H4428} and all that were present{H4672}{(H8737)} with him bowed{H3766}{(H8804)} themselves, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)}."
2 Chronicles,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah{H3169} the king{H4428} and the princes{H8269} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} the Levites{H3881} to sing praise{H1984}{(H8763)} unto the LORD{H3068} with the words{H1697} of David{H1732}, and of Asaph{H623} the seer{H2374}. And they sang praises{H1984}{(H8762)} with gladness{H8057}, and they bowed their heads{H6915}{(H8799)} and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)}."
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah{H3169} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Now ye have consecrated{H4390}{(H8765)}{H3027} yourselves unto the LORD{H3068}, come near{H5066}{(H8798)} and bring{H935}{(H8685)} sacrifices{H2077} and thank offerings{H8426} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}. And the congregation{H6951} brought in{H935}{(H8686)} sacrifices{H2077} and thank offerings{H8426}; and as many as were of a free{H5081} heart{H3820} burnt offerings{H5930}."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"And the number{H4557} of the burnt offerings{H5930}, which the congregation{H6951} brought{H935}{(H8689)}, was threescore and ten{H7657} bullocks{H1241}, an hundred{H3967} rams{H352}, and two hundred{H3967} lambs{H3532}: all these were for a burnt offering{H5930} to the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,29,33,And the consecrated things{H6944} were six{H8337} hundred{H3967} oxen{H1241} and three{H7969} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}.
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But the priests{H3548} were too few{H4592}, so that they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not flay{H6584}{(H8687)} all the burnt offerings{H5930}: wherefore their brethren{H251} the Levites{H3881} did help{H2388}{(H8762)} them, till the work{H4399} was ended{H3615}{(H8800)}, and until the other priests{H3548} had sanctified{H6942}{(H8691)} themselves: for the Levites{H3881} were more upright{H3477} in heart{H3824} to sanctify{H6942}{(H8692)} themselves than the priests{H3548}."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"And also the burnt offerings{H5930} were in abundance{H7230}, with the fat{H2459} of the peace offerings{H8002}, and the drink offerings{H5262} for every burnt offering{H5930}. So the service{H5656} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} was set in order{H3559}{(H8735)}."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"And Hezekiah{H3169} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)}, and all the people{H5971}, that God{H430} had prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} the people{H5971}: for the thing{H1697} was done suddenly{H6597}."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"And Hezekiah{H3169} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to all Israel{H3478} and Judah{H3063}, and wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} letters{H107} also to Ephraim{H669} and Manasseh{H4519}, that they should come{H935}{(H8800)} to the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} at Jerusalem{H3389}, to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} the passover{H6453} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,30,2,"For the king{H4428} had taken counsel{H3289}{(H8735)}, and his princes{H8269}, and all the congregation{H6951} in Jerusalem{H3389}, to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} the passover{H6453} in the second{H8145} month{H2320}."
2 Chronicles,30,3,"For they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not keep{H6213}{(H8800)} it at that time{H6256}, because the priests{H3548} had not sanctified{H6942}{(H8694)} themselves sufficiently{H4078}{(H8676)}{H1767}, neither had the people{H5971} gathered themselves together{H622}{(H8738)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,30,4,And the thing{H1697} pleased{H3474}{(H8799)}{H5869} the king{H4428} and all the congregation{H6951}.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"So they established{H5975}{(H8686)} a decree{H1697} to make proclamation{H5674}{(H8687)}{H6963} throughout all Israel{H3478}, from Beersheba{H884} even to Dan{H1835}, that they should come{H935}{(H8800)} to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} the passover{H6453} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} at Jerusalem{H3389}: for they had not done{H6213}{(H8804)} it of a long{H7230} time in such sort as it was written{H3789}{(H8803)}."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"So the posts{H7323}{(H8801)} went{H3212}{(H8799)} with the letters{H107} from{H3027} the king{H4428} and his princes{H8269} throughout all Israel{H3478} and Judah{H3063}, and according to the commandment{H4687} of the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, turn again{H7725}{(H8798)} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Abraham{H85}, Isaac{H3327}, and Israel{H3478}, and he will return{H7725}{(H8799)} to the remnant{H7604}{(H8737)} of you, that are escaped{H6413} out of the hand{H3709} of the kings{H4428} of Assyria{H804}."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"And be not ye like your fathers{H1}, and like your brethren{H251}, which trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}, who therefore gave them up{H5414}{(H8799)} to desolation{H8047}, as ye see{H7200}{(H8802)}."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked{H7185}{(H8686)}{H6203}, as your fathers{H1} were, but yield{H5414}{(H8798)} yourselves{H3027} unto the LORD{H3068}, and enter{H935}{(H8798)} into his sanctuary{H4720}, which he hath sanctified{H6942}{(H8689)} for ever{H5769}: and serve{H5647}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, that the fierceness{H2740} of his wrath{H639} may turn away{H7725}{(H8799)} from you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"For if ye turn again{H7725}{(H8800)} unto the LORD{H3068}, your brethren{H251} and your children{H1121} shall find compassion{H7356} before{H6440} them that lead them captive{H7617}{(H8802)}, so that they shall come again{H7725}{(H8800)} into this land{H776}: for the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} is gracious{H2587} and merciful{H7349}, and will not turn away{H5493}{(H8686)} his face{H6440} from you, if ye return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto him."
2 Chronicles,30,10,"So the posts{H7323}{(H8801)} passed{H5674}{(H8802)} from city{H5892} to city{H5892} through the country{H776} of Ephraim{H669} and Manasseh{H4519} even unto Zebulun{H2074}: but they laughed them to scorn{H7832}{(H8688)}, and mocked{H3932}{(H8688)} them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"Nevertheless divers{H582} of Asher{H836} and Manasseh{H4519} and of Zebulun{H2074} humbled{H3665}{(H8738)} themselves, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,30,12,"Also in Judah{H3063} the hand{H3027} of God{H430} was to give{H5414}{(H8800)} them one{H259} heart{H3820} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} the commandment{H4687} of the king{H4428} and of the princes{H8269}, by the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,30,13,"And there assembled{H622}{(H8735)} at Jerusalem{H3389} much{H7227} people{H5971} to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} the feast{H2282} of unleavened bread{H4682} in the second{H8145} month{H2320}, a very{H3966} great{H7230} congregation{H6951}."
2 Chronicles,30,14,"And they arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and took away{H5493}{(H8686)} the altars{H4196} that were in Jerusalem{H3389}, and all the altars for incense{H6999} took they away{H5493}{(H8689)}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} them into the brook{H5158} Kidron{H6939}."
2 Chronicles,30,15,"Then they killed{H7819}{(H8799)} the passover{H6453} on the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} day of the second{H8145} month{H2320}: and the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881} were ashamed{H3637}{(H8738)}, and sanctified{H6942}{(H8691)} themselves, and brought in{H935}{(H8686)} the burnt offerings{H5930} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,30,16,"And they stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in their place{H5977} after their manner{H4941}, according to the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872} the man{H376} of God{H430}: the priests{H3548} sprinkled{H2236}{(H8802)} the blood{H1818}, which they received of the hand{H3027} of the Levites{H3881}."
2 Chronicles,30,17,"For there were many{H7227} in the congregation{H6951} that were not sanctified{H6942}{(H8694)}: therefore the Levites{H3881} had the charge of the killing{H7821} of the passovers{H6453} for every one that was not clean{H2889}, to sanctify{H6942}{(H8687)} them unto the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"For a multitude{H4768} of the people{H5971}, even many{H7227} of Ephraim{H669}, and Manasseh{H4519}, Issachar{H3485}, and Zebulun{H2074}, had not{H3808} cleansed{H2891}{(H8694)} themselves, yet did they eat{H398}{(H8804)} the passover{H6453} otherwise than it was written{H3789}{(H8803)}. But Hezekiah{H3169} prayed{H6419}{(H8694)} for them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The good{H2896} LORD{H3068} pardon{H3722}{(H8762)} every one"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"That prepareth{H3559}{(H8689)} his heart{H3824} to seek{H1875}{(H8800)} God{H430}, the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of his fathers{H1}, though he be not cleansed according to the purification{H2893} of the sanctuary{H6944}."
2 Chronicles,30,20,"And the LORD{H3068} hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} to Hezekiah{H3169}, and healed{H7495}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}."
2 Chronicles,30,21,"And the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} that were present{H4672}{(H8737)} at Jerusalem{H3389} kept{H6213}{(H8799)} the feast{H2282} of unleavened bread{H4682} seven{H7651} days{H3117} with great{H1419} gladness{H8057}: and the Levites{H3881} and the priests{H3548} praised{H1984}{(H8764)} the LORD{H3068} day{H3117} by day{H3117}, singing with loud{H5797} instruments{H3627} unto the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"And Hezekiah{H3169} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} comfortably{H3820} unto all the Levites{H3881} that taught{H7919}{(H8688)} the good{H2896} knowledge{H7922} of the LORD{H3068}: and they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} throughout the feast{H4150} seven{H7651} days{H3117}, offering{H2076}{(H8764)} peace{H8002} offerings{H2077}, and making confession{H3034}{(H8693)} to the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of their fathers{H1}."
2 Chronicles,30,23,And the whole assembly{H6951} took counsel{H3289}{(H8735)} to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} other{H312} seven{H7651} days{H3117}: and they kept{H6213}{(H8799)} other seven{H7651} days{H3117} with gladness{H8057}.
2 Chronicles,30,24,For Hezekiah{H2396} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} did give{H7311}{(H8689)} to the congregation{H6951} a thousand{H505} bullocks{H6499} and seven{H7651} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}; and the princes{H8269} gave{H7311}{(H8689)} to the congregation{H6951} a thousand{H505} bullocks{H6499} and ten{H6235} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}: and a great number{H7230} of priests{H3548} sanctified{H6942}{(H8691)} themselves.
2 Chronicles,30,25,"And all the congregation{H6951} of Judah{H3063}, with the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881}, and all the congregation{H6951} that came out{H935}{(H8802)} of Israel{H3478}, and the strangers{H1616} that came out{H935}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}, and that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Judah{H3063}, rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)}."
2 Chronicles,30,26,So there was great{H1419} joy{H8057} in Jerusalem{H3389}: for since the time{H3117} of Solomon{H8010} the son{H1121} of David{H1732} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} there was not the like in Jerusalem{H3389}.
2 Chronicles,30,27,"Then the priests{H3548} the Levites{H3881} arose{H6965}{(H8799)} and blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} the people{H5971}: and their voice{H6963} was heard{H8085}{(H8735)}, and their prayer{H8605} came{H935}{(H8799)} up to his holy{H6944} dwelling place{H4583}, even unto heaven{H8064}."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"Now when all this was finished{H3615}{(H8763)}, all Israel{H3478} that were present{H4672}{(H8737)} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} to the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and brake{H7665} the images{H4676} in pieces{H7665}{(H8762)}, and cut down{H1438}{(H8762)} the groves{H842}, and threw down{H5422}{(H8762)} the high places{H1116} and the altars{H4196} out of all Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144}, in Ephraim{H669} also and Manasseh{H4519}, until they had utterly destroyed{H3615}{(H8763)} them all. Then all the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, every man{H376} to his possession{H272}, into their own cities{H5892}."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"And Hezekiah{H3169} appointed{H5975}{(H8686)} the courses{H4256} of the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881} after their courses{H4256}, every man{H376} according{H6310} to his service{H5656}, the priests{H3548} and Levites{H3881} for burnt offerings{H5930} and for peace offerings{H8002}, to minister{H8334}{(H8763)}, and to give thanks{H3034}{(H8687)}, and to praise{H1984}{(H8763)} in the gates{H8179} of the tents{H4264} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"He appointed also the king's{H4428} portion{H4521} of his substance{H7399} for the burnt offerings{H5930}, to wit, for the morning{H1242} and evening{H6153} burnt offerings{H5930}, and the burnt offerings{H5930} for the sabbaths{H7676}, and for the new moons{H2320}, and for the set feasts{H4150}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,31,4,"Moreover he commanded{H559}{(H8799)} the people{H5971} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in Jerusalem{H3389} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} the portion{H4521} of the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881}, that they might be encouraged{H2388}{(H8799)} in the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068}."
2 Chronicles,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment{H1697} came abroad{H6555}{(H8800)}, the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} brought{H935}{(H8689)} in abundance{H7235}{(H8689)} the firstfruits{H7225} of corn{H1715}, wine{H8492}, and oil{H3323}, and honey{H1706}, and of all the increase{H8393} of the field{H7704}; and the tithe{H4643} of all things brought{H935}{(H8689)} they in abundantly{H7230}."

2 Chronicles,31,7,"In the third{H7992} month{H2320} they began{H2490}{(H8689)} to lay the foundation{H3245}{(H8800)} of the heaps{H6194}, and finished{H3615}{(H8765)} them in the seventh{H7637} month{H2320}."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"And when Hezekiah{H3169} and the princes{H8269} came{H935}{(H8799)} and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} the heaps{H6194}, they blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} the LORD{H3068}, and his people{H5971} Israel{H3478}."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Then Hezekiah{H3169} questioned{H1875}{(H8799)} with the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881} concerning the heaps{H6194}.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"And Azariah{H5838} the chief{H7218} priest{H3548} of the house{H1004} of Zadok{H6659} answered{H559}{(H8799)} him, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Since the people began{H2490}{(H8687)} to bring{H935}{(H8687)} the offerings{H8641} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, we have had enough{H7646}{(H8800)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}, and have left{H3498}{(H8687)} plenty{H7230}: for the LORD{H3068} hath blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} his people{H5971}; and that which is left{H3498}{(H8737)} is this great store{H1995}."

2 Chronicles,32,5,"Also he strengthened{H2388}{(H8691)} himself, and built up{H1129}{(H8799)} all the wall{H2346} that was broken{H6555}{(H8803)}, and raised it up{H5927}{(H8686)} to the towers{H4026}, and another{H312} wall{H2346} without{H2351}, and repaired{H2388}{(H8762)} Millo{H4407} in the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} darts{H7973} and shields{H4043} in abundance{H7230}."
2 Chronicles,32,6,"And he set{H5414}{(H8799)} captains{H8269} of war{H4421} over the people{H5971}, and gathered them together{H6908}{(H8799)} to him in the street{H7339} of the gate{H8179} of the city{H5892}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} comfortably{H3824} to them, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Chronicles,32,7,"Be strong{H2388}{(H8798)} and courageous{H553}{(H8798)}, be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} nor dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)} for{H6440} the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, nor for all the multitude{H1995} that is with him: for there be more{H7227} with us than with him:"
2 Chronicles,32,8,"With him is an arm{H2220} of flesh{H1320}; but with us is the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} to help{H5826}{(H8800)} us, and to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} our battles{H4421}. And the people{H5971} rested{H5564}{(H8735)} themselves upon the words{H1697} of Hezekiah{H3169} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}."
2 Chronicles,32,9,"After{H310} this did Sennacherib{H5576} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804} send{H7971}{(H8804)} his servants{H5650} to Jerusalem{H3389},(but he himself laid siege against Lachish{H3923}, and all his power{H4475} with him,) unto Hezekiah{H3169} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and unto all Judah{H3063} that were at Jerusalem{H3389}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
2 Chronicles,32,10,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} Sennacherib{H5576} king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, Whereon do ye trust{H982}{(H8802)}, that ye abide{H3427}{(H8802)} in the siege{H4692} in Jerusalem{H3389}?"
2 Chronicles,32,11,"Doth not Hezekiah{H3169} persuade{H5496}{(H8688)} you to give{H5414}{(H8800)} over yourselves to die{H4191}{(H8800)} by famine{H7458} and by thirst{H6772}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The LORD{H3068} our God{H430} shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} us out of the hand{H3709} of the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}?"
2 Chronicles,32,12,"Hath not the same Hezekiah{H3169} taken away{H5493}{(H8689)} his high places{H1116} and his altars{H4196}, and commanded{H559}{(H8799)} Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye shall worship{H7812}{(H8691)} before{H6440} one{H259} altar{H4196}, and burn incense{H6999}{(H8686)} upon it?"

2 Chronicles,32,14,"Who was there among all the gods{H430} of those nations{H1471} that my fathers{H1} utterly destroyed{H2763}{(H8689)}, that could{H3201}{(H8804)} deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} his people{H5971} out of mine hand{H3027}, that your God{H430} should be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} you out of mine hand{H3027}?"
2 Chronicles,32,15,"Now therefore let not{H3808} Hezekiah{H2396} deceive{H5377}{(H8686)} you, nor persuade{H5496}{(H8686)} you on this manner, neither yet believe{H539}{(H8686)} him: for no god{H433} of any nation{H1471} or kingdom{H4467} was able{H3201}{(H8799)} to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} his people{H5971} out of mine hand{H3027}, and out of the hand{H3027} of my fathers{H1}: how much less shall your God{H430} deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} you out of mine hand{H3027}?"
2 Chronicles,32,16,"And his servants{H5650} spake{H1696}{(H8765)} yet more against the LORD{H3068} God{H430}, and against his servant{H5650} Hezekiah{H3169}."
2 Chronicles,32,17,"He wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} also letters{H5612} to rail{H2778}{(H8763)} on the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, and to speak{H559}{(H8800)} against him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, As the gods{H430} of the nations{H1471} of other lands{H776} have not delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} their people{H5971} out of mine hand{H3027}, so shall not the God{H430} of Hezekiah{H3169} deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} his people{H5971} out of mine hand{H3027}."
2 Chronicles,32,18,"Then they cried{H7121}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963} in the Jews' speech{H3066} unto the people{H5971} of Jerusalem{H3389} that were on the wall{H2346}, to affright{H3372}{(H8763)} them, and to trouble{H926}{(H8763)} them; that they might take{H3920}{(H8799)} the city{H5892}."
2 Chronicles,32,19,"And they spake{H1696}{(H8762)} against{H5921} the God{H430} of Jerusalem{H3389}, as against the gods{H430} of the people{H5971} of the earth{H776}, which were the work{H4639} of the hands{H3027} of man{H120}."
2 Chronicles,32,20,"And for this cause Hezekiah{H3169} the king{H4428}, and the prophet{H5030} Isaiah{H3470} the son{H1121} of Amoz{H531}, prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} and cried{H2199}{(H8799)} to heaven{H8064}."
2 Chronicles,32,21,"And the LORD{H3068} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} an angel{H4397}, which cut off{H3582}{(H8686)} all the mighty men{H1368} of valour{H2428}, and the leaders{H5057} and captains{H8269} in the camp{H4264} of the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}. So he returned{H7725}{(H8799)} with shame{H1322} of face{H6440} to his own land{H776}. And when he was come{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of his god{H430}, they that came forth{H3329} of his own bowels{H4578} slew{H5307}{(H8689)} him there with the sword{H2719}."
2 Chronicles,32,22,"Thus the LORD{H3068} saved{H3467}{(H8686)} Hezekiah{H3169} and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} from the hand{H3027} of Sennacherib{H5576} the king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}, and from the hand{H3027} of all other, and guided{H5095}{(H8762)} them on every side{H5439}."
2 Chronicles,32,23,"And many{H7227} brought{H935}{(H8688)} gifts{H4503} unto the LORD{H3068} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and presents{H4030} to Hezekiah{H3169} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}: so that he was magnified{H5375}{(H8735)} in the sight{H5869} of all nations{H1471} from thenceforth{H310}."
2 Chronicles,32,24,"In those days{H3117} Hezekiah{H3169} was sick{H2470}{(H8804)} to the death{H4191}{(H8800)}, and prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068}: and he spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, and he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} him a sign{H4159}."
2 Chronicles,32,25,"But Hezekiah{H3169} rendered not again{H7725}{(H8689)} according to the benefit{H1576} done unto him; for his heart{H3820} was lifted up{H1361}{(H8804)}: therefore there was wrath{H7110} upon him, and upon Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,32,26,"Notwithstanding Hezekiah{H3169} humbled{H3665}{(H8735)} himself for the pride{H1363} of his heart{H3820}, both he and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, so that the wrath{H7110} of the LORD{H3068} came{H935}{(H8804)} not upon them in the days{H3117} of Hezekiah{H3169}."
2 Chronicles,32,27,"And Hezekiah{H3169} had exceeding{H3966} much{H7235}{(H8687)} riches{H6239} and honour{H3519}: and he made{H6213}{(H8804)} himself treasuries{H214} for silver{H3701}, and for gold{H2091}, and for precious{H3368} stones{H68}, and for spices{H1314}, and for shields{H4043}, and for all manner of pleasant{H2532} jewels{H3627};"
2 Chronicles,32,28,"Storehouses{H4543} also for the increase{H8393} of corn{H1715}, and wine{H8492}, and oil{H3323}; and stalls{H723} for all manner of beasts{H929}, and cotes{H220} for flocks{H5739}."
2 Chronicles,32,29,"Moreover he provided{H6213}{(H8804)} him cities{H5892}, and possessions{H4735} of flocks{H6629} and herds{H1241} in abundance{H7230}: for God{H430} had given{H5414}{(H8804)} him substance{H7399} very{H3966} much{H7227}."
2 Chronicles,32,30,"This same Hezekiah{H3169} also stopped{H5640}{(H8804)} the upper{H5945} watercourse{H4161}{H4325} of Gihon{H1521}, and brought it straight{H3474}{(H8762)} down{H4295} to the west side{H4628} of the city{H5892} of David{H1732}. And Hezekiah{H3169} prospered{H6743}{(H8686)} in all his works{H4639}."
2 Chronicles,32,31,"Howbeit{H3651} in the business of the ambassadors{H3887}{(H8688)} of the princes{H8269} of Babylon{H894}, who sent{H7971}{(H8764)} unto him to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of the wonder{H4159} that was done in the land{H776}, God{H430} left{H5800}{(H8804)} him, to try{H5254}{(H8763)} him, that he might know{H3045}{(H8800)} all that was in his heart{H3824}."
2 Chronicles,32,32,"Now the rest{H3499} of the acts{H1697} of Hezekiah{H3169}, and his goodness{H2617}, behold, they are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the vision{H2377} of Isaiah{H3470} the prophet{H5030}, the son{H1121} of Amoz{H531}, and in the book{H5612} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} and Israel{H3478}."

2 Chronicles,35,11,"And they killed{H7819}{(H8799)} the passover{H6453}, and the priests{H3548} sprinkled{H2236}{(H8799)} the blood from their hands{H3027}, and the Levites{H3881} flayed{H6584}{(H8688)} them."
2 Chronicles,35,12,"And they removed{H5493}{(H8686)} the burnt offerings{H5930}, that they might give{H5414}{(H8800)} according to the divisions{H4653} of the families{H1}{H1004} of the people{H1121}{H5971}, to offer{H7126}{(H8687)} unto the LORD{H3068}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of Moses{H4872}.

2 Chronicles,35,13,"And they roasted{H1310}{(H8762)} the passover{H6453} with fire{H784} according to the ordinance{H4941}: but the other holy{H6944} offerings sod{H1310}{(H8765)} they in pots{H5518}, and in caldrons{H1731}, and in pans{H6745}, and divided them speedily{H7323}{(H8686)} among all the people{H1121}{H5971}."
2 Chronicles,35,14,"And afterward{H310} they made ready{H3559}{(H8689)} for themselves, and for the priests{H3548}: because the priests{H3548} the sons{H1121} of Aaron{H175} were busied in offering{H5927}{(H8687)} of burnt offerings{H5930} and the fat{H2459} until night{H3915}; therefore the Levites{H3881} prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} for themselves, and for the priests{H3548} the sons{H1121} of Aaron{H175}."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"And the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} the sons{H1121} of Asaph{H623} were in their place{H4612}, according to the commandment{H4687} of David{H1732}, and Asaph{H623}, and Heman{H1968}, and Jeduthun{H3038} the king's{H4428} seer{H2374}; and the porters{H7778} waited at every gate{H8179}; they might not depart{H5493}{(H8800)} from their service{H5656}; for their brethren{H251} the Levites{H3881} prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} for them."
2 Chronicles,35,16,"So all the service{H5656} of the LORD{H3068} was prepared{H3559}{(H8735)} the same day{H3117}, to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} the passover{H6453}, and to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} burnt offerings{H5930} upon the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068}, according to the commandment{H4687} of king{H4428} Josiah{H2977}."

2 Chronicles,35,18,"And there was no passover{H6453} like{H3644} to that kept{H6213}{(H8738)} in Israel{H3478} from the days{H3117} of Samuel{H8050} the prophet{H5030}; neither did{H6213}{(H8804)} all the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478} keep{H6213}{(H8804)} such a passover{H6453} as Josiah{H2977} kept{H6213}{(H8804)}, and the priests{H3548}, and the Levites{H3881}, and all Judah{H3063} and Israel{H3478} that were present{H4672}{(H8737)}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
2 Chronicles,35,19,In the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of Josiah{H2977} was this passover{H6453} kept{H6213}{(H8738)}.
2 Chronicles,35,20,"After{H310} all this, when Josiah{H2977} had prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} the temple{H1004}, Necho{H5224} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against Carchemish{H3751} by Euphrates{H6578}: and Josiah{H2977} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} against{H7125}{(H8800)} him."

I come not against thee this day{H3117}, but against the house{H1004} wherewith I have war{H4421}: for God{H430} commanded{H559}{(H8804)} me to make haste{H926}{(H8763)}: forbear{H2308}{(H8798)} thee from meddling with God{H430}, who is with me, that he destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} thee not."
2 Chronicles,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah{H2977} would not turn{H5437}{(H8689)} his face{H6440} from him, but disguised{H2664}{(H8694)} himself, that he might fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with him, and hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto the words{H1697} of Necho{H5224} from the mouth{H6310} of God{H430}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} in the valley{H1237} of Megiddo{H4023}."
2 Chronicles,35,23,"And the archers{H3384}{(H8802)} shot{H3384}{(H8686)} at king{H4428} Josiah{H2977}; and the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} to his servants{H5650}, Have me away{H5674}{(H8685)}; for I am sore{H3966} wounded{H2470}{(H8717)}."
2 Chronicles,35,24,"His servants{H5650} therefore took{H5674}{(H8686)} him out of that chariot{H4818}, and put{H7392}{(H8686)} him in the second{H4932} chariot{H7393} that he had; and they brought{H3212}{(H8686)} him to Jerusalem{H3389}, and he died{H4191}{(H8799)}, and was buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in one of the sepulchres{H6913} of his fathers{H1}.

2 Chronicles,35,25,"And Jeremiah{H3414} lamented{H6969}{(H8787)} for Josiah{H2977}: and all the singing men{H7891}{(H8802)} and the singing women{H7891}{(H8802)} spake{H559}{(H8799)} of Josiah{H2977} in their lamentations{H7015} to this day{H3117}, and made{H5414}{(H8799)} them an ordinance{H2706} in Israel{H3478}: and, behold, they are written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the lamentations{H7015}."

Ezra,3,13,"So that the people{H5971} could not discern{H5234}{(H8688)} the noise{H6963} of the shout{H8643} of joy{H8057} from the noise{H6963} of the weeping{H1065} of the people{H5971}: for the people{H5971} shouted{H7321}{(H8688)} with a loud{H1419} shout{H8643}, and the noise{H6963} was heard{H8085}{(H8738)} afar off{H7350}."
Ezra,4,1,Now when the adversaries{H6862} of Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that the children{H1121} of the captivity{H1473} builded{H1129}{(H8802)} the temple{H1964} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478};
Ezra,4,2,"Then they came{H5066}{(H8799)} to Zerubbabel{H2216}, and to the chief{H7218} of the fathers{H1}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Let us build{H1129}{(H8799)} with you: for we seek{H1875}{(H8799)} your God{H430}, as ye do; and we do sacrifice{H2076}{(H8802)} unto him since the days{H3117} of Esarhaddon{H634} king{H4428} of Assur{H804}, which brought us up hither{H5927}{(H8688)}."
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel{H2216}, and Jeshua{H3442}, and the rest{H7605} of the chief{H7218} of the fathers{H1} of Israel{H3478}, said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build{H1129}{(H8800)} an house{H1004} unto our God{H430}; but we ourselves together{H3162} will build{H1129}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, as king{H4428} Cyrus{H3566} the king{H4428} of Persia{H6539} hath commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} us."
Ezra,4,4,"Then the people{H5971} of the land{H776} weakened{H7503}{(H8764)} the hands{H3027} of the people{H5971} of Judah{H3063}, and troubled{H926}{(H8764)}{(H8675)}{H1089}{(H8764)} them in building{H1129}{(H8800)},"
Ezra,4,5,"And hired{H7936}{(H8802)} counsellors{H3289}{(H8802)} against them, to frustrate{H6565}{(H8687)} their purpose{H6098}, all the days{H3117} of Cyrus{H3566} king{H4428} of Persia{H6539}, even until the reign{H4438} of Darius{H1867} king{H4428} of Persia{H6539}."
Ezra,4,6,"And in the reign{H4438} of Ahasuerus{H325}, in the beginning{H8462} of his reign{H4438}, wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} they unto him an accusation{H7855} against the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}."
Ezra,4,7,"And in the days{H3117} of Artaxerxes{H783} wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} Bishlam{H1312}, Mithredath{H4990}, Tabeel{H2870}, and the rest{H7605} of their companions{H3674}, unto Artaxerxes{H783} king{H4428} of Persia{H6539}; and the writing{H3791} of the letter{H5406} was written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the Syrian tongue{H762}, and interpreted{H8638}{(H8794)} in the Syrian tongue{H762}."
Ezra,4,8,Rehum{H7348} the chancellor{H1169}{H2942} and Shimshai{H8124} the scribe{H5613} wrote{H3790}{(H8754)} a{H2298} letter{H104} against{H5922} Jerusalem{H3390} to Artaxerxes{H783} the king{H4430} in this sort{H3660}:
Ezra,4,9,"Then{H116} wrote Rehum{H7348} the chancellor{H1169}{H2942}, and Shimshai{H8124} the scribe{H5613}, and the rest{H7606} of their companions{H3675}; the Dinaites{H1784}, the Apharsathchites{H671}, the Tarpelites{H2967}, the Apharsites{H670}, the Archevites{H756}, the Babylonians{H896}, the Susanchites{H7801}, the Dehavites{H1723}, and the Elamites{H5962},"
Ezra,4,10,"And the rest{H7606} of the nations{H524} whom{H1768} the great{H7229} and noble{H3358} Asnappar{H620} brought over{H1541}{(H8684)}, and set{H3488}{(H8684)}{H1994} in the cities{H7149} of Samaria{H8115}, and the rest{H7606} that are on this side{H5675} the river{H5103}, and at such a time{H3706}."
Ezra,4,11,"This{H1836} is the copy{H6573} of the letter{H104} that{H1768} they sent{H7972}{(H8754)} unto him{H5922}, even unto Artaxerxes{H783} the king{H4430}; Thy servants{H5649} the men{H606} on this side{H5675} the river{H5103}, and at such a time{H3706}."
Ezra,4,12,"Be it{H1934}{(H8748)} known{H3046}{(H8752)} unto the king{H4430}, that the Jews{H3062} which{H1768} came up{H5559}{(H8760)} from{H4481} thee{H3890} to us{H5922} are come{H858}{(H8754)} unto Jerusalem{H3390}, building{H1124}{(H8750)} the rebellious{H4779} and the bad{H873} city{H7149}, and have set up{H3635}{(H8806)}{(H8675)}{H3635}{(H8720)} the walls{H7792} thereof, and joined{H2338}{(H8681)} the foundations{H787}."
Ezra,4,13,"Be it known{H3046}{(H8752)}{H1934}{(H8748)} now{H3705} unto the king{H4430}, that, if{H2006} this{H1791} city{H7149} be builded{H1124}{(H8731)}, and the walls{H7792} set up{H3635}{(H8720)} again, then will they not{H3809} pay{H5415}{(H8748)} toll{H4061}, tribute{H1093}, and custom{H1983}, and so thou shalt endamage{H5142}{(H8681)} the revenue{H674} of the kings{H4430}."
Ezra,4,14,"Now{H3705} because{H6903}{H3606} we have{H1768} maintenance{H4415}{(H8754)}{H4416} from the king's palace{H1965}, and it was not{H3809} meet{H749}{(H8750)} for us to see{H2370}{(H8749)} the king's{H4430} dishonour{H6173}, therefore{H5922}{H1836} have we sent{H7972}{(H8754)} and certified{H3046}{(H8684)} the king{H4430};"
Ezra,4,15,"That search{H1240}{(H8741)} may be made in the book{H5609} of the records{H1799} of thy fathers{H2}: so shalt thou find{H7912}{(H8681)} in the book{H5609} of the records{H1799}, and know{H3046}{(H8748)} that this{H1791} city{H7149} is a rebellious{H4779} city{H7149}, and hurtful{H5142}{(H8683)} unto kings{H4430} and provinces{H4083}, and that they have moved{H5648}{(H8751)} sedition{H849} within the same{H1459} of{H4481} old{H5957} time{H3118}: for{H5922} which{H1836} cause was this{H1791} city{H7149} destroyed{H2718}{(H8717)}."
Ezra,4,16,"We{H586} certify{H3046}{(H8683)} the king{H4430} that, if{H2006} this{H1791} city{H7149} be builded{H1124}{(H8731)} again, and the walls{H7792} thereof set up{H3635}{(H8720)}, by this{H1836} means{H6903} thou shalt have{H383} no{H3809} portion{H2508} on this side{H5675} the river{H5103}."
Ezra,4,17,"Then sent{H7972}{(H8754)} the king{H4430} an answer{H6600} unto{H5922} Rehum{H7348} the chancellor{H1169}{H2942}, and to Shimshai{H8124} the scribe{H5613}, and to the rest{H7606} of their companions{H3675} that dwell{H3488}{(H8750)} in Samaria{H8115}, and unto the rest{H7606} beyond{H5675} the river{H5103}, Peace{H8001}, and at such a time{H3706}."
Ezra,4,18,The letter{H5407} which ye sent{H7972}{(H8754)} unto us{H5922} hath been plainly{H6568}{(H8744)} read{H7123}{(H8752)} before{H6925} me.
Ezra,4,19,"And I{H4481} commanded{H7761}{(H8752)}{H2942}, and search{H1240}{(H8745)} hath been made, and it is found{H7912}{(H8684)} that this{H1791} city{H7149} of{H4481} old{H5957} time{H3118} hath made insurrection{H5376}{(H8723)} against{H5922} kings{H4430}, and that rebellion{H4776} and sedition{H849} have been made{H5648}{(H8727)} therein."
Ezra,4,20,"There have been{H1934}{(H8754)} mighty{H8624} kings{H4430} also over{H5922} Jerusalem{H3390}, which have ruled{H7990} over all{H3606} countries beyond{H5675} the river{H5103}; and toll{H4061}, tribute{H1093}, and custom{H1983}, was paid{H3052}{(H8727)} unto them."
Ezra,4,21,"Give{H7761}{(H8747)} ye now{H3705} commandment{H2942} to cause{H989} these{H479} men{H1400} to cease{H989}{(H8749)}, and that this{H1791} city{H7149} be not{H3809} builded{H1124}{(H8731)}, until{H5705} another commandment{H2941} shall be given{H7761}{(H8725)} from me{H4481}."
Ezra,4,22,Take heed{H1934}{(H8747)}{H2095}{(H8750)} now that ye fail{H7960} not to do{H5922}{H5648}{(H8749)} this{H1836}: why{H4101} should damage{H2257} grow{H7680}{(H8748)} to the hurt{H5142}{(H8682)} of the kings{H4430}?
Ezra,4,23,"Now{H116} when{H4481}{H1768} the copy{H6573} of king{H4430} Artaxerxes{H783}' letter{H5407} was read{H7123}{(H8752)} before{H6925} Rehum{H7348}, and Shimshai{H8124} the scribe{H5613}, and their companions{H3675}, they went up{H236}{(H8754)} in haste{H924} to Jerusalem{H3390} unto{H5922} the Jews{H3062}, and made them{H1994} to cease{H989}{(H8754)} by force{H153} and power{H2429}."
Ezra,4,24,Then{H116} ceased{H989}{(H8754)} the work{H5673} of the house{H1005} of God{H426} which is at Jerusalem{H3390}. So it ceased{H1934}{(H8754)}{H989}{(H8750)} unto{H5705} the second{H8648} year{H8140} of the reign{H4437} of Darius{H1868} king{H4430} of Persia{H6540}.
Ezra,5,1,"Then the prophets{H5029}, Haggai{H2292} the prophet{H5029}, and Zechariah{H2148} the son{H1247} of Iddo{H5714}, prophesied{H5013}{(H8724)} unto{H5922} the Jews{H3062} that were in Judah{H3061} and Jerusalem{H3390} in the name{H8036} of the God{H426} of Israel{H3479}, even unto{H5922} them."
Ezra,5,2,"Then{H116} rose up{H6966}{(H8754)} Zerubbabel{H2217} the son{H1247} of Shealtiel{H7598}, and Jeshua{H3443} the son{H1247} of Jozadak{H3136}, and began{H8271}{(H8745)} to build{H1124}{(H8749)} the house{H1005} of God{H426} which is at Jerusalem{H3390}: and with them{H5974} were the prophets{H5029} of God{H426} helping{H5583}{(H8683)} them."
Ezra,5,3,"At the same time{H2166} came{H858}{(H8754)} to them Tatnai{(H8674)}, governor{H6347} on this side{H5675} the river{H5103}, and Shetharboznai{H8370}, and their companions{H3675}, and said{H560}{(H8750)} thus{H3652} unto them{H5922}, Who{H4479} hath commanded{H7761}{(H8754)}{H2942} you to build{H1124}{(H8749)} this{H1836} house{H1005}, and to make up{H3635}{(H8805)} this{H1836} wall{H846}?"
Ezra,5,4,"Then{H116} said{H560}{(H8754)} we unto them after this manner{H3660}, What{H4479} are{H581} the names{H8036} of the men{H1400} that make{H1124}{(H8750)} this{H1836} building{H1147}?"
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye{H5870} of their God{H426} was{H1934}{(H8754)} upon{H5922} the elders{H7868}{(H8750)} of the Jews{H3062}, that they could not{H3809} cause{H989} them{H1994} to cease{H989}{(H8754)}, till{H5705} the matter{H2941} came{H1946}{(H8748)} to Darius{H1868}: and then{H116} they returned answer{H8421}{(H8681)} by letter{H5407} concerning{H5922} this{H1836} matter."
Ezra,5,6,"The copy{H6573} of the letter{H104} that Tatnai{(H8674)}, governor{H6347} on this side{H5675} the river{H5103}, and Shetharboznai{H8370}, and his companions{H3675} the Apharsachites{H671}, which were on this side{H5675} the river{H5103}, sent{H7972}{(H8754)} unto{H5922} Darius{H1868} the king{H4430}:"
Ezra,5,7,"They sent{H7972}{(H8754)} a letter{H6600} unto{H5922} him, wherein{H1459} was written{H3790}{(H8752)} thus{H1836}; Unto Darius{H1868} the king{H4430}, all{H3606} peace{H8001}."
Ezra,5,8,"Be it known{H1934}{(H8748)}{H3046}{(H8752)} unto the king{H4430}, that we went{H236}{(H8754)} into the province{H4083} of Judea{H3061}, to the house{H1005} of the great{H7229} God{H426}, which is builded{H1124}{(H8732)} with great{H1560} stones{H69}, and timber{H636} is laid{H7761}{(H8727)} in the walls{H3797}, and this{H1791} work{H5673} goeth{H5648}{(H8727)} fast{H629} on, and prospereth{H6744}{(H8683)} in their hands{H3028}."
Ezra,5,9,"Then{H116} asked{H7593}{(H8754)} we those{H479} elders{H7868}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8754)} unto them thus{H3660}, Who{H4479} commanded{H7761}{(H8754)}{H2942} you to build{H1124}{(H8749)} this{H1836} house{H1005}, and to make up{H3635}{(H8805)} these{H1836} walls{H846}?"
Ezra,5,10,"We asked{H7593}{(H8754)} their names{H8036} also{H638}, to certify{H3046}{(H8682)} thee, that we might write{H3790}{(H8748)} the names{H8036} of the men{H1400} that were the chief{H7217} of them."
Ezra,5,11,"And thus{H3660} they returned{H8421}{(H8684)} us answer{H6600}, saying{H560}{(H8749)}, We{H586} are{H1994} the servants{H5649} of the God{H426} of heaven{H8065} and earth{H772}, and build{H1124}{(H8750)} the house{H1005} that was{H1934}{(H8754)} builded{H1124}{(H8752)} these{H1836} many{H7690} years{H8140} ago{H6928}, which a great{H7229} king{H4430} of Israel{H3479} builded{H1124}{(H8754)} and set up{H3635}{(H8806)}."
Ezra,5,12,"But{H3861} after{H4481} that our fathers{H2} had provoked{H7265} the God{H426} of heaven{H8065} unto wrath{H7265}{(H8684)}, he gave{H3052}{(H8754)} them{H1994} into the hand{H3028} of Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} of Babylon{H895}, the Chaldean{H3679}, who destroyed{H5642}{(H8754)} this{H1836} house{H1005}, and carried{H1541} the people{H5972} away{H1541}{(H8684)} into Babylon{H895}."
Ezra,5,13,But{H1297} in the first{H2298} year{H8140} of Cyrus{H3567} the king{H4430} of Babylon{H895} the same king{H4430} Cyrus{H3567} made{H7761}{(H8754)} a decree{H2942} to build{H1124}{(H8749)} this{H1836} house{H1005} of God{H426}.
Ezra,5,14,"And the vessels{H3984} also{H638} of{H1768} gold{H1722} and silver{H3702} of the house{H1005} of God{H426}, which Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} took{H5312}{(H8684)} out of{H4481} the temple{H1965} that was in Jerusalem{H3390}, and brought{H2987}{(H8684)} them into the temple{H1965} of Babylon{H895}, those{H1994} did Cyrus{H3567} the king{H4430} take{H5312}{(H8684)} out of{H4481} the temple{H1965} of Babylon{H895}, and they were delivered{H3052}{(H8753)} unto one, whose name{H8036} was Sheshbazzar{H8340}, whom he had made{H7761}{(H8754)} governor{H6347};"
Ezra,5,15,"And said{H560}{(H8754)} unto him, Take{H5376}{(H8747)} these{H412} vessels{H3984}, go{H236}{(H8747)}, carry{H5182}{(H8680)} them{H1994} into the temple{H1965} that is in Jerusalem{H3390}, and let the house{H1005} of God{H426} be builded{H1124}{(H8731)} in{H5922} his place{H870}."
Ezra,5,16,"Then{H116} came{H858}{(H8754)} the same{H1791} Sheshbazzar{H8340}, and laid{H3052}{(H8754)} the foundation{H787} of the house{H1005} of God{H426} which is in Jerusalem{H3390}: and since{H4481} that time{H116} even until{H5705} now{H3705} hath it been in building{H1124}{(H8732)}, and yet it is not{H3809} finished{H8000}{(H8752)}."
Ezra,5,17,"Now{H3705} therefore, if{H2006} it seem good{H2869} to{H5922} the king{H4430}, let there be search{H1240}{(H8721)} made in the king's{H4430} treasure{H1596} house{H1005}, which is there{H8536} at Babylon{H895}, whether{H2006} it be{H383} so, that a decree{H2942} was made{H7761}{(H8752)} of{H4481} Cyrus{H3567} the king{H4430} to build{H1124}{(H8749)} this{H1791} house{H1005} of God{H426} at Jerusalem{H3390}, and let the king{H4430} send{H7972}{(H8748)} his pleasure{H7470} to us concerning{H5922} this matter{H1836}."
Ezra,6,1,"Then{H116} Darius{H1868} the king{H4430} made{H7761}{(H8754)} a decree{H2942}, and search{H1240}{(H8745)} was made in the house{H1005} of the rolls{H5609}, where{H8536} the treasures{H1596} were laid up{H5182}{(H8683)} in Babylon{H895}."

Ezra,8,15,"And I gathered them together{H6908}{(H8799)} to the river{H5104} that runneth{H935}{(H8802)} to Ahava{H163}; and there abode we in tents{H2583}{(H8799)} three{H7969} days{H3117}: and I viewed{H995}{(H8799)} the people{H5971}, and the priests{H3548}, and found{H4672}{(H8804)} there none of the sons{H1121} of Levi{H3878}."
Ezra,8,16,"Then sent{H7971}{(H8799)} I for Eliezer{H461}, for Ariel{H740}, for Shemaiah{H8098}, and for Elnathan{H494}, and for Jarib{H3402}, and for Elnathan{H494}, and for Nathan{H5416}, and for Zechariah{H2148}, and for Meshullam{H4918}, chief men{H7218}; also for Joiarib{H3114}, and for Elnathan{H494}, men of understanding{H995}{(H8688)}."

Ezra,8,18,"And by the good{H2896} hand{H3027} of our God{H430} upon us they brought{H935}{(H8686)} us a man{H376} of understanding{H7922}, of the sons{H1121} of Mahli{H4249}, the son{H1121} of Levi{H3878}, the son{H1121} of Israel{H3478}; and Sherebiah{H8274}, with his sons{H1121} and his brethren{H251}, eighteen{H8083}{H6240};"
Ezra,8,19,"And Hashabiah{H2811}, and with him Jeshaiah{H3470} of the sons{H1121} of Merari{H4847}, his brethren{H251} and their sons{H1121}, twenty{H6242};"
Ezra,8,20,"Also of the Nethinims{H5411}, whom David{H1732} and the princes{H8269} had appointed{H5414}{(H8804)} for the service{H5656} of the Levites{H3881}, two hundred{H3967} and twenty{H6242} Nethinims{H5411}: all of them were expressed{H5344}{(H8738)} by name{H8034}."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed{H7121}{(H8799)} a fast{H6685} there, at the river{H5104} of Ahava{H163}, that we might afflict{H6031}{(H8692)} ourselves before{H6440} our God{H430}, to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} of him a right{H3477} way{H1870} for us, and for our little ones{H2945}, and for all our substance{H7399}."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} to require{H7592}{(H8800)} of the king{H4428} a band of soldiers{H2428} and horsemen{H6571} to help{H5826}{(H8800)} us against the enemy{H341}{(H8802)} in the way{H1870}: because we had spoken{H559}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The hand{H3027} of our God{H430} is upon all them for good{H2896} that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} him; but his power{H5797} and his wrath{H639} is against all them that forsake{H5800}{(H8802)} him."
Ezra,8,23,So we fasted{H6684}{(H8799)} and besought{H1245}{(H8762)} our God{H430} for this: and he was intreated{H6279}{(H8735)} of us.
Ezra,8,24,"Then I separated{H914}{(H8686)} twelve{H8147}{H6240} of the chief{H8269} of the priests{H3548}, Sherebiah{H8274}, Hashabiah{H2811}, and ten{H6235} of their brethren{H251} with them,"
Ezra,8,25,"And weighed{H8254}{(H8799)} unto them the silver{H3701}, and the gold{H2091}, and the vessels{H3627}, even the offering{H8641} of the house{H1004} of our God{H430}, which the king{H4428}, and his counsellors{H3289}{(H8802)}, and his lords{H8269}, and all Israel{H3478} there present{H4672}{(H8737)}, had offered{H7311}{(H8689)}:"
Ezra,8,26,"I even weighed{H8254}{(H8799)} unto their hand{H3027} six{H8337} hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701}, and silver{H3701} vessels{H3627} an hundred{H3967} talents{H3603}, and of gold{H2091} an hundred{H3967} talents{H3603};"
Ezra,8,27,"Also twenty{H6242} basons{H3713} of gold{H2091}, of a thousand{H505} drams{H150}; and two{H8147} vessels{H3627} of fine{H2896}{H6668}{(H8716)} copper{H5178}, precious{H2532} as gold{H2091}."
Ezra,8,28,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye are holy{H6944} unto the LORD{H3068}; the vessels{H3627} are holy{H6944} also; and the silver{H3701} and the gold{H2091} are a freewill offering{H5071} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of your fathers{H1}."
Ezra,8,29,"Watch{H8245}{(H8798)} ye, and keep{H8104}{(H8798)} them, until ye weigh{H8254}{(H8799)} them before{H6440} the chief{H8269} of the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881}, and chief{H8269} of the fathers{H1} of Israel{H3478}, at Jerusalem{H3389}, in the chambers{H3957} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
Ezra,8,30,"So took{H6901}{(H8765)} the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881} the weight{H4948} of the silver{H3701}, and the gold{H2091}, and the vessels{H3627}, to bring{H935}{(H8687)} them to Jerusalem{H3389} unto the house{H1004} of our God{H430}."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed{H5265}{(H8799)} from the river{H5104} of Ahava{H163} on the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} day of the first{H7223} month{H2320}, to go{H3212}{(H8800)} unto Jerusalem{H3389}: and the hand{H3027} of our God{H430} was upon us, and he delivered{H5337}{(H8686)} us from the hand{H3709} of the enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, and of such as lay in wait{H693}{(H8802)} by the way{H1870}."
Ezra,8,32,"And we came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and abode{H3427}{(H8799)} there three{H7969} days{H3117}."
Ezra,8,33,"Now on the fourth{H7243} day{H3117} was the silver{H3701} and the gold{H2091} and the vessels{H3627} weighed{H8254}{(H8738)} in the house{H1004} of our God{H430} by the hand{H3027} of Meremoth{H4822} the son{H1121} of Uriah{H223} the priest{H3548}; and with him was Eleazar{H499} the son{H1121} of Phinehas{H6372}; and with them was Jozabad{H3107} the son{H1121} of Jeshua{H3442}, and Noadiah{H5129} the son{H1121} of Binnui{H1131}, Levites{H3881};"
Ezra,8,34,By number{H4557} and by weight{H4948} of every one: and all the weight{H4948} was written{H3789}{(H8735)} at that time{H6256}.
Ezra,8,35,"Also the children{H1121} of those that had been carried away{H1473}, which were come out{H935}{(H8802)} of the captivity{H7628}, offered{H7126}{(H8689)} burnt offerings{H5930} unto the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, twelve{H8147}{H6240} bullocks{H6499} for all Israel{H3478}, ninety{H8673} and six{H8337} rams{H352}, seventy{H7657} and seven{H7651} lambs{H3532}, twelve{H8147}{H6240} he goats{H6842} for a sin offering{H2403}: all this was a burnt offering{H5930} unto the LORD{H3068}."
Ezra,8,36,"And they delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} the king's{H4428} commissions{H1881} unto the king's{H4428} lieutenants{H323}, and to the governors{H6346} on this side{H5676} the river{H5104}: and they furthered{H5375}{(H8765)} the people{H5971}, and the house{H1004} of God{H430}."
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things were done{H3615}{(H8763)}, the princes{H8269} came{H5066}{(H8738)} to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The people{H5971} of Israel{H3478}, and the priests{H3548}, and the Levites{H3881}, have not separated{H914}{(H8738)} themselves from the people{H5971} of the lands{H776}, doing according to their abominations{H8441}, even of the Canaanites{H3669}, the Hittites{H2850}, the Perizzites{H6522}, the Jebusites{H2983}, the Ammonites{H5984}, the Moabites{H4125}, the Egyptians{H4713}, and the Amorites{H567}."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken{H5375}{(H8804)} of their daughters{H1323} for themselves, and for their sons{H1121}: so that the holy{H6944} seed{H2233} have mingled{H6148}{(H8694)} themselves with the people{H5971} of those lands{H776}: yea, the hand{H3027} of the princes{H8269} and rulers{H5461} hath been chief{H7223} in this trespass{H4604}."
Ezra,9,3,"And when I heard{H8085}{(H8800)} this thing{H1697}, I rent{H7167}{(H8804)} my garment{H899} and my mantle{H4598}, and plucked off{H4803}{(H8799)} the hair{H8181} of my head{H7218} and of my beard{H2206}, and sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} astonied{H8074}{(H8789)}."
Ezra,9,4,"Then were assembled{H622}{(H8735)} unto me every one that trembled{H2730} at the words{H1697} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, because of the transgression{H4604} of those that had been carried away{H1473}; and I sat{H3427}{(H8802)} astonied{H8074}{(H8789)} until the evening{H6153} sacrifice{H4503}."
Ezra,9,5,"And at the evening{H6153} sacrifice{H4503} I arose up{H6965}{(H8804)} from my heaviness{H8589}; and having rent{H7167}{(H8800)} my garment{H899} and my mantle{H4598}, I fell{H3766}{(H8799)} upon my knees{H1290}, and spread out{H6566}{(H8799)} my hands{H3709} unto the LORD{H3068} my God{H430},"
Ezra,9,6,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, O my God{H430}, I am ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} and blush{H3637}{(H8738)} to lift up{H7311}{(H8687)} my face{H6440} to thee, my God{H430}: for our iniquities{H5771} are increased{H7235}{(H8804)} over{H4605} our head{H7218}, and our trespass{H819} is grown up{H1431}{(H8804)} unto the heavens{H8064}."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days{H3117} of our fathers{H1} have we been in a great{H1419} trespass{H819} unto this day{H3117}; and for our iniquities{H5771} have we, our kings{H4428}, and our priests{H3548}, been delivered{H5414}{(H8738)} into the hand{H3027} of the kings{H4428} of the lands{H776}, to the sword{H2719}, to captivity{H7628}, and to a spoil{H961}, and to confusion{H1322} of face{H6440}, as it is this day{H3117}."
Ezra,9,8,"And now for a little{H4592} space{H7281} grace{H8467} hath been shewed from the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, to leave{H7604}{(H8687)} us a remnant to escape{H6413}, and to give{H5414}{(H8800)} us a nail{H3489} in his holy{H6944} place{H4725}, that our God{H430} may lighten{H215}{(H8687)} our eyes{H5869}, and give{H5414}{(H8800)} us a little{H4592} reviving{H4241} in our bondage{H5659}."
Ezra,9,9,"For we were bondmen{H5650}; yet our God{H430} hath not forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} us in our bondage{H5659}, but hath extended{H5186}{(H8686)} mercy{H2617} unto us in the sight{H6440} of the kings{H4428} of Persia{H6539}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} us a reviving{H4241}, to set up{H7311}{(H8788)} the house{H1004} of our God{H430}, and to repair{H5975}{(H8687)} the desolations{H2723} thereof, and to give{H5414}{(H8800)} us a wall{H1447} in Judah{H3063} and in Jerusalem{H3389}."
Ezra,9,10,"And now, O our God{H430}, what shall we say{H559}{(H8799)} after{H310} this? for we have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} thy commandments{H4687},"
Ezra,9,11,"Which thou hast commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} by{H3027} thy servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The land{H776}, unto which ye go{H935}{(H8802)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} it, is an unclean{H5079} land{H776} with the filthiness{H5079} of the people{H5971} of the lands{H776}, with their abominations{H8441}, which have filled{H4390}{(H8765)} it from one end{H6310} to another{H6310} with their uncleanness{H2932}."
Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore give{H5414}{(H8799)} not your daughters{H1323} unto their sons{H1121}, neither take{H5375}{(H8799)} their daughters{H1323} unto your sons{H1121}, nor seek{H1875}{(H8799)} their peace{H7965} or their wealth{H2896} for{H5704} ever{H5769}: that ye may be strong{H2388}{(H8799)}, and eat{H398}{(H8804)} the good{H2898} of the land{H776}, and leave it for an inheritance{H3423}{(H8689)} to your children{H1121} for ever{H5769}."
Ezra,9,13,"And after{H310} all that is come{H935}{(H8802)} upon us for our evil{H7451} deeds{H4639}, and for our great{H1419} trespass{H819}, seeing that thou our God{H430} hast punished{H2820}{(H8804)} us less{H4295} than our iniquities{H5771} deserve, and hast given{H5414}{(H8804)} us such deliverance{H6413} as this;"
Ezra,9,14,"Should we again{H7725}{(H8799)} break{H6565}{(H8687)} thy commandments{H4687}, and join in affinity{H2859}{(H8692)} with the people{H5971} of these abominations{H8441}? wouldest not thou be angry{H599}{(H8799)} with us till thou hadst consumed{H3615}{(H8763)} us, so that there should be no remnant{H7611} nor escaping{H6413}?"
Ezra,9,15,"O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, thou art righteous{H6662}: for we remain{H7604}{(H8738)} yet escaped{H6413}, as it is this day{H3117}: behold, we are before{H6440} thee in our trespasses{H819}: for we cannot stand{H5975}{(H8800)} before{H6440} thee because of this."
Ezra,10,1,"Now when Ezra{H5830} had prayed{H6419}{(H8692)}, and when he had confessed{H3034}{(H8692)}, weeping{H1058}{(H8802)} and casting himself down{H5307}{(H8693)} before{H6440} the house{H1004} of God{H430}, there assembled{H6908}{(H8738)} unto him out of Israel{H3478} a very{H3966} great{H7227} congregation{H6951} of men{H582} and women{H802} and children{H3206}: for the people{H5971} wept{H1058}{(H8804)} very{H7235}{(H8687)} sore{H1059}."
Ezra,10,2,"And Shechaniah{H7935} the son{H1121} of Jehiel{H3171}, one of the sons{H1121} of Elam{H5867}, answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ezra{H5830}, We have trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)} against our God{H430}, and have taken{H3427}{(H8686)} strange{H5237} wives{H802} of the people{H5971} of the land{H776}: yet now there is{H3426} hope{H4723} in Israel{H3478} concerning this thing."
Ezra,10,3,"Now therefore let us make{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with our God{H430} to put away{H3318}{(H8687)} all the wives{H802}, and such as are born{H3205}{(H8737)} of them, according to the counsel{H6098} of my lord{H136}, and of those that tremble{H2730} at the commandment{H4687} of our God{H430}; and let it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} according to the law{H8451}."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}; for this matter{H1697} belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage{H2388}{(H8798)}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} it."
Ezra,10,5,"Then arose{H6965}{(H8799)} Ezra{H5830}, and made the chief{H8269} priests{H3548}, the Levites{H3881}, and all Israel{H3478}, to swear{H7650}{(H8686)} that they should do{H6213}{(H8800)} according to this word{H1697}. And they sware{H7650}{(H8735)}."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra{H5830} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} from before{H6440} the house{H1004} of God{H430}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} into the chamber{H3957} of Johanan{H3076} the son{H1121} of Eliashib{H475}: and when he came{H3212}{(H8799)} thither, he did eat{H398}{(H8804)} no bread{H3899}, nor drink{H8354}{(H8804)} water{H4325}: for he mourned{H56}{(H8693)} because of the transgression{H4604} of them that had been carried away{H1473}."
Ezra,10,7,"And they made proclamation{H5674}{(H8686)}{H6963} throughout Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389} unto all the children{H1121} of the captivity{H1473}, that they should gather themselves together{H6908}{(H8736)} unto Jerusalem{H3389};"
Ezra,10,8,"And that whosoever would not come{H935}{(H8799)} within three{H7969} days{H3117}, according to the counsel{H6098} of the princes{H8269} and the elders{H2205}, all his substance{H7399} should be forfeited{H2763}{(H8714)}, and himself separated{H914}{(H8735)} from the congregation{H6951} of those that had been carried away{H1473}."
Ezra,10,9,"Then all the men{H582} of Judah{H3063} and Benjamin{H1144} gathered themselves together{H6908}{(H8735)} unto Jerusalem{H3389} within three{H7969} days{H3117}. It was the ninth{H8671} month{H2320}, on the twentieth{H6242} day of the month{H2320}; and all the people{H5971} sat{H3427}{(H8799)} in the street{H7339} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}, trembling{H7460}{(H8688)} because of this matter{H1697}, and for the great rain{H1653}."
Ezra,10,10,"And Ezra{H5830} the priest{H3548} stood up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye have transgressed{H4603}{(H8804)}, and have taken{H3427}{(H8686)} strange{H5237} wives{H802}, to increase{H3254}{(H8687)} the trespass{H819} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezra,10,11,"Now therefore make{H5414}{(H8798)} confession{H8426} unto the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of your fathers{H1}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} his pleasure{H7522}: and separate{H914}{(H8734)} yourselves from the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, and from the strange{H5237} wives{H802}."
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the congregation{H6951} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, As thou hast said{H1697}, so must we do{H6213}{(H8800)}."
Ezra,10,13,"But{H61} the people{H5971} are many{H7227}, and it is a time{H6256} of much rain{H1653}, and we are not able{H3581} to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} without{H2351}, neither is this a work{H4399} of one{H259} day{H3117} or two{H8147}: for we are many{H7235}{(H8689)} that have transgressed{H6586}{(H8800)} in this thing{H1697}."
Ezra,10,14,"Let now our rulers{H8269} of all the congregation{H6951} stand{H5975}{(H8799)}, and let all them which have taken{H3427}{(H8689)} strange{H5237} wives{H802} in our cities{H5892} come{H935}{(H8799)} at appointed{H2163}{(H8794)} times{H6256}, and with them the elders{H2205} of every city{H5892}, and the judges{H8199}{(H8802)} thereof, until the fierce{H2740} wrath{H639} of our God{H430} for this matter{H1697} be turned{H7725}{(H8687)} from us."
Ezra,10,15,Only Jonathan{H3129} the son{H1121} of Asahel{H6214} and Jahaziah{H3167} the son{H1121} of Tikvah{H8616} were employed{H5975}{(H8804)} about this matter: and Meshullam{H4918} and Shabbethai{H7678} the Levite{H3881} helped{H5826}{(H8804)} them.
Ezra,10,16,"And the children{H1121} of the captivity{H1473} did so{H6213}{(H8799)}. And Ezra{H5830} the priest{H3548}, with certain{H582} chief{H7218} of the fathers{H1}, after the house{H1004} of their fathers{H1}, and all of them by their names{H8034}, were separated{H914}{(H8735)}, and sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} in the first{H259} day{H3117} of the tenth{H6224} month{H2320} to examine{H1875}{(H8800)} the matter{H1697}."
Ezra,10,17,And they made an end{H3615}{(H8762)} with all the men{H582} that had taken{H3427}{(H8689)} strange{H5237} wives{H802} by the first{H259} day{H3117} of the first{H7223} month{H2320}.
Ezra,10,18,"And among the sons{H1121} of the priests{H3548} there were found{H4672}{(H8735)} that had taken{H3427}{(H8689)} strange{H5237} wives{H802}: namely, of the sons{H1121} of Jeshua{H3442} the son{H1121} of Jozadak{H3136}, and his brethren{H251}; Maaseiah{H4641}, and Eliezer{H461}, and Jarib{H3402}, and Gedaliah{H1436}."
Ezra,10,19,"And they gave{H5414}{(H8799)} their hands{H3027} that they would put away{H3318}{(H8687)} their wives{H802}; and being guilty{H818}, they offered a ram{H352} of the flock{H6629} for their trespass{H819}."

Nehemiah,1,1,"The words{H1697} of Nehemiah{H5166} the son{H1121} of Hachaliah{H2446}. And it came to pass in the month{H2320} Chisleu{H3691}, in the twentieth{H6242} year{H8141}, as I was in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002},"
Nehemiah,1,2,"That Hanani{H2607}, one{H259} of my brethren{H251}, came{H935}{(H8799)}, he and certain men{H582} of Judah{H3063}; and I asked{H7592}{(H8799)} them concerning the Jews{H3064} that had escaped{H6413}, which were left{H7604}{(H8738)} of the captivity{H7628}, and concerning Jerusalem{H3389}."

Nehemiah,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard{H8085}{(H8800)} these words{H1697}, that I sat down{H3427}{(H8804)} and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}, and mourned{H56}{(H8691)} certain days{H3117}, and fasted{H6684}{(H8802)}, and prayed{H6419}{(H8693)} before{H6440} the God{H430} of heaven{H8064},"
Nehemiah,1,5,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, I beseech{H577} thee, O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of heaven{H8064}, the great{H1419} and terrible{H3372}{(H8737)} God{H410}, that keepeth{H8104}{(H8802)} covenant{H1285} and mercy{H2617} for them that love{H157}{(H8802)} him and observe{H8104}{(H8802)} his commandments{H4687}:"

Nehemiah,1,7,"We have dealt very{H2254}{(H8800)} corruptly{H2254}{(H8804)} against thee, and have not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} the commandments{H4687}, nor the statutes{H2706}, nor the judgments{H4941}, which thou commandedst{H6680}{(H8765)} thy servant{H5650} Moses{H4872}."

Nehemiah,1,10,"Now these are thy servants{H5650} and thy people{H5971}, whom thou hast redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} by thy great{H1419} power{H3581}, and by thy strong{H2389} hand{H3027}."
Nehemiah,1,11,"O Lord{H136}, I beseech{H577} thee, let now thine ear{H241} be attentive{H7183} to the prayer{H8605} of thy servant{H5650}, and to the prayer{H8605} of thy servants{H5650}, who desire{H2655} to fear{H3372}{(H8800)} thy name{H8034}: and prosper{H6743}{(H8685)}, I pray thee, thy servant{H5650} this day{H3117}, and grant{H5414}{(H8798)} him mercy{H7356} in the sight{H6440} of this man{H376}. For I was the king's{H4428} cupbearer{H8248}{(H8688)}."
Nehemiah,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month{H2320} Nisan{H5212}, in the twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of Artaxerxes{H783} the king{H4428}, that wine{H3196} was before{H6440} him: and I took up{H5375}{(H8799)} the wine{H3196}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto the king{H4428}. Now I had not been beforetime sad{H7451} in his presence{H6440}."
Nehemiah,2,2,"Wherefore the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Why is thy countenance{H6440} sad{H7451}, seeing thou art not sick{H2470}{(H8802)}? this is nothing else but sorrow{H7455} of heart{H3820}. Then I was very{H3966} sore{H7235}{(H8687)} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)},"
Nehemiah,2,3,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, Let the king{H4428} live{H2421}{(H8799)} for ever{H5769}: why should not my countenance{H6440} be sad{H3415}{(H8799)}, when the city{H5892}, the place{H1004} of my fathers{H1}' sepulchres{H6913}, lieth waste{H2720}, and the gates{H8179} thereof are consumed{H398}{(H8795)} with fire{H784}?"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, For what dost thou make request{H1245}{(H8764)}? So I prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} to the God{H430} of heaven{H8064}."
Nehemiah,2,5,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, If it please{H2895}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, and if thy servant{H5650} have found favour{H3190}{(H8799)} in thy sight{H6440}, that thou wouldest send{H7971}{(H8799)} me unto Judah{H3063}, unto the city{H5892} of my fathers{H1}' sepulchres{H6913}, that I may build{H1129}{(H8799)} it."
Nehemiah,2,6,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me,(the queen{H7694} also sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} by him{H681},) For how long shall thy journey{H4109} be? and when wilt thou return{H7725}{(H8799)}? So it pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H6440} the king{H4428} to send{H7971}{(H8799)} me; and I set{H5414}{(H8799)} him a time{H2165}."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Moreover I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, If it please{H2895}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, let letters{H107} be given{H5414}{(H8799)} me to the governors{H6346} beyond{H5676} the river{H5104}, that they may convey me over{H5674}{(H8686)} till I come{H935}{(H8799)} into Judah{H3063};"
Nehemiah,2,8,"And a letter{H107} unto Asaph{H623} the keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of the king's{H4428} forest{H6508}, that he may give{H5414}{(H8799)} me timber{H6086} to make beams{H7136}{(H8763)} for the gates{H8179} of the palace{H1002} which appertained to the house{H1004}, and for the wall{H2346} of the city{H5892}, and for the house{H1004} that I shall enter into{H935}{(H8799)}. And the king{H4428} granted{H5414}{(H8799)} me, according to the good{H2896} hand{H3027} of my God{H430} upon me."
Nehemiah,2,9,"Then I came{H935}{(H8799)} to the governors{H6346} beyond{H5676} the river{H5104}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them the king's{H4428} letters{H107}. Now the king{H4428} had sent{H7971}{(H8799)} captains{H8269} of the army{H2428} and horsemen{H6571} with me."
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat{H5571} the Horonite{H2772}, and Tobiah{H2900} the servant{H5650}, the Ammonite{H5984}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of it, it grieved{H3415}{(H8799)} them exceedingly{H7451}{H1419} that there was come{H935}{(H8804)} a man{H120} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} the welfare{H2896} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Nehemiah,2,11,"So I came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and was there three{H7969} days{H3117}."
Nehemiah,2,12,"And I arose{H6965}{(H8799)} in the night{H3915}, I and some{H4592} few{H4592} men{H582} with me; neither told{H5046}{(H8689)} I any man{H120} what my God{H430} had put{H5414}{(H8802)} in my heart{H3820} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} at Jerusalem{H3389}: neither was there any beast{H929} with me, save the beast{H929} that I rode upon{H7392}{(H8802)}."
Nehemiah,2,13,"And I went out{H3318}{(H8799)} by night{H3915} by the gate{H8179} of the valley{H1516}, even before{H6440} the dragon{H8577} well{H5869}{(H8677)}{H5886}, and to the dung{H830} port{H8179}, and viewed{H7663}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H7665}{(H8799)} the walls{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389}, which were broken down{H6555}{(H8803)}, and the gates{H8179} thereof were consumed{H398}{(H8795)} with fire{H784}."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I went on{H5674}{(H8799)} to the gate{H8179} of the fountain{H5869}, and to the king's{H4428} pool{H1295}: but there was no place{H4725} for the beast{H929} that was under me to pass{H5674}{(H8800)}."
Nehemiah,2,15,"Then went I up{H5927}{(H8802)} in the night{H3915} by the brook{H5158}, and viewed{H7663}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H7665}{(H8799)} the wall{H2346}, and turned back{H7725}{(H8799)}, and entered{H935}{(H8799)} by the gate{H8179} of the valley{H1516}, and so returned{H7725}{(H8799)}."
Nehemiah,2,16,"And the rulers{H5461} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not whither I went{H1980}{(H8804)}, or what I did{H6213}{(H8802)}; neither had I as yet{H3651} told{H5046}{(H8689)} it to the Jews{H3064}, nor to the priests{H3548}, nor to the nobles{H2715}, nor to the rulers{H5461}, nor to the rest{H3499} that did{H6213}{(H8802)} the work{H4399}."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I unto them, Ye see{H7200}{(H8802)} the distress{H7451} that we are in, how Jerusalem{H3389} lieth waste{H2720}, and the gates{H8179} thereof are burned{H3341}{(H8738)} with fire{H784}: come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us build up{H1129}{(H8799)} the wall{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389}, that we be no more a reproach{H2781}."
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I told{H5046}{(H8686)} them of the hand{H3027} of my God{H430} which was good{H2896} upon me; as also the king's{H4428} words{H1697} that he had spoken{H559}{(H8804)} unto me. And they said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let us rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} and build{H1129}{(H8804)}. So they strengthened{H2388}{(H8762)} their hands{H3027} for this good{H2896} work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat{H5571} the Horonite{H2772}, and Tobiah{H2900} the servant{H5650}, the Ammonite{H5984}, and Geshem{H1654} the Arabian{H6163}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it, they laughed us to scorn{H3932}{(H8686)}, and despised{H959}{(H8799)} us, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What is this thing{H1697} that ye do{H6213}{(H8802)}? will ye rebel{H4775}{(H8802)} against the king{H4428}?"
Nehemiah,2,20,"Then answered{H7725}{(H8686)}{H1697} I them, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, The God{H430} of heaven{H8064}, he will prosper{H6743}{(H8686)} us; therefore we his servants{H5650} will arise{H6965}{(H8799)} and build{H1129}{(H8804)}: but ye have no portion{H2506}, nor right{H6666}, nor memorial{H2146}, in Jerusalem{H3389}."
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Eliashib{H475} the high{H1419} priest{H3548} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} with his brethren{H251} the priests{H3548}, and they builded{H1129}{(H8799)} the sheep{H6629} gate{H8179}; they sanctified{H6942}{(H8765)} it, and set up{H5975}{(H8686)} the doors{H1817} of it; even unto the tower{H4026} of Meah{H3968} they sanctified{H6942}{(H8765)} it, unto the tower{H4026} of Hananeel{H2606}."
Nehemiah,3,2,And next unto him{H3027} builded{H1129}{(H8804)} the men{H582} of Jericho{H3405}. And next to them builded{H1129}{(H8804)} Zaccur{H2139} the son{H1121} of Imri{H566}.

Nehemiah,4,2,"And he spake{H559}{(H8799)} before{H6440} his brethren{H251} and the army{H2428} of Samaria{H8111}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, What do{H6213}{(H8802)} these feeble{H537} Jews{H3064}? will they fortify{H5800}{(H8799)} themselves? will they sacrifice{H2076}{(H8799)}? will they make an end{H3615}{(H8762)} in a day{H3117}? will they revive{H2421}{(H8762)} the stones{H68} out of the heaps{H6194} of the rubbish{H6083} which are burned{H8313}{(H8803)}?"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Tobiah{H2900} the Ammonite{H5984} was by him{H681}, and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Even that which they build{H1129}{(H8802)}, if a fox{H7776} go up{H5927}{(H8799)}, he shall even break down{H6555}{(H8804)} their stone{H68} wall{H2346}."
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, O our God{H430}; for we are despised{H939}: and turn{H7725}{(H8685)} their reproach{H2781} upon their own head{H7218}, and give{H5414}{(H8798)} them for a prey{H961} in the land{H776} of captivity{H7633}:"
Nehemiah,4,5,"And cover{H3680}{(H8762)} not their iniquity{H5771}, and let not their sin{H2403} be blotted out{H4229}{(H8735)} from before{H6440} thee: for they have provoked thee to anger{H3707}{(H8689)} before the builders{H1129}{(H8802)}."
Nehemiah,4,6,So built{H1129}{(H8799)} we the wall{H2346}; and all the wall{H2346} was joined together{H7194}{(H8735)} unto the half{H2677} thereof: for the people{H5971} had a mind{H3820} to work{H6213}{(H8800)}.
Nehemiah,4,7,"But it came to pass, that when Sanballat{H5571}, and Tobiah{H2900}, and the Arabians{H6163}, and the Ammonites{H5984}, and the Ashdodites{H796}, heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that the walls{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389} were made up{H724}{H5927}{(H8804)}, and that the breaches{H6555}{(H8803)} began{H2490}{(H8689)} to be stopped{H5640}{(H8736)}, then they were very{H3966} wroth{H2734}{(H8799)},"
Nehemiah,4,8,"And conspired{H7194}{(H8799)} all of them together{H3162} to come{H935}{(H8800)} and to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} against Jerusalem{H3389}, and to hinder{H6213}{(H8800)}{H8442} it."
Nehemiah,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer{H6419}{(H8691)} unto our God{H430}, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} a watch{H4929} against them day{H3119} and night{H3915}, because{H6440} of them."
Nehemiah,4,10,"And Judah{H3063} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The strength{H3581} of the bearers of burdens{H5449} is decayed{H3782}{(H8804)}, and there is much{H7235}{(H8687)} rubbish{H6083}; so that we are not able{H3201}{(H8799)} to build{H1129}{(H8800)} the wall{H2346}."
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our adversaries{H6862} said{H559}{(H8799)}, They shall not know{H3045}{(H8799)}, neither see{H7200}{(H8799)}, till we come{H935}{(H8799)} in the midst{H8432} among{H8432} them, and slay{H2026}{(H8804)} them, and cause the work{H4399} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)}."
Nehemiah,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Jews{H3064} which dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} by them{H681} came{H935}{(H8804)}, they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto us ten{H6235} times{H6471}, From all places{H4725} whence ye shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto us they will be upon you."
Nehemiah,4,13,"Therefore set{H5975}{(H8686)} I in the lower{H8482} places{H4725} behind{H310} the wall{H2346}, and on the higher places{H6706}{(H8675)}{H6708}, I even set{H5975}{(H8686)} the people{H5971} after their families{H4940} with their swords{H2719}, their spears{H7420}, and their bows{H7198}."
Nehemiah,4,14,"And I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the nobles{H2715}, and to the rulers{H5461}, and to the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971}, Be not ye afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of them{H6440}: remember{H2142}{(H8798)} the Lord{H136}, which is great{H1419} and terrible{H3372}{(H8737)}, and fight{H3898}{(H8734)} for your brethren{H251}, your sons{H1121}, and your daughters{H1323}, your wives{H802}, and your houses{H1004}."
Nehemiah,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies{H341}{(H8802)} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that it was known{H3045}{(H8738)} unto us, and God{H430} had brought{H6565} their counsel{H6098} to nought{H6565}{(H8686)}, that we returned{H7725}{(H8799)} all of us to the wall{H2346}, every one{H376} unto his work{H4399}."
Nehemiah,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time{H3117} forth, that the half{H2677} of my servants{H5288} wrought{H6213}{(H8802)} in the work{H4399}, and the other half{H2677} of them held{H2388}{(H8688)} both the spears{H7420}, the shields{H4043}, and the bows{H7198}, and the habergeons{H8302}; and the rulers{H8269} were behind{H310} all the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}."
Nehemiah,4,17,"They which builded{H1129}{(H8802)} on the wall{H2346}, and they that bare{H5375}{(H8802)} burdens{H5447}, with those that laded{H6006}{(H8802)}, every one with one{H259} of his hands{H3027} wrought{H6213}{(H8802)} in the work{H4399}, and with the other{H259} hand held{H2388}{(H8688)} a weapon{H7973}."
Nehemiah,4,18,"For the builders{H1129}{(H8802)}, every one{H376} had his sword{H2719} girded{H631}{(H8803)} by his side{H4975}, and so builded{H1129}{(H8802)}. And he that sounded{H8628}{(H8802)} the trumpet{H7782} was by me{H681}."
Nehemiah,4,19,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the nobles{H2715}, and to the rulers{H5461}, and to the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971}, The work{H4399} is great{H7235}{(H8687)} and large{H7342}, and we are separated{H6504}{(H8737)} upon the wall{H2346}, one{H376} far from{H7350} another{H251}."
Nehemiah,4,20,"In what place{H4725} therefore ye hear{H8085}{(H8799)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, resort{H6908}{(H8735)} ye thither unto us: our God{H430} shall fight{H3898}{(H8735)} for us."
Nehemiah,4,21,So we laboured{H6213}{(H8802)} in the work{H4399}: and half{H2677} of them held{H2388}{(H8688)} the spears{H7420} from the rising{H5927}{(H8800)} of the morning{H7837} till the stars{H3556} appeared{H3318}{(H8800)}.
Nehemiah,4,22,"Likewise at the same time{H6256} said{H559}{(H8804)} I unto the people{H5971}, Let every one{H376} with his servant{H5288} lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} within{H8432} Jerusalem{H3389}, that in the night{H3915} they may be a guard{H4929} to us, and labour{H4399} on the day{H3117}."
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren{H251}, nor my servants{H5288}, nor the men{H582} of the guard{H4929} which followed{H310} me, none of us{H587} put off{H6584}{(H8802)} our clothes{H899}, saving that every one{H376} put them off{H7973} for washing{H4325}."
Nehemiah,5,1,And there was a great{H1419} cry{H6818} of the people{H5971} and of their wives{H802} against their brethren{H251} the Jews{H3064}.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were{H3426} that said{H559}{(H8802)}, We, our sons{H1121}, and our daughters{H1323}, are many{H7227}: therefore we take up{H3947}{(H8799)} corn{H1715} for them, that we may eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Nehemiah,5,3,"Some also there were{H3426} that said{H559}{(H8802)}, We have mortgaged{H6148}{(H8802)} our lands{H7704}, vineyards{H3754}, and houses{H1004}, that we might buy{H3947}{(H8799)} corn{H1715}, because of the dearth{H7458}."
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were{H3426} also that said{H559}{(H8802)}, We have borrowed{H3867}{(H8804)} money{H3701} for the king's{H4428} tribute{H4060}, and that upon our lands{H7704} and vineyards{H3754}."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh{H1320} is as the flesh{H1320} of our brethren{H251}, our children{H1121} as their children{H1121}: and, lo, we bring into bondage{H3533}{(H8802)} our sons{H1121} and our daughters{H1323} to be servants{H5650}, and some of our daughters{H1323} are{H3426} brought unto bondage{H3533}{(H8737)} already: neither is it in our power{H410}{H3027} to redeem them; for other men{H312} have our lands{H7704} and vineyards{H3754}."
Nehemiah,5,6,And I was very{H3966} angry{H2734}{(H8799)} when I heard{H8085}{(H8804)} their cry{H2201} and these words{H1697}.
Nehemiah,5,7,"Then I consulted{H4427}{(H8735)} with myself{H3820}, and I rebuked{H7378}{(H8799)} the nobles{H2715}, and the rulers{H5461}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Ye exact{H5378}{(H8801)}{(H8678)}{H5383}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H5375}{(H8802)} usury{H4855}, every one{H376} of his brother{H251}. And I set{H5414}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} assembly{H6952} against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, We after our ability{H1767} have redeemed{H7069}{(H8804)} our brethren{H251} the Jews{H3064}, which were sold{H4376}{(H8737)} unto the heathen{H1471}; and will ye even sell{H4376}{(H8799)} your brethren{H251}? or shall they be sold{H4376}{(H8738)} unto us? Then held they their peace{H2790}{(H8686)}, and found{H4672}{(H8804)} nothing{H1697} to answer."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Also I said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is not good{H2896} that{H1697} ye do{H6213}{(H8802)}: ought ye not to walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in the fear{H3374} of our God{H430} because of the reproach{H2781} of the heathen{H1471} our enemies{H341}{(H8802)}?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"I likewise, and my brethren{H251}, and my servants{H5288}, might exact{H5383}{(H8802)} of them money{H3701} and corn{H1715}: I pray you, let us leave off{H5800}{(H8799)} this usury{H4855}."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Restore{H7725}{(H8685)}, I pray you, to them, even this day{H3117}, their lands{H7704}, their vineyards{H3754}, their oliveyards{H2132}, and their houses{H1004}, also the hundredth{H3967} part of the money{H3701}, and of the corn{H1715}, the wine{H8492}, and the oil{H3323}, that ye exact{H5383}{(H8802)} of them."
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} they, We will restore{H7725}{(H8686)} them, and will require{H1245}{(H8762)} nothing of them; so will we do{H6213}{(H8799)} as thou sayest{H559}{(H8802)}. Then I called{H7121}{(H8799)} the priests{H3548}, and took an oath{H7650}{(H8686)} of them, that they should do{H6213}{(H8800)} according to this promise{H1697}."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Also I shook{H5287}{(H8804)} my lap{H2684}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, So God{H430} shake out{H5287}{(H8762)} every man{H376} from his house{H1004}, and from his labour{H3018}, that performeth{H6965}{(H8686)} not this promise{H1697}, even thus be he shaken out{H5287}{(H8803)}, and emptied{H7386}. And all the congregation{H6951} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Amen{H543}, and praised{H1984}{(H8762)} the LORD{H3068}. And the people{H5971} did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to this promise{H1697}."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover from the time{H3117} that I was appointed{H6680}{(H8765)} to be their governor{H6346} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}, from the twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} even unto the two{H8147} and thirtieth{H7970} year{H8141} of Artaxerxes{H783} the king{H4428}, that is, twelve{H8147}{H6240} years{H8141}, I and my brethren{H251} have not eaten{H398}{(H8804)} the bread{H3899} of the governor{H6346}."
Nehemiah,5,15,"But the former{H7223} governors{H6346} that had been before{H6440} me were chargeable{H3513}{(H8689)} unto the people{H5971}, and had taken{H3947}{(H8799)} of them bread{H3899} and wine{H3196}, beside{H310} forty{H705} shekels{H8255} of silver{H3701}; yea, even{H1571} their servants{H5288} bare rule{H7980}{(H8804)} over the people{H5971}: but so did{H6213}{(H8804)} not I, because{H6440} of the fear{H3374} of God{H430}."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Yea, also I continued{H2388}{(H8689)} in the work{H4399} of this wall{H2346}, neither bought{H7069}{(H8804)} we any land{H7704}: and all my servants{H5288} were gathered{H6908}{(H8803)} thither unto the work{H4399}."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover there were at my table{H7979} an hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}{H376} of the Jews{H3064} and rulers{H5461}, beside those that came{H935}{(H8802)} unto us from among the heathen{H1471} that are about us{H5439}."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now that which was prepared{H6213}{(H8737)} for me daily{H3117} was one{H259} ox{H7794} and six{H8337} choice{H1305}{(H8803)} sheep{H6629}; also fowls{H6833} were prepared{H6213}{(H8738)} for me, and once in ten{H6235} days{H3117} store{H7235}{(H8687)} of all sorts of wine{H3196}: yet for all{H5973} this required{H1245}{(H8765)} not I the bread{H3899} of the governor{H6346}, because the bondage{H5656} was heavy{H3513}{(H8804)} upon this people{H5971}."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Think{H2142}{(H8798)} upon me, my God{H430}, for good{H2896}, according to all that I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} for this people{H5971}."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when Sanballat{H5571}, and Tobiah{H2900}, and Geshem{H1654} the Arabian{H6163}, and the rest{H3499} of our enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, heard{H8085}{(H8738)} that I had builded{H1129}{(H8804)} the wall{H2346}, and that there was no breach{H6556} left{H3498}{(H8738)} therein;(though{H1571}{H5704} at that time{H6256} I had not set up{H5975}{(H8689)} the doors{H1817} upon the gates{H8179};)"
Nehemiah,6,2,"That Sanballat{H5571} and Geshem{H1654} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, let us meet{H3259}{(H8735)} together{H3162} in some one of the villages{H3715} in the plain{H1237} of Ono{H207}. But they thought{H2803}{(H8802)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} me mischief{H7451}."
Nehemiah,6,3,"And I sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I am doing{H6213}{(H8802)} a great{H1419} work{H4399}, so that I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} come down{H3381}{(H8800)}: why should the work{H4399} cease{H7673}{(H8799)}, whilst{H834} I leave{H7503}{(H8686)} it, and come down{H3381}{(H8804)} to you?"
Nehemiah,6,4,Yet they sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto me four{H702} times{H6471} after this sort{H1697}; and I answered{H7725}{(H8686)} them after the same manner{H1697}.
Nehemiah,6,5,Then sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Sanballat{H5571} his servant{H5288} unto me in like manner{H1697} the fifth{H2549} time{H6471} with an open{H6605}{(H8803)} letter{H107} in his hand{H3027};
Nehemiah,6,6,"Wherein was written{H3789}{(H8803)}, It is reported{H8085}{(H8738)} among the heathen{H1471}, and Gashmu{H1654} saith{H559}{(H8802)} it, that thou and the Jews{H3064} think{H2803}{(H8802)} to rebel{H4775}{(H8800)}: for which cause{H3651} thou buildest{H1129}{(H8802)} the wall{H2346}, that thou mayest be{H1933}{(H8802)} their king{H4428}, according to these words{H1697}."
Nehemiah,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed{H5975}{(H8689)} prophets{H5030} to preach{H7121}{(H8800)} of thee at Jerusalem{H3389}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, There is a king{H4428} in Judah{H3063}: and now shall it be reported{H8085}{(H8735)} to the king{H4428} according to these words{H1697}. Come{H3212}{(H8798)} now therefore, and let us take counsel{H3289}{(H8735)} together{H3162}."
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, There are{H1961} no such things{H1697} done{H1961}{(H8738)} as thou sayest{H559}{(H8802)}, but thou feignest{H908}{(H8802)} them out of thine own heart{H3820}."
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all made us afraid{H3372}{(H8764)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Their hands{H3027} shall be weakened{H7503}{(H8799)} from the work{H4399}, that it be not done{H6213}{(H8735)}. Now therefore, O God, strengthen{H2388}{(H8761)} my hands{H3027}."
Nehemiah,6,10,"Afterward I came{H935}{(H8804)} unto the house{H1004} of Shemaiah{H8098} the son{H1121} of Delaiah{H1806} the son{H1121} of Mehetabeel{H4105}, who was shut up{H6113}{(H8803)}; and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let us meet together{H3259}{(H8735)} in the house{H1004} of God{H430}, within{H8432} the temple{H1964}, and let us shut{H5462}{(H8799)} the doors{H1817} of the temple{H1964}: for they will come{H935}{(H8802)} to slay{H2026}{(H8800)} thee; yea, in the night{H3915} will they come{H935}{(H8802)} to slay{H2026}{(H8800)} thee."
Nehemiah,6,11,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, Should such{H3644} a man{H376} as I flee{H1272}{(H8799)}? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go{H935}{(H8799)} into the temple{H1964} to save his life{H2425}{(H8804)}? I will not go in{H935}{(H8799)}."
Nehemiah,6,12,"And, lo, I perceived{H5234}{(H8686)} that God{H430} had not sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him; but that he pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} this prophecy{H5016} against me: for Tobiah{H2900} and Sanballat{H5571} had hired{H7936}{(H8804)} him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"Therefore was he hired{H7936}{(H8803)}, that I should be afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, and do so{H6213}{(H8799)}, and sin{H2398}{(H8804)}, and that they might have matter for an evil{H7451} report{H8034}, that they might reproach{H2778}{(H8762)} me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"My God{H430}, think{H2142}{(H8798)} thou upon Tobiah{H2900} and Sanballat{H5571} according to these their works{H4639}, and on the prophetess{H5031} Noadiah{H5129}, and the rest{H3499} of the prophets{H5030}, that would have put me in fear{H3372}{(H8764)}."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall{H2346} was finished{H7999}{(H8799)} in the twenty{H6242} and fifth{H2568} day of the month Elul{H435}, in fifty{H2572} and two{H8147} days{H3117}."
Nehemiah,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies{H341}{(H8802)} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} thereof, and all the heathen{H1471} that were about us{H5439} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} these things, they were much{H3966} cast down{H5307}{(H8799)} in their own eyes{H5869}: for they perceived{H3045}{(H8799)} that this work{H4399} was wrought{H6213}{(H8738)} of our God{H430}."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Moreover in those days{H3117} the nobles{H2715} of Judah{H3063} sent{H1980}{(H8802)} many{H7235}{(H8688)} letters{H107} unto Tobiah{H2900}, and the letters of Tobiah{H2900} came{H935}{(H8802)} unto them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For there were many{H7227} in Judah{H3063} sworn{H1167}{H7621} unto him, because he was the son in law{H2860} of Shechaniah{H7935} the son{H1121} of Arah{H733}; and his son{H1121} Johanan{H3076} had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} the daughter{H1323} of Meshullam{H4918} the son{H1121} of Berechiah{H1296}."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Also they reported{H559}{(H8802)} his good deeds{H2896} before{H6440} me, and uttered{H3318}{(H8688)} my words{H1697} to him. And Tobiah{H2900} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} letters{H107} to put me in fear{H3372}{(H8763)}."
Nehemiah,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall{H2346} was built{H1129}{(H8738)}, and I had set up{H5975}{(H8686)} the doors{H1817}, and the porters{H7778} and the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} and the Levites{H3881} were appointed{H6485}{(H8735)},"
Nehemiah,7,2,"That I gave my brother{H251} Hanani{H2607}, and Hananiah{H2608} the ruler{H8269} of the palace{H1002}, charge{H6680}{(H8762)} over Jerusalem{H3389}: for he was a faithful{H571} man{H376}, and feared{H3372}{(H8804)} God{H430} above many{H7227}."
Nehemiah,7,3,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Let not the gates{H8179} of Jerusalem{H3389} be opened{H6605}{(H8735)} until the sun{H8121} be hot{H2527}; and while they stand by{H5975}{(H8802)}, let them shut{H1479}{(H8686)} the doors{H1817}, and bar{H270}{(H8798)} them: and appoint{H5975}{(H8687)} watches{H4931} of the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, every one{H376} in his watch{H4929}, and every one{H376} to be over against his house{H1004}."
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city{H5892} was large{H7342}{H3027} and great{H1419}: but the people{H5971} were few{H4592} therein{H8432}, and the houses{H1004} were not builded{H1129}{(H8803)}."
Nehemiah,7,5,"And my God{H430} put{H5414}{(H8799)} into mine heart{H3820} to gather together{H6908}{(H8799)} the nobles{H2715}, and the rulers{H5461}, and the people{H5971}, that they might be reckoned by genealogy{H3187}{(H8692)}.

Nehemiah,8,14,"And they found{H4672}{(H8799)} written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} which the LORD{H3068} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} by{H3027} Moses{H4872}, that the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} should dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in booths{H5521} in the feast{H2282} of the seventh{H7637} month{H2320}:"
Nehemiah,8,15,"And that they should publish{H8085}{(H8686)} and proclaim{H5674}{(H8686)}{H6963} in all their cities{H5892}, and in Jerusalem{H3389}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Go forth{H3318}{(H8798)} unto the mount{H2022}, and fetch{H935}{(H8685)} olive{H2132} branches{H5929}, and pine{H8081} branches{H6086}{H5929}, and myrtle{H1918} branches{H5929}, and palm{H8558} branches{H5929}, and branches{H5929} of thick{H5687} trees{H6086}, to make{H6213}{(H8800)} booths{H5521}, as it is written{H3789}{(H8803)}."
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people{H5971} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them, and made{H6213}{(H8799)} themselves booths{H5521}, every one{H376} upon the roof of his house{H1406}, and in their courts{H2691}, and in the courts{H2691} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}, and in the street{H7339} of the water{H4325} gate{H8179}, and in the street{H7339} of the gate{H8179} of Ephraim{H669}."
Nehemiah,8,17,"And all the congregation{H6951} of them that were come again{H7725}{(H8802)} out of the captivity{H7628} made{H6213}{(H8799)} booths{H5521}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} under the booths{H5521}: for since the days{H3117} of Jeshua{H3442} the son{H1121} of Nun{H5126} unto that day{H3117} had not the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} done so{H6213}{(H8804)}. And there was very{H3966} great{H1419} gladness{H8057}."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day{H3117} by day{H3117}, from the first{H7223} day{H3117} unto the last{H314} day{H3117}, he read{H7121}{(H8799)} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451} of God{H430}. And they kept{H6213}{(H8799)} the feast{H2282} seven{H7651} days{H3117}; and on the eighth{H8066} day{H3117} was a solemn assembly{H6116}, according unto the manner{H4941}."
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now in the twenty{H6242} and fourth{H702} day{H3117} of this month{H2320} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} were assembled{H622}{(H8738)} with fasting{H6685}, and with sackclothes{H8242}, and earth{H127} upon them."
Nehemiah,9,2,"And the seed{H2233} of Israel{H3478} separated{H914}{(H8735)} themselves from all strangers{H1121}{H5236}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} and confessed{H3034}{(H8691)} their sins{H2403}, and the iniquities{H5771} of their fathers{H1}."
Nehemiah,9,3,"And they stood up{H6965}{(H8799)} in their place{H5977}, and read{H7121}{(H8799)} in the book{H5612} of the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} one fourth part{H7243} of the day{H3117}; and another fourth part{H7243} they confessed{H3034}{(H8693)}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8693)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Then stood up{H6965}{(H8799)} upon the stairs{H4608}, of the Levites{H3881}, Jeshua{H3442}, and Bani{H1137}, Kadmiel{H6934}, Shebaniah{H7645}, Bunni{H1138}, Sherebiah{H8274}, Bani{H1137}, and Chenani{H3662}, and cried{H2199}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963} unto the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites{H3881}, Jeshua{H3442}, and Kadmiel{H6934}, Bani{H1137}, Hashabniah{H2813}, Sherebiah{H8274}, Hodijah{H1941}, Shebaniah{H7645}, and Pethahiah{H6611}, said{H559}{(H8799)}, Stand up{H6965}{(H8798)} and bless{H1288}{(H8761)} the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} for ever{H5769} and ever{H5769}: and blessed{H1288}{(H8762)} be thy glorious{H3519} name{H8034}, which is exalted{H7311}{(H8784)} above all blessing{H1293} and praise{H8416}."
Nehemiah,9,6,"Thou, even thou, art LORD{H3068} alone; thou hast made{H6213}{(H8804)} heaven{H8064}, the heaven{H8064} of heavens{H8064}, with all their host{H6635}, the earth{H776}, and all things that are therein, the seas{H3220}, and all that is therein, and thou preservest{H2421}{(H8764)} them all; and the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064} worshippeth{H7812}{(H8693)} thee."
Nehemiah,9,7,"Thou art the LORD{H3068} the God{H430}, who didst choose{H977}{(H8804)} Abram{H87}, and broughtest him forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of Ur{H218} of the Chaldees{H3778}, and gavest{H7760}{(H8804)} him the name{H8034} of Abraham{H85};"
Nehemiah,9,8,"And foundest{H4672}{(H8804)} his heart{H3824} faithful{H539}{(H8737)} before{H6440} thee, and madest{H3772}{(H8800)} a covenant{H1285} with him to give{H5414}{(H8800)} the land{H776} of the Canaanites{H3669}, the Hittites{H2850}, the Amorites{H567}, and the Perizzites{H6522}, and the Jebusites{H2983}, and the Girgashites{H1622}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} it, I say, to his seed{H2233}, and hast performed{H6965}{(H8686)} thy words{H1697}; for thou art righteous{H6662}:"
Nehemiah,9,9,"And didst see{H7200}{(H8799)} the affliction{H6040} of our fathers{H1} in Egypt{H4714}, and heardest{H8085}{(H8804)} their cry{H2201} by the Red{H5488} sea{H3220};"
Nehemiah,9,10,"And shewedst{H5414}{(H8799)} signs{H226} and wonders{H4159} upon Pharaoh{H6547}, and on all his servants{H5650}, and on all the people{H5971} of his land{H776}: for thou knewest{H3045}{(H8804)} that they dealt proudly{H2102}{(H8689)} against them. So didst thou get{H6213}{(H8799)} thee a name{H8034}, as it is this day{H3117}."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And thou didst divide{H1234}{(H8804)} the sea{H3220} before{H6440} them, so that they went through{H5674}{(H8799)} the midst{H8432} of the sea{H3220} on the dry land{H3004}; and their persecutors{H7291}{(H8802)} thou threwest{H7993}{(H8689)} into the deeps{H4688}, as a stone{H68} into the mighty{H5794} waters{H4325}."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover thou leddest{H5148}{(H8689)} them in the day{H3119} by a cloudy{H6051} pillar{H5982}; and in the night{H3915} by a pillar{H5982} of fire{H784}, to give them light{H215}{(H8687)} in the way{H1870} wherein they should go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Nehemiah,9,13,"Thou camest down{H3381}{(H8804)} also upon mount{H2022} Sinai{H5514}, and spakest{H1696}{(H8763)} with them from heaven{H8064}, and gavest{H5414}{(H8799)} them right{H3477} judgments{H4941}, and true{H571} laws{H8451}, good{H2896} statutes{H2706} and commandments{H4687}:"
Nehemiah,9,14,"And madest known{H3045}{(H8689)} unto them thy holy{H6944} sabbath{H7676}, and commandedst{H6680}{(H8765)} them precepts{H4687}, statutes{H2706}, and laws{H8451}, by the hand{H3027} of Moses{H4872} thy servant{H5650}:"
Nehemiah,9,15,"And gavest{H5414}{(H8804)} them bread{H3899} from heaven{H8064} for their hunger{H7458}, and broughtest forth{H3318}{(H8689)} water{H4325} for them out of the rock{H5553} for their thirst{H6772}, and promisedst{H559}{(H8799)} them that they should go in{H935}{(H8800)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} the land{H776} which thou hadst sworn{H3027}{H5375}{(H8804)} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers{H1} dealt proudly{H2102}{(H8689)}, and hardened{H7185}{(H8686)} their necks{H6203}, and hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not to thy commandments{H4687},"
Nehemiah,9,17,"And refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to obey{H8085}{(H8800)}, neither were mindful{H2142}{(H8804)} of thy wonders{H6381}{(H8737)} that thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} among them; but hardened{H7185}{(H8686)} their necks{H6203}, and in their rebellion{H4805} appointed{H5414}{(H8799)} a captain{H7218} to return{H7725}{(H8800)} to their bondage{H5659}: but thou art a God{H433} ready to pardon{H5547}, gracious{H2587} and merciful{H7349}, slow{H750} to anger{H639}, and of great{H7227} kindness{H2617}, and forsookest{H5800}{(H8804)} them not."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made{H6213}{(H8804)} them a molten{H4541} calf{H5695}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is thy God{H430} that brought thee up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of Egypt{H4714}, and had wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} great{H1419} provocations{H5007};"
Nehemiah,9,19,"Yet thou in thy manifold{H7227} mercies{H7356} forsookest{H5800}{(H8804)} them not in the wilderness{H4057}: the pillar{H5982} of the cloud{H6051} departed{H5493}{(H8804)} not from them by day{H3119}, to lead{H5148}{(H8687)} them in the way{H1870}; neither the pillar{H5982} of fire{H784} by night{H3915}, to shew them light{H215}{(H8687)}, and the way{H1870} wherein they should go{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Nehemiah,9,20,"Thou gavest{H5414}{(H8804)} also thy good{H2896} spirit{H7307} to instruct{H7919}{(H8687)} them, and withheldest{H4513}{(H8804)} not thy manna{H4478} from their mouth{H6310}, and gavest{H5414}{(H8804)} them water{H4325} for their thirst{H6772}."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yea, forty{H705} years{H8141} didst thou sustain{H3557}{(H8773)} them in the wilderness{H4057}, so that they lacked{H2637}{(H8804)} nothing; their clothes{H8008} waxed not old{H1086}{(H8804)}, and their feet{H7272} swelled{H1216}{(H8804)} not."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover thou gavest{H5414}{(H8799)} them kingdoms{H4467} and nations{H5971}, and didst divide{H2505}{(H8799)} them into corners{H6285}: so they possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} the land{H776} of Sihon{H5511}, and the land{H776} of the king{H4428} of Heshbon{H2809}, and the land{H776} of Og{H5747} king{H4428} of Bashan{H1316}."
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children{H1121} also multipliedst{H7235}{(H8689)} thou as the stars{H3556} of heaven{H8064}, and broughtest{H935}{(H8686)} them into the land{H776}, concerning which thou hadst promised{H559}{(H8804)} to their fathers{H1}, that they should go in{H935}{(H8800)} to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} it."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children{H1121} went in{H935}{(H8799)} and possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} the land{H776}, and thou subduedst{H3665}{(H8686)} before{H6440} them the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}, the Canaanites{H3669}, and gavest{H5414}{(H8799)} them into their hands{H3027}, with their kings{H4428}, and the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, that they might do{H6213}{(H8800)} with them as they would{H7522}."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took{H3920}{(H8799)} strong{H1219}{(H8803)} cities{H5892}, and a fat{H8082} land{H127}, and possessed{H3423}{(H8799)} houses{H1004} full{H4392} of all goods{H2898}, wells{H953} digged{H2672}{(H8803)}, vineyards{H3754}, and oliveyards{H2132}, and fruit{H3978} trees{H6086} in abundance{H7230}: so they did eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and were filled{H7646}{(H8799)}, and became fat{H8080}{(H8686)}, and delighted{H5727}{(H8691)} themselves in thy great{H1419} goodness{H2898}."
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient{H4784}{(H8686)}, and rebelled{H4775}{(H8799)} against thee, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} thy law{H8451} behind{H310} their backs{H1458}, and slew{H2026}{(H8804)} thy prophets{H5030} which testified{H5749}{(H8689)} against them to turn{H7725}{(H8687)} them to thee, and they wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} great{H1419} provocations{H5007}."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore thou deliveredst{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H6862}, who vexed{H6887}{(H8686)} them: and in the time{H6256} of their trouble{H6869}, when they cried{H6817}{(H8799)} unto thee, thou heardest{H8085}{(H8799)} them from heaven{H8064}; and according to thy manifold{H7227} mercies{H7356} thou gavest{H5414}{(H8799)} them saviours{H3467}{(H8688)}, who saved{H3467}{(H8686)} them out of the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H6862}."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest{H5117}{(H8800)}, they did{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451} again{H7725}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee: therefore leftest{H5800}{(H8799)} thou them in the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, so that they had the dominion{H7287}{(H8799)} over them: yet when they returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and cried{H2199}{(H8799)} unto thee, thou heardest{H8085}{(H8799)} them from heaven{H8064}; and many{H7227} times{H6256} didst thou deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} them according to thy mercies{H7356};"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And testifiedst{H5749}{(H8686)} against them, that thou mightest bring them again{H7725}{(H8687)} unto thy law{H8451}: yet they dealt proudly{H2102}{(H8689)}, and hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto thy commandments{H4687}, but sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thy judgments{H4941},(which if a man{H120} do{H6213}{(H8799)}, he shall live{H2421}{(H8804)} in them;) and withdrew{H5414}{(H8799)}{H5637}{(H8802)} the shoulder{H3802}, and hardened{H7185}{(H8689)} their neck{H6203}, and would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many{H7227} years{H8141} didst thou forbear{H4900}{(H8799)} them, and testifiedst{H5749}{(H8686)} against them by thy spirit{H7307} in{H3027} thy prophets{H5030}: yet would they not give ear{H238}{(H8689)}: therefore gavest{H5414}{(H8799)} thou them into the hand{H3027} of the people{H5971} of the lands{H776}."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless for thy great{H7227} mercies{H7356}' sake thou didst{H6213}{(H8804)} not utterly consume{H3617} them, nor forsake{H5800}{(H8804)} them; for thou art a gracious{H2587} and merciful{H7349} God{H410}."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God{H430}, the great{H1419}, the mighty{H1368}, and the terrible{H3372}{(H8737)} God{H410}, who keepest{H8104}{(H8802)} covenant{H1285} and mercy{H2617}, let not all the trouble{H8513} seem little{H4591}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee, that hath come{H4672}{(H8804)} upon us, on our kings{H4428}, on our princes{H8269}, and on our priests{H3548}, and on our prophets{H5030}, and on our fathers{H1}, and on all thy people{H5971}, since the time{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Assyria{H804} unto this day{H3117}."
Nehemiah,9,33,"Howbeit thou art just{H6662} in all that is brought{H935}{(H8802)} upon us; for thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} right{H571}, but we have done wickedly{H7561}{(H8689)}:"
Nehemiah,9,34,"Neither have our kings{H4428}, our princes{H8269}, our priests{H3548}, nor our fathers{H1}, kept{H6213}{(H8804)} thy law{H8451}, nor hearkened{H7181}{(H8689)} unto thy commandments{H4687} and thy testimonies{H5715}, wherewith thou didst testify{H5749}{(H8689)} against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served{H5647}{(H8804)} thee in their kingdom{H4438}, and in thy great{H7227} goodness{H2898} that thou gavest{H5414}{(H8804)} them, and in the large{H7342} and fat{H8082} land{H776} which thou gavest{H5414}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them, neither turned{H7725}{(H8804)} they from their wicked{H7451} works{H4611}."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are servants{H5650} this day{H3117}, and for the land{H776} that thou gavest{H5414}{(H8804)} unto our fathers{H1} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} the fruit{H6529} thereof and the good{H2898} thereof, behold, we are servants{H5650} in it:"
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much{H7235}{(H8688)} increase{H8393} unto the kings{H4428} whom thou hast set{H5414}{(H8804)} over us because of our sins{H2403}: also they have dominion{H4910}{(H8802)} over our bodies{H1472}, and over our cattle{H929}, at their pleasure{H7522}, and we are in great{H1419} distress{H6869}."
Nehemiah,9,38,"And because of all this we make{H3772}{(H8802)} a sure{H548} covenant, and write{H3789}{(H8802)} it; and our princes{H8269}, Levites{H3881}, and priests{H3548}, seal{H2856}{(H8803)} unto it."
Nehemiah,10,1,"Now those that sealed{H2856}{(H8803)} were, Nehemiah{H5166}, the Tirshatha{H8660}, the son{H1121} of Hachaliah{H2446}, and Zidkijah{H6667},"

Nehemiah,12,22,"The Levites{H3881} in the days{H3117} of Eliashib{H475}, Joiada{H3111}, and Johanan{H3110}, and Jaddua{H3037}, were recorded{H3789}{(H8803)} chief{H7218} of the fathers{H1}: also the priests{H3548}, to the reign{H4438} of Darius{H1867} the Persian{H6542}."
Nehemiah,12,23,"The sons{H1121} of Levi{H3878}, the chief{H7218} of the fathers{H1}, were written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}, even until the days{H3117} of Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Eliashib{H475}."
Nehemiah,12,24,"And the chief{H7218} of the Levites{H3881}: Hashabiah{H2811}, Sherebiah{H8274}, and Jeshua{H3442} the son{H1121} of Kadmiel{H6934}, with their brethren{H251} over against them, to praise{H1984}{(H8763)} and to give thanks{H3034}{(H8687)}, according to the commandment{H4687} of David{H1732} the man{H376} of God{H430}, ward{H4929} over against{H5980} ward{H4929}."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah{H4983}, and Bakbukiah{H1229}, Obadiah{H5662}, Meshullam{H4918}, Talmon{H2929}, Akkub{H6126}, were porters{H7778} keeping{H8104}{(H8802)} the ward{H4929} at the thresholds{H624} of the gates{H8179}."
Nehemiah,12,26,"These were in the days{H3117} of Joiakim{H3113} the son{H1121} of Jeshua{H3442}, the son{H1121} of Jozadak{H3136}, and in the days{H3117} of Nehemiah{H5166} the governor{H6346}, and of Ezra{H5830} the priest{H3548}, the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}."
Nehemiah,12,27,"And at the dedication{H2598} of the wall{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389} they sought{H1245}{(H8765)} the Levites{H3881} out of all their places{H4725}, to bring{H935}{(H8687)} them to Jerusalem{H3389}, to keep{H6213}{(H8800)} the dedication{H2598} with gladness{H8057}, both with thanksgivings{H8426}, and with singing{H7892}, with cymbals{H4700}, psalteries{H5035}, and with harps{H3658}."
Nehemiah,12,28,"And the sons{H1121} of the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} gathered themselves together{H622}{(H8735)}, both out of the plain country{H3603} round about{H5439} Jerusalem{H3389}, and from the villages{H2691} of Netophathi{H5200};"
Nehemiah,12,29,"Also from the house{H1004} of Gilgal{H1537}{(H8677)}{H1019}, and out of the fields{H7704} of Geba{H1387} and Azmaveth{H5820}: for the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} had builded{H1129}{(H8804)} them villages{H2691} round about{H5439} Jerusalem{H3389}."
Nehemiah,12,30,"And the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881} purified{H2891}{(H8691)} themselves, and purified{H2891}{(H8762)} the people{H5971}, and the gates{H8179}, and the wall{H2346}."
Nehemiah,12,31,"Then I brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063} upon the wall{H2346}, and appointed{H5975}{(H8686)} two{H8147} great{H1419} companies of them that gave thanks{H8426}, whereof one went{H8418} on the right hand{H3225} upon the wall{H2346} toward the dung{H830} gate{H8179}:"
Nehemiah,12,32,"And after{H310} them went{H3212}{(H8799)} Hoshaiah{H1955}, and half{H2677} of the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063},"
Nehemiah,12,33,"And Azariah{H5838}, Ezra{H5830}, and Meshullam{H4918},"
Nehemiah,12,34,"Judah{H3063}, and Benjamin{H1144}, and Shemaiah{H8098}, and Jeremiah{H3414},"
Nehemiah,12,35,"And certain of the priests{H3548}' sons{H1121} with trumpets{H2689}; namely, Zechariah{H2148} the son{H1121} of Jonathan{H3129}, the son{H1121} of Shemaiah{H8098}, the son{H1121} of Mattaniah{H4983}, the son{H1121} of Michaiah{H4320}, the son{H1121} of Zaccur{H2139}, the son{H1121} of Asaph{H623}:"
Nehemiah,12,36,"And his brethren{H251}, Shemaiah{H8098}, and Azarael{H5832}, Milalai{H4450}, Gilalai{H1562}, Maai{H4597}, Nethaneel{H5417}, and Judah{H3063}, Hanani{H2607}, with the musical{H7892} instruments{H3627} of David{H1732} the man{H376} of God{H430}, and Ezra{H5830} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)} before{H6440} them."
Nehemiah,12,37,"And at the fountain{H5869} gate{H8179}, which was over against them, they went up{H5927}{(H8804)} by the stairs{H4609} of the city{H5892} of David{H1732}, at the going up{H4608} of the wall{H2346}, above the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, even unto the water{H4325} gate{H8179} eastward{H4217}."
Nehemiah,12,38,"And the other{H8145} company of them that gave thanks{H8426} went{H1980}{(H8802)} over against{H4136} them, and I after{H310} them, and the half{H2677} of the people{H5971} upon the wall{H2346}, from beyond the tower{H4026} of the furnaces{H8574} even unto the broad{H7342} wall{H2346};"
Nehemiah,12,39,"And from above the gate{H8179} of Ephraim{H669}, and above the old{H3465} gate{H8179}, and above the fish{H1709} gate{H8179}, and the tower{H4026} of Hananeel{H2606}, and the tower{H4026} of Meah{H3968}, even unto the sheep{H6629} gate{H8179}: and they stood still{H5975}{(H8804)} in the prison{H4307} gate{H8179}."
Nehemiah,12,40,"So stood{H5975}{(H8799)} the two{H8147} companies of them that gave thanks{H8426} in the house{H1004} of God{H430}, and I, and the half{H2677} of the rulers{H5461} with me:"
Nehemiah,12,41,"And the priests{H3548}; Eliakim{H471}, Maaseiah{H4641}, Miniamin{H4509}, Michaiah{H4320}, Elioenai{H454}, Zechariah{H2148}, and Hananiah{H2608}, with trumpets{H2689};"
Nehemiah,12,42,"And Maaseiah{H4641}, and Shemaiah{H8098}, and Eleazar{H499}, and Uzzi{H5813}, and Jehohanan{H3076}, and Malchijah{H4441}, and Elam{H5867}, and Ezer{H5829}. And the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} sang loud{H8085}{(H8686)}, with Jezrahiah{H3156} their overseer{H6496}."
Nehemiah,12,43,"Also that day{H3117} they offered{H2076}{(H8799)} great{H1419} sacrifices{H2077}, and rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)}: for God{H430} had made them rejoice{H8055}{(H8765)} with great{H1419} joy{H8057}: the wives{H802} also and the children{H3206} rejoiced{H8055}{(H8804)}: so that the joy{H8057} of Jerusalem{H3389} was heard{H8085}{(H8735)} even afar off{H7350}."
Nehemiah,12,44,"And at that time{H3117} were some{H582} appointed{H6485}{(H8735)} over the chambers{H5393} for the treasures{H214}, for the offerings{H8641}, for the firstfruits{H7225}, and for the tithes{H4643}, to gather{H3664}{(H8800)} into them out of the fields{H7704} of the cities{H5892} the portions{H4521} of the law{H8451} for the priests{H3548} and Levites{H3881}: for Judah{H3063} rejoiced{H8057} for the priests{H3548} and for the Levites{H3881} that waited{H5975}{(H8802)}."
Nehemiah,12,45,"And both the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} and the porters{H7778} kept{H8104}{(H8799)} the ward{H4931} of their God{H430}, and the ward{H4931} of the purification{H2893}, according to the commandment{H4687} of David{H1732}, and of Solomon{H8010} his son{H1121}."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days{H3117} of David{H1732} and Asaph{H623} of old{H6924} there were chief{H7218} of the singers{H7891}{(H8789)}, and songs{H7892} of praise{H8416} and thanksgiving{H3034}{(H8687)} unto God{H430}."
Nehemiah,12,47,"And all Israel{H3478} in the days{H3117} of Zerubbabel{H2216}, and in the days{H3117} of Nehemiah{H5166}, gave{H5414}{(H8802)} the portions{H4521} of the singers{H7891}{(H8789)} and the porters{H7778}, every day{H3117} his portion{H1697}: and they sanctified{H6942}{(H8688)} holy things unto the Levites{H3881}; and the Levites{H3881} sanctified{H6942}{(H8688)} them unto the children{H1121} of Aaron{H175}."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day{H3117} they read{H7121}{(H8738)} in the book{H5612} of Moses{H4872} in the audience{H241} of the people{H5971}; and therein was found{H4672}{(H8738)} written{H3789}{(H8803)}, that the Ammonite{H5984} and the Moabite{H4125} should not come{H935}{(H8799)} into the congregation{H6951} of God{H430} for{H5704} ever{H5769};"
Nehemiah,13,2,"Because they met{H6923}{(H8765)} not the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} with bread{H3899} and with water{H4325}, but hired{H7936}{(H8799)} Balaam{H1109} against them, that he should curse{H7043}{(H8763)} them: howbeit our God{H430} turned{H2015}{(H8799)} the curse{H7045} into a blessing{H1293}."
Nehemiah,13,3,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the law{H8451}, that they separated{H914}{(H8686)} from Israel{H3478} all the mixed multitude{H6154}."
Nehemiah,13,4,"And before{H6440} this, Eliashib{H475} the priest{H3548}, having the oversight{H5414}{(H8803)} of the chamber{H3957} of the house{H1004} of our God{H430}, was allied{H7138} unto Tobiah{H2900}:"
Nehemiah,13,5,"And he had prepared{H6213}{(H8799)} for him a great{H1419} chamber{H3957}, where aforetime{H6440} they laid{H5414}{(H8802)} the meat offerings{H4503}, the frankincense{H3828}, and the vessels{H3627}, and the tithes{H4643} of the corn{H1715}, the new wine{H8492}, and the oil{H3323}, which was commanded{H4687} to be given to the Levites{H3881}, and the singers{H7891}{(H8789)}, and the porters{H7778}; and the offerings{H8641} of the priests{H3548}."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem{H3389}: for in the two{H8147} and thirtieth{H7970} year{H8141} of Artaxerxes{H783} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came{H935}{(H8804)} I unto the king{H4428}, and after{H7093} certain days{H3117} obtained I leave{H7592}{(H8738)} of the king{H4428}:"
Nehemiah,13,7,"And I came{H935}{(H8799)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and understood{H995}{(H8799)} of the evil{H7451} that Eliashib{H475} did{H6213}{(H8804)} for Tobiah{H2900}, in preparing{H6213}{(H8800)} him a chamber{H5393} in the courts{H2691} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}."
Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved{H3415}{(H8799)} me sore{H3966}: therefore I cast forth{H7993}{(H8686)} all the household{H1004} stuff{H3627} of Tobiah{H2900} out of{H2351} the chamber{H3957}.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I commanded{H559}{(H8799)}, and they cleansed{H2891}{(H8762)} the chambers{H3957}: and thither brought I again{H7725}{(H8686)} the vessels{H3627} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}, with the meat offering{H4503} and the frankincense{H3828}."
Nehemiah,13,10,"And I perceived{H3045}{(H8799)} that the portions{H4521} of the Levites{H3881} had not been given{H5414}{(H8738)} them: for the Levites{H3881} and the singers{H7891}{(H8789)}, that did{H6213}{(H8802)} the work{H4399}, were fled{H1272}{(H8799)} every one{H376} to his field{H7704}."
Nehemiah,13,11,"Then contended{H7378}{(H8799)} I with the rulers{H5461}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Why is the house{H1004} of God{H430} forsaken{H5800}{(H8738)}? And I gathered them together{H6908}{(H8762)}, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} them in their place{H5977}."
Nehemiah,13,12,Then brought{H935}{(H8689)} all Judah{H3063} the tithe{H4643} of the corn{H1715} and the new wine{H8492} and the oil{H3323} unto the treasuries{H214}.
Nehemiah,13,13,"And I made treasurers{H686}{(H8799)} over the treasuries{H214}, Shelemiah{H8018} the priest{H3548}, and Zadok{H6659} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, and of the Levites{H3881}, Pedaiah{H6305}: and next to them{H3027} was Hanan{H2605} the son{H1121} of Zaccur{H2139}, the son{H1121} of Mattaniah{H4983}: for they were counted{H2803}{(H8738)} faithful{H539}{(H8737)}, and their office was to distribute{H2505}{(H8800)} unto their brethren{H251}."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} me, O my God{H430}, concerning this, and wipe not out{H4229}{(H8686)} my good{H2617} deeds that I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} for the house{H1004} of my God{H430}, and for the offices{H4929} thereof."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days{H3117} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} I in Judah{H3063} some treading{H1869}{(H8802)} wine presses{H1660} on the sabbath{H7676}, and bringing in{H935}{(H8688)} sheaves{H6194}, and lading{H6006}{(H8802)} asses{H2543}; as also wine{H3196}, grapes{H6025}, and figs{H8384}, and all manner of burdens{H4853}, which they brought{H935}{(H8688)} into Jerusalem{H3389} on the sabbath{H7676} day{H3117}: and I testified{H5749}{(H8686)} against them in the day{H3117} wherein they sold{H4376}{(H8800)} victuals{H6718}."
Nehemiah,13,16,"There dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)} men of Tyre{H6876} also therein, which brought{H935}{(H8688)} fish{H1709}{(H8675)}{H1709}, and all manner of ware{H4377}, and sold{H4376}{(H8802)} on the sabbath{H7676} unto the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063}, and in Jerusalem{H3389}."
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I contended{H7378}{(H8799)} with the nobles{H2715} of Judah{H3063}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What evil{H7451} thing{H1697} is this that ye do{H6213}{(H8802)}, and profane{H2490}{(H8764)} the sabbath{H7676} day{H3117}?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did{H6213}{(H8804)} not your fathers{H1} thus, and did{H935} not our God{H430} bring{H935}{(H8686)} all this evil{H7451} upon us, and upon this city{H5892}? yet ye bring{H935}{(H8686)} more{H3254}{(H8688)} wrath{H2740} upon Israel{H3478} by profaning{H2490}{(H8763)} the sabbath{H7676}."
Nehemiah,13,19,"And it came to pass, that when the gates{H8179} of Jerusalem{H3389} began to be dark{H6751}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the sabbath{H7676}, I commanded{H559}{(H8799)} that the gates{H1817} should be shut{H5462}{(H8735)}, and charged{H559}{(H8799)} that they should not be opened{H6605}{(H8799)} till after{H310} the sabbath{H7676}: and some of my servants{H5288} set{H5975}{(H8689)} I at the gates{H8179}, that there should no burden{H4853} be brought in{H935}{(H8799)} on the sabbath{H7676} day{H3117}."
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants{H7402}{(H8802)} and sellers{H4376}{(H8802)} of all kind of ware{H4465} lodged{H3885}{(H8799)} without{H2351} Jerusalem{H3389} once{H6471} or twice{H8147}.
Nehemiah,13,21,"Then I testified{H5749}{(H8686)} against them, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Why lodge{H3885}{(H8801)} ye about{H5048} the wall{H2346}? if ye do so again{H8138}{(H8799)}, I will lay{H7971}{(H8799)} hands{H3027} on you. From that time{H6256} forth came{H935}{(H8804)} they no more on the sabbath{H7676}."
Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded{H559}{(H8799)} the Levites{H3881} that they should cleanse{H2891}{(H8693)} themselves, and that they should come{H935}{(H8802)} and keep{H8104}{(H8802)} the gates{H8179}, to sanctify{H6942}{(H8763)} the sabbath{H7676} day{H3117}. Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} me, O my God{H430}, concerning this also, and spare{H2347}{(H8798)} me according to the greatness{H7230} of thy mercy{H2617}."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days{H3117} also saw{H7200}{(H8804)} I Jews{H3064} that had married{H3427}{(H8689)} wives{H802} of Ashdod{H796}, of Ammon{H5984}, and of Moab{H4125}:"
Nehemiah,13,24,"And their children{H1121} spake{H1696}{(H8764)} half{H2677} in the speech of Ashdod{H797}, and could{H5234}{(H8688)} not speak{H1696}{(H8763)} in the Jews' language{H3066}, but according to the language{H3956} of each{H5971} people{H5971}."
Nehemiah,13,25,"And I contended{H7378}{(H8799)} with them, and cursed{H7043}{(H8762)} them, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} certain{H582} of them, and plucked off their hair{H4803}{(H8799)}, and made them swear{H7650}{(H8686)} by God{H430}, saying, Ye shall not give{H5414}{(H8799)} your daughters{H1323} unto their sons{H1121}, nor take{H5375}{(H8799)} their daughters{H1323} unto your sons{H1121}, or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Solomon{H8010} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} sin{H2398}{(H8804)} by these things? yet among many{H7227} nations{H1471} was there no king{H4428} like him, who was beloved{H157}{(H8803)} of his God{H430}, and God{H430} made{H5414}{(H8799)} him king{H4428} over all Israel{H3478}: nevertheless even him{H1571} did outlandish{H5237} women{H802} cause to sin{H2398}{(H8689)}."
Nehemiah,13,27,"Shall we then hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto you to do{H6213}{(H8800)} all this great{H1419} evil{H7451}, to transgress{H4603}{(H8800)} against our God{H430} in marrying{H3427}{(H8687)} strange{H5237} wives{H802}?"
Nehemiah,13,28,"And one of the sons{H1121} of Joiada{H3111}, the son{H1121} of Eliashib{H475} the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, was son in law{H2860} to Sanballat{H5571} the Horonite{H2772}: therefore I chased{H1272}{(H8686)} him from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} them, O my God{H430}, because they have defiled{H1352} the priesthood{H3550}, and the covenant{H1285} of the priesthood{H3550}, and of the Levites{H3881}."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus cleansed{H2891}{(H8765)} I them from all strangers{H5236}, and appointed{H5975}{(H8686)} the wards{H4931} of the priests{H3548} and the Levites{H3881}, every one{H376} in his business{H4399};"
Nehemiah,13,31,"And for the wood{H6086} offering{H7133}, at times{H6256} appointed{H2163}{(H8794)}, and for the firstfruits{H1061}. Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} me, O my God{H430}, for good{H2896}."
Esther,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days{H3117} of Ahasuerus{H325},(this is Ahasuerus{H325} which reigned{H4427}{(H8802)}, from India{H1912} even unto Ethiopia{H3568}, over an hundred{H3967} and seven{H7651} and twenty{H6242} provinces{H4082}:)"
Esther,1,2,"That in those days{H3117}, when the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} sat{H3427}{(H8800)} on the throne{H3678} of his kingdom{H4438}, which was in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002},"
Esther,1,3,"In the third{H7969} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, he made{H6213}{(H8804)} a feast{H4960} unto all his princes{H8269} and his servants{H5650}; the power{H2428} of Persia{H6539} and Media{H4074}, the nobles{H6579} and princes{H8269} of the provinces{H4082}, being before{H6440} him:"
Esther,1,4,"When he shewed{H7200}{(H8687)} the riches{H6239} of his glorious{H3519} kingdom{H4438} and the honour{H3366} of his excellent{H8597} majesty{H1420} many{H7227} days{H3117}, even an hundred{H3967} and fourscore{H8084} days{H3117}."
Esther,1,5,"And when these days{H3117} were expired{H4390}{(H8800)}, the king{H4428} made{H6213}{(H8804)} a feast{H4960} unto all the people{H5971} that were present{H4672}{(H8737)} in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002}, both unto great{H1419} and small{H6996}, seven{H7651} days{H3117}, in the court{H2691} of the garden{H1594} of the king's{H4428} palace{H1055};"
Esther,1,6,"Where were white{H2353}, green{H3768}, and blue{H8504}, hangings, fastened{H270}{(H8803)} with cords{H2256} of fine linen{H948} and purple{H713} to silver{H3701} rings{H1550} and pillars{H5982} of marble{H8336}: the beds{H4296} were of gold{H2091} and silver{H3701}, upon a pavement{H7531} of red{H923}, and blue{H8504}, and white{H1858}, and black{H5508}, marble{H8336}."
Esther,1,7,"And they gave them drink{H8248}{(H8687)} in vessels{H3627} of gold{H2091},(the vessels{H3627} being diverse{H8138}{(H8802)} one from another{H3627},) and royal{H4438} wine{H3196} in abundance{H7227}, according to the state{H3027} of the king{H4428}."
Esther,1,8,"And the drinking{H8360} was according to the law{H1881}; none did compel{H597}{(H8802)}: for so the king{H4428} had appointed{H3245}{(H8765)} to all the officers{H7227} of his house{H1004}, that they should do{H6213}{(H8800)} according to every man's{H376} pleasure{H7522}."
Esther,1,9,Also Vashti{H2060} the queen{H4436} made{H6213}{(H8804)} a feast{H4960} for the women{H802} in the royal{H4438} house{H1004} which belonged to king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh{H7637} day{H3117}, when the heart{H3820} of the king{H4428} was merry{H2896} with wine{H3196}, he commanded{H559}{(H8804)} Mehuman{H4104}, Biztha{H968}, Harbona{H2726}, Bigtha{H903}, and Abagtha{H5}, Zethar{H2242}, and Carcas{H3752}, the seven{H7651} chamberlains{H5631} that served{H8334}{(H8764)} in the presence{H6440} of Ahasuerus{H325} the king{H4428},"
Esther,1,11,"To bring{H935}{(H8687)} Vashti{H2060} the queen{H4436} before{H6440} the king{H4428} with the crown{H3804} royal{H4438}, to shew{H7200}{(H8687)} the people{H5971} and the princes{H8269} her beauty{H3308}: for she was fair{H2896} to look on{H4758}."
Esther,1,12,"But the queen{H4436} Vashti{H2060} refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to come{H935}{(H8800)} at the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697} by{H3027} his chamberlains{H5631}: therefore was the king{H4428} very{H3966} wroth{H7107}{(H8799)}, and his anger{H2534} burned{H1197}{(H8804)} in him."
Esther,1,13,"Then the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} to the wise men{H2450}, which knew{H3045}{(H8802)} the times{H6256},(for so was the king's{H4428} manner{H1697} toward{H6440} all that knew{H3045}{(H8802)} law{H1881} and judgment{H1779}:"
Esther,1,14,"And the next{H7138} unto him was Carshena{H3771}, Shethar{H8369}, Admatha{H133}, Tarshish{H8659}, Meres{H4825}, Marsena{H4826}, and Memucan{H4462}, the seven{H7651} princes{H8269} of Persia{H6539} and Media{H4074}, which saw{H7200}{(H8802)} the king's{H4428} face{H6440}, and which sat{H3427}{(H8802)} the first{H7223} in the kingdom{H4438};)"
Esther,1,15,"What shall we do{H6213}{(H8800)} unto the queen{H4436} Vashti{H2060} according to law{H1881}, because she hath not performed{H6213}{(H8804)} the commandment{H3982} of the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} by{H3027} the chamberlains{H5631}?"
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan{H4462} answered{H559}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428} and the princes{H8269}, Vashti{H2060} the queen{H4436} hath not done wrong{H5753}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428} only, but also to all the princes{H8269}, and to all the people{H5971} that are in all the provinces{H4082} of the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}."
Esther,1,17,"For this deed{H1697} of the queen{H4436} shall come abroad{H3318}{(H8799)} unto all women{H802}, so that they shall despise{H959}{(H8687)} their husbands{H1167} in their eyes{H5869}, when it shall be reported{H559}{(H8800)}, The king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} commanded{H559}{(H8804)} Vashti{H2060} the queen{H4436} to be brought in{H935}{(H8687)} before{H6440} him, but she came{H935}{(H8804)} not."
Esther,1,18,"Likewise shall the ladies{H8282} of Persia{H6539} and Media{H4074} say{H559}{(H8799)} this day{H3117} unto all the king's{H4428} princes{H8269}, which have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} of the deed{H1697} of the queen{H4436}. Thus shall there arise too much{H1767} contempt{H963} and wrath{H7110}."
Esther,1,19,"If it please{H2895}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, let there go{H3318}{(H8799)} a royal{H4438} commandment{H1697} from him{H6440}, and let it be written{H3789}{(H8735)} among the laws{H1881} of the Persians{H6539} and the Medes{H4074}, that it be not altered{H5674}{(H8799)}, That Vashti{H2060} come{H935}{(H8799)} no more before{H6440} king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}; and let the king{H4428} give{H5414}{(H8799)} her royal estate{H4438} unto another{H7468} that is better{H2896} than she."
Esther,1,20,"And when the king's{H4428} decree{H6599} which he shall make{H6213}{(H8799)} shall be published{H8085}{(H8738)} throughout all his empire{H4438},(for it is great{H7227},) all the wives{H802} shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} to their husbands{H1167} honour{H3366}, both to great{H1419} and small{H6996}."
Esther,1,21,And the saying{H1697} pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} the king{H4428} and the princes{H8269}; and the king{H4428} did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to the word{H1697} of Memucan{H4462}:
Esther,1,22,"For he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} letters{H5612} into all the king's{H4428} provinces{H4082}, into every province{H4082} according to the writing{H3791} thereof, and to every people{H5971} after their language{H3956}, that every man{H376} should bear rule{H8323}{(H8802)} in his own house{H1004}, and that it should be published{H1696}{(H8764)} according to the language{H3956} of every people{H5971}."
Esther,2,1,"After{H310} these things{H1697}, when the wrath{H2534} of king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} was appeased{H7918}{(H8800)}, he remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} Vashti{H2060}, and what she had done{H6213}{(H8804)}, and what was decreed{H1504}{(H8738)} against her."
Esther,2,2,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king's{H4428} servants{H5288} that ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} unto him, Let there be fair{H2896}{H4758} young{H5291} virgins{H1330} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} for the king{H4428}:"
Esther,2,3,"And let the king{H4428} appoint{H6485}{(H8686)} officers{H6496} in all the provinces{H4082} of his kingdom{H4438}, that they may gather together{H6908}{(H8799)} all the fair{H2896}{H4758} young{H5291} virgins{H1330} unto Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002}, to the house{H1004} of the women{H802}, unto the custody{H3027} of Hege{H1896} the king's{H4428} chamberlain{H5631}, keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of the women{H802}; and let their things for purification{H8562} be given{H5414}{(H8800)} them:"
Esther,2,4,And let the maiden{H5291} which pleaseth{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} the king{H4428} be queen{H4427}{(H8799)} instead of Vashti{H2060}. And the thing{H1697} pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} the king{H4428}; and he did so{H6213}{(H8799)}.
Esther,2,5,"Now in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002} there was a certain{H376} Jew{H3064}, whose name{H8034} was Mordecai{H4782}, the son{H1121} of Jair{H2971}, the son{H1121} of Shimei{H8096}, the son{H1121} of Kish{H7027}, a Benjamite{H1145};"
Esther,2,6,"Who had been carried away{H1540}{(H8717)} from Jerusalem{H3389} with the captivity{H1473} which had been carried away{H1540}{(H8717)} with Jeconiah{H3204} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, whom Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} had carried away{H1540}{(H8689)}."
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up{H539}{(H8802)} Hadassah{H1919}, that is, Esther{H635}, his uncle's{H1730} daughter{H1323}: for she had neither father{H1} nor mother{H517}, and the maid{H5291} was fair{H3303}{H8389} and beautiful{H2896}{H4758}; whom Mordecai{H4782}, when her father{H1} and mother{H517} were dead{H4194}, took{H3947}{(H8804)} for his own daughter{H1323}."
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697} and his decree{H1881} was heard{H8085}{(H8736)}, and when many{H7227} maidens{H5291} were gathered together{H6908}{(H8736)} unto Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002}, to the custody{H3027} of Hegai{H1896}, that Esther{H635} was brought{H3947}{(H8735)} also unto the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, to the custody{H3027} of Hegai{H1896}, keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of the women{H802}."
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden{H5291} pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H5869} him, and she obtained{H5375}{(H8799)} kindness{H2617} of him{H6440}; and he speedily{H926}{(H8762)} gave{H5414}{(H8800)} her her things for purification{H8562}, with such things as belonged{H4490} to her, and seven{H7651} maidens{H5291}, which were meet{H7200}{(H8803)} to be given{H5414}{(H8800)} her, out of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}: and he preferred{H8138}{(H8762)} her and her maids{H5291} unto the best{H2896} place of the house{H1004} of the women{H802}."
Esther,2,10,Esther{H635} had not shewed{H5046}{(H8689)} her people{H5971} nor her kindred{H4138}: for Mordecai{H4782} had charged{H6680}{(H8765)} her that she should not shew{H5046}{(H8686)} it.
Esther,2,11,"And Mordecai{H4782} walked{H1980}{(H8693)} every day{H3117} before{H6440} the court{H2691} of the women's{H802} house{H1004}, to know{H3045}{(H8800)} how Esther{H635} did{H7965}, and what should become{H6213}{(H8735)} of her."
Esther,2,12,"Now when every maid's{H5291} turn{H8447} was come{H5060}{(H8687)} to go in{H935}{(H8800)} to king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, after{H7093} that she had been twelve{H8147}{H6240} months{H2320}, according to the manner{H1881} of the women{H802},(for so were the days{H3117} of their purifications{H4795} accomplished{H4390}{(H8799)}, to wit, six{H8337} months{H2320} with oil{H8081} of myrrh{H4753}, and six{H8337} months{H2320} with sweet odours{H1314}, and with other things for the purifying{H8562} of the women{H802};)"
Esther,2,13,Then thus came{H935}{(H8802)} every maiden{H5291} unto the king{H4428}; whatsoever she desired{H559}{(H8799)} was given{H5414}{(H8735)} her to go{H935}{(H8800)} with her out of the house{H1004} of the women{H802} unto the king's{H4428} house{H1004}.
Esther,2,14,"In the evening{H6153} she went{H935}{(H8802)}, and on the morrow{H1242} she returned{H7725}{(H8802)} into the second{H8145} house{H1004} of the women{H802}, to the custody{H3027} of Shaashgaz{H8190}, the king's{H4428} chamberlain{H5631}, which kept{H8104}{(H8802)} the concubines{H6370}: she came in{H935}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} no more, except the king{H4428} delighted{H2654}{(H8804)} in her, and that she were called{H7121}{(H8738)} by name{H8034}."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn{H8447} of Esther{H635}, the daughter{H1323} of Abihail{H32} the uncle{H1730} of Mordecai{H4782}, who had taken{H3947}{(H8804)} her for his daughter{H1323}, was come{H5060}{(H8687)} to go in{H935}{(H8800)} unto the king{H4428}, she required{H1245}{(H8765)} nothing{H1697} but what Hegai{H1896} the king's{H4428} chamberlain{H5631}, the keeper{H8104}{(H8802)} of the women{H802}, appointed{H559}{(H8799)}. And Esther{H635} obtained{H5375}{(H8802)} favour{H2580} in the sight{H5869} of all them that looked{H7200}{(H8802)} upon her."
Esther,2,16,"So Esther{H635} was taken{H3947}{(H8735)} unto king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} into his house{H1004} royal{H4438} in the tenth{H6224} month{H2320}, which is the month{H2320} Tebeth{H2887}, in the seventh{H7651} year{H8141} of his reign{H4438}."
Esther,2,17,"And the king{H4428} loved{H157}{(H8799)} Esther{H635} above all the women{H802}, and she obtained{H5375}{(H8799)} grace{H2580} and favour{H2617} in his sight{H6440} more than all the virgins{H1330}; so that he set{H7760}{(H8799)} the royal{H4438} crown{H3804} upon her head{H7218}, and made her queen{H4427}{(H8686)} instead of Vashti{H2060}."
Esther,2,18,"Then the king{H4428} made{H6213}{(H8799)} a great{H1419} feast{H4960} unto all his princes{H8269} and his servants{H5650}, even Esther's{H635} feast{H4960}; and he made{H6213}{(H8804)} a release{H2010} to the provinces{H4082}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} gifts{H4864}, according to the state{H3027} of the king{H4428}."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins{H1330} were gathered together{H6908}{(H8736)} the second time{H8145}, then Mordecai{H4782} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}."
Esther,2,20,"Esther{H635} had not yet shewed{H5046}{(H8688)} her kindred{H4138} nor her people{H5971}; as Mordecai{H4782} had charged{H6680}{(H8765)} her: for Esther{H635} did{H6213}{(H8802)} the commandment{H3982} of Mordecai{H4782}, like as when she was brought up{H545} with him."
Esther,2,21,"In those days{H3117}, while Mordecai{H4782} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}, two{H8147} of the king's{H4428} chamberlains{H5631}, Bigthan{H904} and Teresh{H8657}, of those which kept{H8104}{(H8802)} the door{H5592}, were wroth{H7107}{(H8804)}, and sought{H1245}{(H8762)} to lay{H7971}{(H8800)} hand{H3027} on the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}."
Esther,2,22,"And the thing{H1697} was known{H3045}{(H8735)} to Mordecai{H4782}, who told{H5046}{(H8686)} it unto Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}; and Esther{H635} certified{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} thereof in Mordecai's{H4782} name{H8034}."
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition{H1245}{(H8792)} was made of the matter{H1697}, it was found out{H4672}{(H8735)}; therefore they were both{H8147} hanged{H8518}{(H8735)} on a tree{H6086}: and it was written{H3789}{(H8735)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
Esther,3,1,"After{H310} these things{H1697} did king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} promote{H1431}{(H8765)} Haman{H2001} the son{H1121} of Hammedatha{H4099} the Agagite{H91}, and advanced{H5375}{(H8762)} him, and set{H7760}{(H8799)} his seat{H3678} above all the princes{H8269} that were with him."
Esther,3,2,"And all the king's{H4428} servants{H5650}, that were in the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}, bowed{H3766}{(H8802)}, and reverenced{H7812}{(H8693)} Haman{H2001}: for the king{H4428} had so commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} concerning him. But Mordecai{H4782} bowed{H3766}{(H8799)} not, nor did him reverence{H7812}{(H8691)}."
Esther,3,3,"Then the king's{H4428} servants{H5650}, which were in the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}, said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Mordecai{H4782}, Why transgressest{H5674}{(H8802)} thou the king's{H4428} commandment{H4687}?"
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake{H559}{(H8800)} daily{H3117}{H3117} unto him, and he hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto them, that they told{H5046}{(H8686)} Haman{H2001}, to see{H7200}{(H8800)} whether Mordecai's{H4782} matters{H1697} would stand{H5975}{(H8799)}: for he had told{H5046}{(H8689)} them that he was a Jew{H3064}."
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman{H2001} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that Mordecai{H4782} bowed{H3766}{(H8802)} not, nor did him reverence{H7812}{(H8693)}, then was Haman{H2001} full{H4390}{(H8735)} of wrath{H2534}."
Esther,3,6,"And he thought{H5869} scorn{H959}{(H8799)} to lay{H7971}{(H8800)} hands{H3027} on Mordecai{H4782} alone; for they had shewed{H5046}{(H8689)} him the people{H5971} of Mordecai{H4782}: wherefore Haman{H2001} sought{H1245}{(H8762)} to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} all the Jews{H3064} that were throughout the whole kingdom{H4438} of Ahasuerus{H325}, even the people{H5971} of Mordecai{H4782}."
Esther,3,7,"In the first{H7223} month{H2320}, that is, the month{H2320} Nisan{H5212}, in the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, they cast{H5307}{(H8689)} Pur{H6332}, that is, the lot{H1486}, before{H6440} Haman{H2001} from day{H3117} to day{H3117}, and from month{H2320} to month{H2320}, to the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} month, that is, the month{H2320} Adar{H143}."
Esther,3,8,"And Haman{H2001} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, There is{H3426} a certain{H259} people{H5971} scattered abroad{H6340}{(H8794)} and dispersed{H6504}{(H8794)} among the people{H5971} in all the provinces{H4082} of thy kingdom{H4438}; and their laws{H1881} are diverse{H8138}{(H8802)} from all people{H5971}; neither keep{H6213}{(H8802)} they the king's{H4428} laws{H1881}: therefore it is not for the king's{H4428} profit{H7737}{(H8802)} to suffer{H3240}{(H8687)} them."
Esther,3,9,"If it please{H2895}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, let it be written{H3789}{(H8735)} that they may be destroyed{H6}{(H8763)}: and I will pay{H8254}{(H8799)} ten{H6235} thousand{H505} talents{H3603} of silver{H3701} to the hands{H3027} of those that have the charge{H6213}{(H8802)} of the business{H4399}, to bring{H935}{(H8687)} it into the king's{H4428} treasuries{H1595}."
Esther,3,10,"And the king{H4428} took{H5493}{(H8686)} his ring{H2885} from his hand{H3027}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto Haman{H2001} the son{H1121} of Hammedatha{H4099} the Agagite{H91}, the Jews{H3064}' enemy{H6887}{(H8802)}."
Esther,3,11,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Haman{H2001}, The silver{H3701} is given{H5414}{(H8803)} to thee, the people{H5971} also, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} with them as it seemeth{H5869} good{H2896} to thee."
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king's{H4428} scribes{H5608}{(H8802)} called{H7121}{(H8735)} on the thirteenth{H7969}{H6240} day{H3117} of the first{H7223} month{H2320}, and there was written{H3789}{(H8735)} according to all that Haman{H2001} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} unto the king's{H4428} lieutenants{H323}, and to the governors{H6346} that were over every province{H4082}, and to the rulers{H8269} of every people{H5971} of every province{H4082} according to the writing{H3791} thereof, and to every people{H5971} after their language{H3956}; in the name{H8034} of king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} was it written{H3789}{(H8737)}, and sealed{H2856}{(H8738)} with the king's{H4428} ring{H2885}."
Esther,3,13,"And the letters{H5612} were sent{H7971}{(H8736)} by{H3027} posts{H7323}{(H8801)} into all the king's{H4428} provinces{H4082}, to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)}, to kill{H2026}{(H8800)}, and to cause to perish{H6}{(H8763)}, all Jews{H3064}, both young{H5288} and old{H2205}, little children{H2945} and women{H802}, in one{H259} day{H3117}, even upon the thirteenth{H7969}{H6240} day of the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} month{H2320}, which is the month{H2320} Adar{H143}, and to take the spoil{H7998} of them for a prey{H962}{(H8800)}."
Esther,3,14,"The copy{H6572} of the writing{H3791} for a commandment{H1881} to be given{H5414}{(H8736)} in every province{H4082} was published{H1540}{(H8803)} unto all people{H5971}, that they should be ready{H6264} against that day{H3117}."
Esther,3,15,"The posts{H7323}{(H8801)} went out{H3318}{(H8804)}, being hastened{H1765}{(H8803)} by the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697}, and the decree{H1881} was given{H5414}{(H8738)} in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002}. And the king{H4428} and Haman{H2001} sat down{H3427}{(H8804)} to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}; but the city{H5892} Shushan{H7800} was perplexed{H943}{(H8737)}."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai{H4782} perceived{H3045}{(H8804)} all that was done{H6213}{(H8738)}, Mordecai{H4782} rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his clothes{H899}, and put on{H3847}{(H8799)} sackcloth{H8242} with ashes{H665}, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)} into the midst{H8432} of the city{H5892}, and cried{H2199}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} and a bitter{H4751} cry{H2201};"
Esther,4,2,And came{H935}{(H8799)} even before{H6440} the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}: for none might enter{H935}{(H8800)} into the king's{H4428} gate{H8179} clothed{H3830} with sackcloth{H8242}.
Esther,4,3,"And in every province{H4082}, whithersoever{H4725} the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697} and his decree{H1881} came{H5060}{(H8688)}, there was great{H1419} mourning{H60} among the Jews{H3064}, and fasting{H6685}, and weeping{H1065}, and wailing{H4553}; and many{H7227} lay{H3331}{(H8714)} in sackcloth{H8242} and ashes{H665}."
Esther,4,4,"So Esther's{H635} maids{H5291} and her chamberlains{H5631} came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} it her. Then was the queen{H4436} exceedingly{H3966} grieved{H2342}{(H8698)}; and she sent{H7971}{(H8799)} raiment{H899} to clothe{H3847}{(H8687)} Mordecai{H4782}, and to take away{H5493}{(H8687)} his sackcloth{H8242} from him: but he received{H6901}{(H8765)} it not."
Esther,4,5,"Then called{H7121}{(H8799)} Esther{H635} for Hatach{H2047}, one of the king's{H4428} chamberlains{H5631}, whom he had appointed{H5975}{(H8689)} to attend{H6440} upon her, and gave him a commandment{H6680}{(H8762)} to Mordecai{H4782}, to know{H3045}{(H8800)} what it was, and why it was."
Esther,4,6,"So Hatach{H2047} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} to Mordecai{H4782} unto the street{H7339} of the city{H5892}, which was before{H6440} the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}."
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai{H4782} told{H5046}{(H8686)} him of all that had happened{H7136}{(H8804)} unto him, and of the sum{H6575} of the money{H3701} that Haman{H2001} had promised{H559}{(H8804)} to pay{H8254}{(H8800)} to the king's{H4428} treasuries{H1595} for the Jews{H3064}, to destroy{H6}{(H8763)} them."
Esther,4,8,"Also he gave{H5414}{(H8804)} him the copy{H6572} of the writing{H3791} of the decree{H1881} that was given{H5414}{(H8738)} at Shushan{H7800} to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} them, to shew{H7200}{(H8687)} it unto Esther{H635}, and to declare{H5046}{(H8687)} it unto her, and to charge{H6680}{(H8763)} her that she should go in{H935}{(H8800)} unto the king{H4428}, to make supplication{H2603}{(H8692)} unto him, and to make request{H1245}{(H8763)} before{H6440} him for her people{H5971}."
Esther,4,9,And Hatach{H2047} came{H935}{(H8799)} and told{H5046}{(H8686)} Esther{H635} the words{H1697} of Mordecai{H4782}.
Esther,4,10,"Again Esther{H635} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto Hatach{H2047}, and gave him commandment{H6680}{(H8762)} unto Mordecai{H4782};"
Esther,4,11,"All the king's{H4428} servants{H5650}, and the people{H5971} of the king's{H4428} provinces{H4082}, do know{H3045}{(H8802)}, that whosoever, whether man{H376} or woman{H802}, shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} into the inner{H6442} court{H2691}, who is not called{H7121}{(H8735)}, there is one{H259} law{H1881} of his to put him to death{H4191}{(H8687)}, except{H905} such to whom the king{H4428} shall hold out{H3447}{(H8686)} the golden{H2091} sceptre{H8275}, that he may live{H2421}{(H8804)}: but I have not been called{H7121}{(H8738)} to come in{H935}{(H8800)} unto the king{H4428} these thirty{H7970} days{H3117}."
Esther,4,12,And they told{H5046}{(H8686)} to Mordecai{H4782} Esther's{H635} words{H1697}.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai{H4782} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} to answer{H7725}{(H8687)} Esther{H635}, Think{H1819}{(H8762)} not with thyself{H5315} that thou shalt escape{H4422}{(H8736)} in the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, more than all the Jews{H3064}."
Esther,4,14,"For if thou altogether{H2790}{(H8687)} holdest thy peace{H2790}{(H8686)} at this time{H6256}, then shall there enlargement{H7305} and deliverance{H2020} arise{H5975}{(H8799)} to the Jews{H3064} from another{H312} place{H4725}; but thou and thy father's{H1} house{H1004} shall be destroyed{H6}{(H8799)}: and who knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} whether thou art come{H5060}{(H8689)} to the kingdom{H4438} for such a time{H6256} as this?"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther{H635} bade{H559}{(H8799)} them return{H7725}{(H8687)} Mordecai{H4782} this answer,"
Esther,4,16,"Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, gather together{H3664}{(H8798)} all the Jews{H3064} that are present{H4672}{(H8737)} in Shushan{H7800}, and fast{H6684}{(H8798)} ye for me, and neither eat{H398}{(H8799)} nor drink{H8354}{(H8799)} three{H7969} days{H3117}, night{H3915} or day{H3117}: I also and my maidens{H5291} will fast{H6684}{(H8799)} likewise; and so{H3651} will I go{H935}{(H8799)} in unto the king{H4428}, which is not according to the law{H1881}: and if I perish{H6}{(H8804)}, I perish{H6}{(H8804)}."
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai{H4782} went his way{H5674}{(H8799)}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to all that Esther{H635} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him."
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third{H7992} day{H3117}, that Esther{H635} put on{H3847}{(H8799)} her royal{H4438} apparel, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the inner{H6442} court{H2691} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, over against{H5227} the king's{H4428} house{H1004}: and the king{H4428} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} upon his royal{H4438} throne{H3678} in the royal{H4438} house{H1004}, over against{H5227} the gate{H6607} of the house{H1004}."
Esther,5,2,"And it was so, when the king{H4428} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} Esther{H635} the queen{H4436} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} in the court{H2691}, that she obtained{H5375}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in his sight{H5869}: and the king{H4428} held out{H3447}{(H8686)} to Esther{H635} the golden{H2091} sceptre{H8275} that was in his hand{H3027}. So Esther{H635} drew near{H7126}{(H8799)}, and touched{H5060}{(H8799)} the top{H7218} of the sceptre{H8275}."
Esther,5,3,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} unto her, What wilt thou, queen{H4436} Esther{H635}? and what is thy request{H1246}? it shall be even given{H5414}{(H8735)} thee to the half{H2677} of the kingdom{H4438}."
Esther,5,4,"And Esther{H635} answered{H559}{(H8799)}, If it seem good{H2895}{(H8804)} unto the king{H4428}, let the king{H4428} and Haman{H2001} come{H935}{(H8799)} this day{H3117} unto the banquet{H4960} that I have prepared{H6213}{(H8804)} for him."
Esther,5,5,"Then the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Cause Haman{H2001} to make haste{H4116}{(H8761)}, that he may do{H6213}{(H8800)} as Esther{H635} hath said{H1697}. So the king{H4428} and Haman{H2001} came{H935}{(H8799)} to the banquet{H4960} that Esther{H635} had prepared{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Esther,5,6,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Esther{H635} at the banquet{H4960} of wine{H3196}, What is thy petition{H7596}? and it shall be granted{H5414}{(H8735)} thee: and what is thy request{H1246}? even to the half{H2677} of the kingdom{H4438} it shall be performed{H6213}{(H8735)}."
Esther,5,7,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Esther{H635}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, My petition{H7596} and my request{H1246} is;"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in the sight{H5869} of the king{H4428}, and if it please{H2895}{(H8804)} the king{H4428} to grant{H5414}{(H8800)} my petition{H7596}, and to perform{H6213}{(H8800)} my request{H1246}, let the king{H4428} and Haman{H2001} come{H935}{(H8799)} to the banquet{H4960} that I shall prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} for them, and I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} to morrow{H4279} as the king{H4428} hath said{H1697}."
Esther,5,9,"Then went{H3318} Haman{H2001} forth{H3318}{(H8799)} that day{H3117} joyful{H8056} and with a glad{H2896} heart{H3820}: but when Haman{H2001} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} Mordecai{H4782} in the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}, that he stood not up{H6965}{(H8804)}, nor moved{H2111}{(H8804)} for him, he{H2001} was full{H4390}{(H8735)} of indignation{H2534} against Mordecai{H4782}."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman{H2001} refrained{H662}{(H8691)} himself: and when he came{H935}{(H8799)} home{H1004}, he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and called{H935}{(H8686)} for his friends{H157}{(H8802)}, and Zeresh{H2238} his wife{H802}."
Esther,5,11,"And Haman{H2001} told{H5608}{(H8762)} them of the glory{H3519} of his riches{H6239}, and the multitude{H7230} of his children{H1121}, and all the things wherein the king{H4428} had promoted{H1431}{(H8765)} him, and how he had advanced{H5375}{(H8765)} him above the princes{H8269} and servants{H5650} of the king{H4428}."
Esther,5,12,"Haman{H2001} said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover, Yea, Esther{H635} the queen{H4436} did let no man come in{H935}{(H8689)} with the king{H4428} unto the banquet{H4960} that she had prepared{H6213}{(H8804)} but myself; and to morrow{H4279} am I invited{H7121}{(H8803)} unto her also with the king{H4428}."
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this availeth{H7737}{(H8802)} me nothing, so long as{H6256} I see{H7200}{(H8802)} Mordecai{H4782} the Jew{H3064} sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} at the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}."
Esther,5,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Zeresh{H2238} his wife{H802} and all his friends{H157}{(H8802)} unto him, Let a gallows{H6086} be made{H6213}{(H8799)} of fifty{H2572} cubits{H520} high{H1364}, and to morrow{H1242} speak{H559}{(H8798)} thou unto the king{H4428} that Mordecai{H4782} may be hanged{H8518}{(H8799)} thereon: then go{H935}{(H8798)} thou in merrily{H8056} with the king{H4428} unto the banquet{H4960}. And the thing{H1697} pleased{H3190}{(H8799)}{H6440} Haman{H2001}; and he caused{H6213} the gallows{H6086} to be made{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Esther,6,1,"On that night{H3915} could not{H5074}{(H8804)} the king{H4428} sleep{H8142}, and he commanded{H559}{(H8799)} to bring{H935}{(H8687)} the book{H5612} of records{H2146} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117}; and they were read{H7121}{(H8737)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
Esther,6,2,"And it was found{H4672}{(H8735)} written{H3789}{(H8803)}, that Mordecai{H4782} had told{H5046}{(H8689)} of Bigthana{H904} and Teresh{H8657}, two{H8147} of the king's{H4428} chamberlains{H5631}, the keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the door{H5592}, who sought{H1245}{(H8765)} to lay{H7971}{(H8800)} hand{H3027} on the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}."
Esther,6,3,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, What honour{H3366} and dignity{H1420} hath been done{H6213}{(H8738)} to Mordecai{H4782} for this? Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king's{H4428} servants{H5288} that ministered{H8334}{(H8764)} unto him, There is nothing{H1697} done{H6213}{(H8738)} for him."
Esther,6,4,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Who is in the court{H2691}? Now Haman{H2001} was come{H935}{(H8804)} into the outward{H2435} court{H2691} of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, to speak{H559}{(H8800)} unto the king{H4428} to hang{H8518}{(H8800)} Mordecai{H4782} on the gallows{H6086} that he had prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} for him."
Esther,6,5,"And the king's{H4428} servants{H5288} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Behold, Haman{H2001} standeth{H5975}{(H8802)} in the court{H2691}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let him come in{H935}{(H8799)}."
Esther,6,6,"So Haman{H2001} came in{H935}{(H8799)}. And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What shall be done{H6213}{(H8800)} unto the man{H376} whom the king{H4428} delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} to honour{H3366}? Now Haman{H2001} thought{H559}{(H8799)} in his heart{H3820}, To whom would the king{H4428} delight{H2654}{(H8799)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} honour{H3366} more{H3148} than to myself?"
Esther,6,7,"And Haman{H2001} answered{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, For the man{H376} whom the king{H4428} delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} to honour{H3366},"
Esther,6,8,"Let the royal{H4438} apparel{H3830} be brought{H935}{(H8686)} which the king{H4428} useth to wear{H3847}{(H8804)}, and the horse{H5483} that the king{H4428} rideth{H7392}{(H8804)} upon, and the crown{H3804} royal{H4438} which is set{H5414}{(H8738)} upon his head{H7218}:"
Esther,6,9,"And let this apparel{H3830} and horse{H5483} be delivered{H5414}{(H8800)} to the hand{H3027} of one{H376} of the king's{H4428} most noble{H6579} princes{H8269}, that they may array{H3847}{(H8689)} the man{H376} withal whom the king{H4428} delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} to honour{H3366}, and bring{H7392}{(H8689)} him on horseback{H5483} through the street{H7339} of the city{H5892}, and proclaim{H7121}{(H8804)} before{H6440} him, Thus shall it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} to the man{H376} whom the king{H4428} delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} to honour{H3366}."
Esther,6,10,"Then the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Haman{H2001}, Make haste{H4116}{(H8761)}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} the apparel{H3830} and the horse{H5483}, as thou hast said{H1696}{(H8765)}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} even so to Mordecai{H4782} the Jew{H3064}, that sitteth{H3427}{(H8802)} at the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}: let nothing{H1697} fail{H5307}{(H8686)} of all that thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Esther,6,11,"Then took{H3947}{(H8799)} Haman{H2001} the apparel{H3830} and the horse{H5483}, and arrayed{H3847}{(H8686)} Mordecai{H4782}, and brought him on horseback{H7392}{(H8686)} through the street{H7339} of the city{H5892}, and proclaimed{H7121}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him, Thus shall it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} unto the man{H376} whom the king{H4428} delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} to honour{H3366}."
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai{H4782} came again{H7725}{(H8799)} to the king's{H4428} gate{H8179}. But Haman{H2001} hasted{H1765}{(H8738)} to his house{H1004} mourning{H57}, and having his head{H7218} covered{H2645}{(H8802)}."
Esther,6,13,"And Haman{H2001} told{H5608}{(H8762)} Zeresh{H2238} his wife{H802} and all his friends{H157}{(H8802)} every thing that had befallen{H7136}{(H8804)} him. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} his wise men{H2450} and Zeresh{H2238} his wife{H802} unto him, If Mordecai{H4782} be of the seed{H2233} of the Jews{H3064}, before{H6440} whom thou hast begun{H2490}{(H8689)} to fall{H5307}{(H8800)}, thou shalt not prevail{H3201}{(H8799)} against him, but shalt surely{H5307}{(H8800)} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him."
Esther,6,14,"And while they were yet talking{H1696}{(H8764)} with him, came{H5060}{(H8689)} the king's{H4428} chamberlains{H5631}, and hasted{H926}{(H8686)} to bring{H935}{(H8687)} Haman{H2001} unto the banquet{H4960} that Esther{H635} had prepared{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Esther,7,1,So the king{H4428} and Haman{H2001} came{H935}{(H8799)} to banquet{H8354}{(H8800)} with Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}.
Esther,7,2,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} again unto Esther{H635} on the second{H8145} day{H3117} at the banquet{H4960} of wine{H3196}, What is thy petition{H7596}, queen{H4436} Esther{H635}? and it shall be granted{H5414}{(H8735)} thee: and what is thy request{H1246}? and it shall be performed{H6213}{(H8735)}, even to the half{H2677} of the kingdom{H4438}."
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther{H635} the queen{H4436} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, If I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in thy sight{H5869}, O king{H4428}, and if it please{H2895}{(H8804)} the king{H4428}, let my life{H5315} be given{H5414}{(H8735)} me at my petition{H7596}, and my people{H5971} at my request{H1246}:"
Esther,7,4,"For we are sold{H4376}{(H8738)}, I and my people{H5971}, to be destroyed{H8045}{(H8687)}, to be slain{H2026}{(H8800)}, and to perish{H6}{(H8763)}. But if{H432} we had been sold{H4376}{(H8738)} for bondmen{H5650} and bondwomen{H8198}, I had held my tongue{H2790}{(H8689)}, although the enemy{H6862} could not countervail{H7737}{(H8802)} the king's{H4428} damage{H5143}."
Esther,7,5,"Then the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} answered{H559}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume{H4390}{(H8804)} in his heart{H3820} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} so?"
Esther,7,6,"And Esther{H635} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The adversary{H376}{H6862} and enemy{H341}{(H8802)} is this wicked{H7451} Haman{H2001}. Then Haman{H2001} was afraid{H1204}{(H8738)} before{H6440} the king{H4428} and the queen{H4436}."
Esther,7,7,And the king{H4428} arising{H6965}{(H8804)} from the banquet{H4960} of wine{H3196} in his wrath{H2534} went into the palace{H1055} garden{H1594}: and Haman{H2001} stood up{H5975}{(H8804)} to make request{H1245}{(H8763)} for his life{H5315} to Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}; for he saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that there was evil{H7451} determined{H3615}{(H8804)} against him by the king{H4428}.
Esther,7,8,"Then the king{H4428} returned{H7725}{(H8804)} out of the palace{H1055} garden{H1594} into the place{H1004} of the banquet{H4960} of wine{H3196}; and Haman{H2001} was fallen{H5307}{(H8802)} upon the bed{H4296} whereon Esther{H635} was. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, Will he force{H3533}{(H8800)} the queen{H4436} also before me in the house{H1004}? As the word{H1697} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the king's{H4428} mouth{H6310}, they covered{H2645}{(H8804)} Haman's{H2001} face{H6440}."
Esther,7,9,"And Harbonah{H2726}, one{H259} of the chamberlains{H5631}, said{H559}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, Behold also, the gallows{H6086} fifty{H2572} cubits{H520} high{H1364}, which Haman{H2001} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} for Mordecai{H4782}, who had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} good{H2896} for the king{H4428}, standeth{H5975}{(H8802)} in the house{H1004} of Haman{H2001}. Then the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hang{H8518}{(H8798)} him thereon."
Esther,7,10,So they hanged{H8518}{(H8799)} Haman{H2001} on the gallows{H6086} that he had prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} for Mordecai{H4782}. Then was the king's{H4428} wrath{H2534} pacified{H7918}{(H8804)}.
Esther,8,1,On that day{H3117} did the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} give{H5414}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of Haman{H2001} the Jews{H3064}' enemy{H6887}{(H8802)} unto Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}. And Mordecai{H4782} came{H935}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}; for Esther{H635} had told{H5046}{(H8689)} what he was unto her.
Esther,8,2,"And the king{H4428} took off{H5493}{(H8686)} his ring{H2885}, which he had taken{H5674}{(H8689)} from Haman{H2001}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it unto Mordecai{H4782}. And Esther{H635} set{H7760}{(H8799)} Mordecai{H4782} over the house{H1004} of Haman{H2001}."
Esther,8,3,"And Esther{H635} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} yet again{H3254}{(H8686)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, and fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} at{H6440} his feet{H7272}, and besought{H2603}{(H8691)} him with tears{H1058}{(H8799)} to put away{H5674}{(H8687)} the mischief{H7451} of Haman{H2001} the Agagite{H91}, and his device{H4284} that he had devised{H2803}{(H8804)} against the Jews{H3064}."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king{H4428} held out{H3447}{(H8686)} the golden{H2091} sceptre{H8275} toward Esther{H635}. So Esther{H635} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428},"
Esther,8,5,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, If it please{H2896} the king{H4428}, and if I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} favour{H2580} in his sight{H6440}, and the thing{H1697} seem right{H3787}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, and I be pleasing{H2896} in his eyes{H5869}, let it be written{H3789}{(H8735)} to reverse{H7725}{(H8687)} the letters{H5612} devised{H4284} by Haman{H2001} the son{H1121} of Hammedatha{H4099} the Agagite{H91}, which he wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} to destroy{H6}{(H8763)} the Jews{H3064} which are in all the king's{H4428} provinces{H4082}:"
Esther,8,6,For how{H349} can I endure{H3201}{(H8799)} to see{H7200}{(H8804)} the evil{H7451} that shall come{H4672}{(H8799)} unto my people{H5971}? or how{H349} can I endure{H3201}{(H8799)} to see{H7200}{(H8804)} the destruction{H13} of my kindred{H4138}?
Esther,8,7,"Then the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Esther{H635} the queen{H4436} and to Mordecai{H4782} the Jew{H3064}, Behold, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} Esther{H635} the house{H1004} of Haman{H2001}, and him they have hanged{H8518}{(H8804)} upon the gallows{H6086}, because he laid{H7971}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} upon the Jews{H3064}."
Esther,8,8,"Write{H3789}{(H8798)} ye also for the Jews{H3064}, as it liketh{H2896} you{H5869}, in the king's{H4428} name{H8034}, and seal{H2856}{(H8798)} it with the king's{H4428} ring{H2885}: for the writing{H3791} which is written{H3789}{(H8737)} in the king's{H4428} name{H8034}, and sealed{H2856}{(H8737)} with the king's{H4428} ring{H2885}, may no man reverse{H7725}{(H8687)}."
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king's{H4428} scribes{H5608}{(H8802)} called{H7121}{(H8735)} at that time{H6256} in the third{H7992} month{H2320}, that is, the month{H2320} Sivan{H5510}, on the three{H7969} and twentieth{H6242} day thereof; and it was written{H3789}{(H8735)} according to all that Mordecai{H4782} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} unto the Jews{H3064}, and to the lieutenants{H323}, and the deputies{H6346} and rulers{H8269} of the provinces{H4082} which are from India{H1912} unto Ethiopia{H3568}, an hundred{H3967} twenty{H6242} and seven{H7651} provinces{H4082}, unto every province{H4082} according to the writing{H3791} thereof, and unto every people{H5971} after their language{H3956}, and to the Jews{H3064} according to their writing{H3791}, and according to their language{H3956}."
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} in the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}' name{H8034}, and sealed{H2856}{(H8799)} it with the king's{H4428} ring{H2885}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} letters{H5612} by{H3027} posts{H7323}{(H8801)} on horseback{H5483}, and riders{H7392}{(H8802)} on mules{H7409}, camels{H327}, and young{H1121} dromedaries{H7424}:"
Esther,8,11,"Wherein the king{H4428} granted{H5414}{(H8804)} the Jews{H3064} which were in every city{H5892} to gather themselves together{H6950}{(H8736)}, and to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} for their life{H5315}, to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)}, to slay{H2026}{(H8800)}, and to cause to perish{H6}{(H8763)}, all the power{H2428} of the people{H5971} and province{H4082} that would assault{H6696}{(H8802)} them, both little ones{H2945} and women{H802}, and to take the spoil{H7998} of them for a prey{H962}{(H8800)},"
Esther,8,12,"Upon one{H259} day{H3117} in all the provinces{H4082} of king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, namely, upon the thirteenth{H7969}{H6240} day of the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} month{H2320}, which is the month{H2320} Adar{H143}."
Esther,8,13,"The copy{H6572} of the writing{H3791} for a commandment{H1881} to be given{H5414}{(H8736)} in every province{H4082} was published{H1540}{(H8803)} unto all people{H5971}, and that the Jews{H3064} should be ready{H6264}{(H8675)}{H6259} against that day{H3117} to avenge{H5358}{(H8736)} themselves on their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
Esther,8,14,"So the posts{H7323}{(H8801)} that rode{H7392}{(H8802)} upon mules{H7409} and camels{H327} went out{H3318}{(H8804)}, being hastened{H926}{(H8794)} and pressed on{H1765}{(H8803)} by the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697}. And the decree{H1881} was given{H5414}{(H8738)} at Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002}."
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai{H4782} went out{H3318}{(H8804)} from the presence{H6440} of the king{H4428} in royal{H4438} apparel{H3830} of blue{H8504} and white{H2353}, and with a great{H1419} crown{H5850} of gold{H2091}, and with a garment{H8509} of fine linen{H948} and purple{H713}: and the city{H5892} of Shushan{H7800} rejoiced{H6670}{(H8804)} and was glad{H8056}."
Esther,8,16,"The Jews{H3064} had light{H219}, and gladness{H8057}, and joy{H8342}, and honour{H3366}."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province{H4082}, and in every city{H5892}, whithersoever{H4725} the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697} and his decree{H1881} came{H5060}{(H8688)}, the Jews{H3064} had joy{H8057} and gladness{H8342}, a feast{H4960} and a good{H2896} day{H3117}. And many{H7227} of the people{H5971} of the land{H776} became Jews{H3054}{(H8693)}; for the fear{H6343} of the Jews{H3064} fell{H5307}{(H8804)} upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} month{H2320}, that is, the month{H2320} Adar{H143}, on the thirteenth{H7969}{H6240} day{H3117} of the same, when the king's{H4428} commandment{H1697} and his decree{H1881} drew near{H5060}{(H8689)} to be put in execution{H6213}{(H8736)}, in the day{H3117} that the enemies{H341}{(H8802)} of the Jews{H3064} hoped{H7663}{(H8765)} to have power{H7980}{(H8800)} over them,(though it was turned{H2015}{(H8736)} to the contrary, that the Jews{H3064} had rule{H7980}{(H8799)} over them that hated{H8130}{(H8802)} them;)"
Esther,9,2,"The Jews{H3064} gathered themselves together{H6950}{(H8738)} in their cities{H5892} throughout all the provinces{H4082} of the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, to lay{H7971}{(H8800)} hand{H3027} on such as sought{H1245}{(H8764)} their hurt{H7451}: and no man{H376} could withstand{H5975}{(H8804)} them{H6440}; for the fear{H6343} of them fell{H5307}{(H8804)} upon all people{H5971}."
Esther,9,3,"And all the rulers{H8269} of the provinces{H4082}, and the lieutenants{H323}, and the deputies{H6346}, and officers{H6213}{(H8802)}{H4399} of the king{H4428}, helped{H5375}{(H8764)} the Jews{H3064}; because the fear{H6343} of Mordecai{H4782} fell{H5307}{(H8804)} upon them."
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai{H4782} was great{H1419} in the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and his fame{H8089} went out{H1980}{(H8802)} throughout all the provinces{H4082}: for this man{H376} Mordecai{H4782} waxed{H1980}{(H8802)} greater and greater{H1419}."
Esther,9,5,"Thus the Jews{H3064} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} all their enemies{H341}{(H8802)} with the stroke{H4347} of the sword{H2719}, and slaughter{H2027}, and destruction{H12}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} what they would{H7522} unto those that hated{H8130}{(H8802)} them."
Esther,9,6,And in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002} the Jews{H3064} slew{H2026}{(H8804)} and destroyed{H6}{(H8763)} five{H2568} hundred{H3967} men{H376}.
Esther,9,7,"And Parshandatha{H6577}, and Dalphon{H1813}, and Aspatha{H630},"
Esther,9,8,"And Poratha{H6334}, and Adalia{H118}, and Aridatha{H743},"

Esther,9,10,"The ten{H6235} sons{H1121} of Haman{H2001} the son{H1121} of Hammedatha{H4099}, the enemy{H6887}{(H8802)} of the Jews{H3064}, slew{H2026}{(H8804)} they; but on the spoil{H961} laid{H7971}{(H8804)} they not their hand{H3027}."
Esther,9,11,On that day{H3117} the number{H4557} of those that were slain{H2026}{(H8803)} in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002} was brought{H935}{(H8804)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}.
Esther,9,12,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}, The Jews{H3064} have slain{H2026}{(H8804)} and destroyed{H6}{(H8763)} five{H2568} hundred{H3967} men{H376} in Shushan{H7800} the palace{H1002}, and the ten{H6235} sons{H1121} of Haman{H2001}; what have they done{H6213}{(H8804)} in the rest{H7605} of the king's{H4428} provinces{H4082}? now what is thy petition{H7596}? and it shall be granted{H5414}{(H8735)} thee: or what is thy request{H1246} further{H5750}? and it shall be done{H6213}{(H8735)}."
Esther,9,13,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Esther{H635}, If it please{H2896} the king{H4428}, let it be granted{H5414}{(H8735)} to the Jews{H3064} which are in Shushan{H7800} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} to morrow{H4279} also according unto this day's{H3117} decree{H1881}, and let Haman's{H2001} ten{H6235} sons{H1121} be hanged{H8518}{(H8799)} upon the gallows{H6086}."
Esther,9,14,And the king{H4428} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} it so to be done{H6213}{(H8736)}: and the decree{H1881} was given{H5414}{(H8735)} at Shushan{H7800}; and they hanged{H8518}{(H8804)} Haman's{H2001} ten{H6235} sons{H1121}.
Esther,9,15,"For the Jews{H3064} that were in Shushan{H7800} gathered themselves together{H6950}{(H8735)} on the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} day{H3117} also of the month{H2320} Adar{H143}, and slew{H2026}{(H8799)} three{H7969} hundred{H3967} men{H376} at Shushan{H7800}; but on the prey{H961} they laid{H7971}{(H8804)} not their hand{H3027}."
Esther,9,16,"But the other{H7605} Jews{H3064} that were in the king's{H4428} provinces{H4082} gathered themselves together{H6950}{(H8738)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8800)} for their lives{H5315}, and had rest{H5118} from their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and slew{H2026}{(H8800)} of their foes{H8130}{(H8802)} seventy{H7657} and five{H2568} thousand{H505}, but they laid{H7971}{(H8804)} not their hands{H3027} on the prey{H961},"
Esther,9,17,"On the thirteenth{H7969}{H6240} day{H3117} of the month{H2320} Adar{H143}; and on the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} day of the same rested{H5118} they, and made{H6213}{(H8800)} it a day{H3117} of feasting{H4960} and gladness{H8057}."
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews{H3064} that were at Shushan{H7800} assembled together{H6950}{(H8738)} on the thirteenth{H7969}{H6240} day thereof, and on the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} thereof; and on the fifteenth{H2568}{H6240} day of the same they rested{H5118}, and made{H6213}{(H8800)} it a day{H3117} of feasting{H4960} and gladness{H8057}."
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews{H3064} of the villages{H6521}, that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in the unwalled{H6519} towns{H5892}, made{H6213}{(H8802)} the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} day{H3117} of the month{H2320} Adar{H143} a day of gladness{H8057} and feasting{H4960}, and a good{H2896} day{H3117}, and of sending{H4916} portions{H4490} one{H376} to another{H7453}."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai{H4782} wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} these things{H1697}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} letters{H5612} unto all the Jews{H3064} that were in all the provinces{H4082} of the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, both nigh{H7138} and far{H7350},"
Esther,9,21,"To stablish{H6965}{(H8763)} this among them, that they should keep{H6213}{(H8802)} the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} day{H3117} of the month{H2320} Adar{H143}, and the fifteenth{H2568}{H6240} day{H3117} of the same, yearly{H8141}{H8141},"
Esther,9,22,"As the days{H3117} wherein the Jews{H3064} rested{H5117}{(H8804)} from their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and the month{H2320} which was turned{H2015}{(H8738)} unto them from sorrow{H3015} to joy{H8057}, and from mourning{H60} into a good{H2896} day{H3117}: that they should make{H6213}{(H8800)} them days{H3117} of feasting{H4960} and joy{H8057}, and of sending{H4916} portions{H4490} one{H376} to another{H7453}, and gifts{H4979} to the poor{H34}."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews{H3064} undertook{H6901}{(H8765)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} as they had begun{H2490}{(H8689)}, and as Mordecai{H4782} had written{H3789}{(H8804)} unto them;"
Esther,9,24,"Because Haman{H2001} the son{H1121} of Hammedatha{H4099}, the Agagite{H91}, the enemy{H6887}{(H8802)} of all the Jews{H3064}, had devised{H2803}{(H8804)} against the Jews{H3064} to destroy{H6}{(H8763)} them, and had cast{H5307}{(H8689)} Pur{H6332}, that is, the lot{H1486}, to consume{H2000}{(H8800)} them, and to destroy{H6}{(H8763)} them;"
Esther,9,25,"But when Esther came{H935}{(H8800)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, he commanded{H559}{(H8804)} by letters{H5612} that his wicked{H7451} device{H4284}, which he devised{H2803}{(H8804)} against the Jews{H3064}, should return{H7725}{(H8799)} upon his own head{H7218}, and that he and his sons{H1121} should be hanged{H8518}{(H8804)} on the gallows{H6086}."
Esther,9,26,"Wherefore they called{H7121}{(H8804)} these days{H3117} Purim{H6332} after the name{H8034} of Pur{H6332}. Therefore for all the words{H1697} of this letter{H107}, and of that which they had seen{H7200}{(H8804)} concerning this matter{H3602}, and which had come{H5060}{(H8689)} unto them,"
Esther,9,27,"The Jews{H3064} ordained{H6965}{(H8765)}, and took{H6901}{(H8765)} upon them, and upon their seed{H2233}, and upon all such as joined{H3867}{(H8737)} themselves unto them, so as it should not fail{H5674}{(H8799)}, that they would keep{H6213}{(H8802)} these two{H8147} days{H3117} according to their writing{H3791}, and according to their appointed time{H2165} every year{H8141}{H8141};"
Esther,9,28,"And that these days{H3117} should be remembered{H2142}{(H8737)} and kept{H6213}{(H8737)} throughout{H1755} every generation{H1755}, every family{H4940}, every province{H4082}, and every city{H5892}; and that these days{H3117} of Purim{H6332} should not fail{H5674}{(H8799)} from among{H8432} the Jews{H3064}, nor the memorial{H2143} of them perish{H5486}{(H8799)} from their seed{H2233}."
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther{H635} the queen{H4436}, the daughter{H1323} of Abihail{H32}, and Mordecai{H4782} the Jew{H3064}, wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} with all authority{H8633}, to confirm{H6965}{(H8763)} this second{H8145} letter{H107} of Purim{H6332}."
Esther,9,30,"And he sent{H7971}{(H8799)} the letters{H5612} unto all the Jews{H3064}, to the hundred{H3967} twenty{H6242} and seven{H7651} provinces{H4082} of the kingdom{H4438} of Ahasuerus{H325}, with words{H1697} of peace{H7965} and truth{H571},"
Esther,9,31,"To confirm{H6965}{(H8763)} these days{H3117} of Purim{H6332} in their times{H2165} appointed, according as Mordecai{H4782} the Jew{H3064} and Esther{H635} the queen{H4436} had enjoined{H6965}{(H8765)} them, and as they had decreed{H6965}{(H8765)} for themselves{H5315} and for their seed{H2233}, the matters{H1697} of the fastings{H6685} and their cry{H2201}."
Esther,9,32,And the decree{H3982} of Esther{H635} confirmed{H6965}{(H8765)} these matters{H1697} of Purim{H6332}; and it was written{H3789}{(H8737)} in the book{H5612}.
Esther,10,1,"And the king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325} laid{H7760}{(H8799)} a tribute{H4522} upon the land{H776}, and upon the isles{H339} of the sea{H3220}."
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts{H4639} of his power{H8633} and of his might{H1369}, and the declaration{H6575} of the greatness{H1420} of Mordecai{H4782}, whereunto the king{H4428} advanced{H1431}{(H8765)} him, are they not written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612} of the chronicles{H1697}{H3117} of the kings{H4428} of Media{H4074} and Persia{H6539}?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai{H4782} the Jew{H3064} was next{H4932} unto king{H4428} Ahasuerus{H325}, and great{H1419} among the Jews{H3064}, and accepted{H7521}{(H8803)} of the multitude{H7230} of his brethren{H251}, seeking{H1875}{(H8802)} the wealth{H2896} of his people{H5971}, and speaking{H1696}{(H8802)} peace{H7965} to all his seed{H2233}."
Job,1,1,"There was a man{H376} in the land{H776} of Uz{H5780}, whose name{H8034} was Job{H347}; and that man{H376} was perfect{H8535} and upright{H3477}, and one that feared{H3373} God{H430}, and eschewed{H5493}{(H8802)} evil{H7451}."
Job,1,2,And there were born{H3205}{(H8735)} unto him seven{H7651} sons{H1121} and three{H7969} daughters{H1323}.
Job,1,3,"His substance{H4735} also was seven{H7651} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}, and three{H7969} thousand{H505} camels{H1581}, and five{H2568} hundred{H3967} yoke{H6776} of oxen{H1241}, and five{H2568} hundred{H3967} she asses{H860}, and a very{H3966} great{H7227} household{H5657}; so that this man{H376} was the greatest{H1419} of all the men{H1121} of the east{H6924}."
Job,1,4,"And his sons{H1121} went{H1980}{(H8804)} and feasted{H4960}{H6213}{(H8804)} in their houses{H1004}, every one{H376} his day{H3117}; and sent{H7971}{(H8804)} and called{H7121}{(H8804)} for their three{H7969} sisters{H269} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} and to drink{H8354}{(H8800)} with them."
Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days{H3117} of their feasting{H4960} were gone about{H5362}{(H8689)}, that Job{H347} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} and sanctified{H6942}{(H8762)} them, and rose up early{H7925}{(H8689)} in the morning{H1242}, and offered{H5927}{(H8689)} burnt offerings{H5930} according to the number{H4557} of them all: for Job{H347} said{H559}{(H8804)}, It may be{H194} that my sons{H1121} have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, and cursed{H1288}{(H8765)} God{H430} in their hearts{H3824}. Thus did{H6213}{(H8799)} Job{H347} continually{H3117}."
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day{H3117} when the sons{H1121} of God{H430} came{H935}{(H8799)} to present{H3320}{(H8692)} themselves before the LORD{H3068}, and Satan{H7854} came{H935}{(H8799)} also among{H8432} them."
Job,1,7,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, Whence{H370} comest{H935}{(H8799)} thou? Then Satan{H7854} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, From going to and fro{H7751}{(H8800)} in the earth{H776}, and from walking up and down{H1980}{(H8692)} in it."
Job,1,8,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, Hast thou considered{H7760}{(H8804)}{H3820} my servant{H5650} Job{H347}, that there is none like him in the earth{H776}, a perfect{H8535} and an upright{H3477} man{H376}, one that feareth{H3373} God{H430}, and escheweth{H5493}{(H8802)} evil{H7451}?"
Job,1,9,"Then Satan{H7854} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Doth Job{H347} fear{H3372}{(H8804)} God{H430} for nought{H2600}?"
Job,1,10,"Hast not thou made an hedge{H7753}{(H8804)} about him, and about{H1157} his house{H1004}, and about all that he hath on every side{H5439}? thou hast blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} the work{H4639} of his hands{H3027}, and his substance{H4735} is increased{H6555}{(H8804)} in the land{H776}."
Job,1,11,"But{H199} put forth{H7971}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3027} now, and touch{H5060}{(H8798)} all that he hath, and he will curse{H1288}{(H8762)}{H3808} thee to thy face{H6440}."
Job,1,12,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power{H3027}; only upon himself put not forth{H7971}{(H8799)} thine hand{H3027}. So Satan{H7854} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} from the presence{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}."
Job,1,13,And there was a day{H3117} when his sons{H1121} and his daughters{H1323} were eating{H398}{(H8802)} and drinking{H8354}{(H8802)} wine{H3196} in their eldest{H1060} brother's{H251} house{H1004}:
Job,1,14,"And there came{H935}{(H8804)} a messenger{H4397} unto Job{H347}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, The oxen{H1241} were plowing{H2790}{(H8802)}, and the asses{H860} feeding{H7462}{(H8802)} beside{H3027} them:"
Job,1,15,"And the Sabeans{H7614} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon them, and took them away{H3947}{(H8799)}; yea, they have slain{H5221}{(H8689)} the servants{H5288} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}; and I only am escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} alone to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} thee."
Job,1,16,"While he was yet speaking{H1696}{(H8764)}, there came{H935}{(H8802)} also another, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, The fire{H784} of God{H430} is fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} from heaven{H8064}, and hath burned up{H1197}{(H8799)} the sheep{H6629}, and the servants{H5288}, and consumed{H398}{(H8799)} them; and I only am escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} alone to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} thee."
Job,1,17,"While he was yet speaking{H1696}{(H8764)}, there came{H935}{(H8802)} also another, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, The Chaldeans{H3778} made out{H7760}{(H8804)} three{H7969} bands{H7218}, and fell{H6584}{(H8799)} upon the camels{H1581}, and have carried them away{H3947}{(H8799)}, yea, and slain{H5221}{(H8689)} the servants{H5288} with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}; and I only am escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} alone to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} thee."
Job,1,18,"While he was yet speaking{H1696}{(H8764)}, there came{H935}{(H8802)} also another, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Thy sons{H1121} and thy daughters{H1323} were eating{H398}{(H8802)} and drinking{H8354}{(H8802)} wine{H3196} in their eldest{H1060} brother's{H251} house{H1004}:"
Job,1,19,"And, behold, there came{H935}{(H8804)} a great{H1419} wind{H7307} from{H5676} the wilderness{H4057}, and smote{H5060}{(H8799)} the four{H702} corners{H6438} of the house{H1004}, and it fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the young men{H5288}, and they are dead{H4191}{(H8799)}; and I only am escaped{H4422}{(H8735)} alone to tell{H5046}{(H8687)} thee."
Job,1,20,"Then Job{H347} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and rent{H7167}{(H8799)} his mantle{H4598}, and shaved{H1494}{(H8799)} his head{H7218}, and fell down{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the ground{H776}, and worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)},"
Job,1,21,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, Naked{H6174} came I out{H3318}{(H8804)} of my mother's{H517} womb{H990}, and naked{H6174} shall I return{H7725}{(H8799)} thither: the LORD{H3068} gave{H5414}{(H8804)}, and the LORD{H3068} hath taken away{H3947}{(H8804)}; blessed{H1288}{(H8794)} be the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}."
Job,1,22,"In all this Job{H347} sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} not, nor charged{H5414}{(H8804)} God{H430} foolishly{H8604}."
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day{H3117} when the sons{H1121} of God{H430} came{H935}{(H8799)} to present{H3320}{(H8692)} themselves before the LORD{H3068}, and Satan{H7854} came{H935}{(H8799)} also among{H8432} them to present{H3320}{(H8692)} himself before the LORD{H3068}."
Job,2,2,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, From whence{H335} comest{H935}{(H8799)} thou?

Job,2,3,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, Hast thou{H7760}{(H8804)} considered{H3820} my servant{H5650} Job{H347}, that there is none like him in the earth{H776}, a perfect{H8535} and an upright{H3477} man{H376}, one that feareth{H3373} God{H430}, and escheweth{H5493}{(H8802)} evil{H7451}? and still he holdeth fast{H2388}{(H8688)} his integrity{H8538}, although thou movedst{H5496}{(H8686)} me against him, to destroy{H1104}{(H8763)} him without cause{H2600}."
Job,2,4,"And Satan{H7854} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Skin{H5785} for skin{H5785}, yea, all that a man{H376} hath will he give{H5414}{(H8799)} for his life{H5315}."
Job,2,5,"But{H199} put forth{H7971}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3027} now, and touch{H5060}{(H8798)} his bone{H6106} and his flesh{H1320}, and he will curse{H1288}{(H8762)} thee to thy face{H6440}."
Job,2,6,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, Behold, he is in thine hand{H3027}; but save{H8104}{(H8798)} his life{H5315}."
Job,2,7,"So went{H3318} Satan{H7854} forth{H3318}{(H8799)} from the presence{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Job{H347} with sore{H7451} boils{H7822} from the sole{H3709} of his foot{H7272} unto his crown{H6936}."
Job,2,8,And he took{H3947}{(H8799)} him a potsherd{H2789} to scrape{H1623}{(H8692)} himself withal; and he sat down{H3427}{(H8802)} among{H8432} the ashes{H665}.
Job,2,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} his wife{H802} unto him, Dost thou still retain{H2388}{(H8688)} thine integrity{H8538}? curse{H1288}{(H8761)} God{H430}, and die{H4191}{(H8798)}."
Job,2,10,"But he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Thou speakest{H1696}{(H8762)} as one{H259} of the foolish women{H5036} speaketh{H1696}{(H8763)}. What{H1571}? shall we receive{H6901}{(H8762)} good{H2896} at the hand of God{H430}, and shall we not receive{H6901}{(H8762)} evil{H7451}? In all this did not Job{H347} sin{H2398}{(H8804)} with his lips{H8193}."
Job,2,11,"Now when Job's{H347} three{H7969} friends{H7453} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of all this evil{H7451} that was come{H935}{(H8802)} upon him, they came{H935}{(H8799)} every one{H376} from his own place{H4725}; Eliphaz{H464} the Temanite{H8489}, and Bildad{H1085} the Shuhite{H7747}, and Zophar{H6691} the Naamathite{H5284}: for they had made an appointment{H3259}{(H8735)} together{H3162} to come{H935}{(H8800)} to mourn{H5110}{(H8800)} with him and to comfort{H5162}{(H8763)} him."
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their eyes{H5869} afar off{H7350}, and knew{H5234}{(H8689)} him not, they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963}, and wept{H1058}{(H8799)}; and they rent{H7167}{(H8799)} every one{H376} his mantle{H4598}, and sprinkled{H2236}{(H8799)} dust{H6083} upon their heads{H7218} toward heaven{H8064}."
Job,2,13,"So they sat down{H3427}{(H8799)} with him upon the ground{H776} seven{H7651} days{H3117} and seven{H7651} nights{H3915}, and none spake{H1696}{(H8802)} a word{H1697} unto him: for they saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that his grief{H3511} was very{H3966} great{H1431}{(H8804)}."
Job,3,1,"After{H310} this opened{H6605}{(H8804)} Job{H347} his mouth{H6310}, and cursed{H7043}{(H8762)} his day{H3117}."
Job,3,2,"And Job{H347} spake{H6030}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,3,3,"Let the day{H3117} perish{H6}{(H8799)} wherein I was born{H3205}{(H8735)}, and the night{H3915} in which it was said{H559}{(H8804)}, There is a man child{H1397} conceived{H2029}{(H8795)}."
Job,3,4,"Let that day{H3117} be darkness{H2822}; let not God{H433} regard{H1875}{(H8799)} it from above{H4605}, neither let the light{H5105} shine{H3313}{(H8686)} upon it."
Job,3,5,Let darkness{H2822} and the shadow of death{H6757} stain{H1350}{(H8799)} it; let a cloud{H6053} dwell{H7931}{(H8799)} upon it; let the blackness{H3650} of the day{H3117} terrify{H1204}{(H8762)} it.
Job,3,6,"As for that night{H3915}, let darkness{H652} seize{H3947}{(H8799)} upon it; let it not be joined{H2302}{(H8799)} unto the days{H3117} of the year{H8141}, let it not come{H935}{(H8799)} into the number{H4557} of the months{H3391}."
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night{H3915} be solitary{H1565}, let no joyful voice{H7445} come{H935}{(H8799)} therein."
Job,3,8,"Let them curse{H5344}{(H8799)} it that curse{H779}{(H8802)} the day{H3117}, who are ready{H6264} to raise up{H5782}{(H8788)} their mourning{H3882}."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars{H3556} of the twilight{H5399} thereof be dark{H2821}{(H8799)}; let it look{H6960}{(H8762)} for light{H216}, but have none; neither let it see{H7200}{(H8799)} the dawning{H6079} of the day{H7837}:"
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up{H5462}{(H8804)} the doors{H1817} of my mother's womb{H990}, nor hid{H5641}{(H8686)} sorrow{H5999} from mine eyes{H5869}."
Job,3,11,Why died{H4191}{(H8799)} I not from the womb{H7358}? why did I not give up the ghost{H1478}{(H8799)} when I came out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the belly{H990}?
Job,3,12,Why did the knees{H1290} prevent{H6923}{(H8765)} me? or why the breasts{H7699} that I should suck{H3243}{(H8799)}?
Job,3,13,"For now should I have lain still{H7901}{(H8804)} and been quiet{H8252}{(H8799)}, I should have slept{H3462}{(H8804)}: then had I been at rest{H5117}{(H8799)},"
Job,3,14,"With kings{H4428} and counsellors{H3289}{(H8802)} of the earth{H776}, which built{H1129}{(H8802)} desolate places{H2723} for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes{H8269} that had gold{H2091}, who filled{H4390}{(H8764)} their houses{H1004} with silver{H3701}:"
Job,3,16,Or as an hidden{H2934}{(H8803)} untimely birth{H5309} I had not been; as infants{H5768} which never saw{H7200}{(H8804)} light{H216}.
Job,3,17,There the wicked{H7563} cease{H2308}{(H8804)} from troubling{H7267}; and there the weary{H3019}{H3581} be at rest{H5117}{(H8799)}.
Job,3,18,There the prisoners{H615} rest{H7599}{(H8768)} together{H3162}; they hear{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the oppressor{H5065}{(H8802)}.
Job,3,19,The small{H6996} and great{H1419} are there; and the servant{H5650} is free{H2670} from his master{H113}.
Job,3,20,"Wherefore is light{H216} given{H5414}{(H8799)} to him that is in misery{H6001}, and life{H2416} unto the bitter{H4751} in soul{H5315};"
Job,3,21,"Which long{H2442}{(H8764)} for death{H4194}, but it cometh not; and dig{H2658}{(H8799)} for it more than for hid treasures{H4301};"
Job,3,22,"Which rejoice{H8056} exceedingly{H1524}, and are glad{H7797}{(H8799)}, when they can find{H4672}{(H8799)} the grave{H6913}?"
Job,3,23,"Why is light given to a man{H1397} whose way{H1870} is hid{H5641}{(H8738)}, and whom God{H433} hath hedged in{H5526}{(H8686)}?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing{H585} cometh{H935}{(H8799)} before{H6440} I eat{H3899}, and my roarings{H7581} are poured out{H5413}{(H8799)} like the waters{H4325}."
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I greatly{H6343} feared{H6342}{(H8804)} is come{H857}{(H8799)} upon me, and that which I was afraid{H3025}{(H8804)} of is come{H935}{(H8799)} unto me."
Job,3,26,"I was not in safety{H7951}{(H8804)}, neither had I rest{H8252}{(H8804)}, neither was I quiet{H5117}{(H8804)}; yet trouble{H7267} came{H935}{(H8799)}."
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz{H464} the Temanite{H8489} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,4,2,"If we assay{H5254}{(H8765)} to commune{H1697} with thee, wilt thou be grieved{H3811}{(H8799)}? but who can{H3201}{(H8799)} withhold{H6113}{(H8800)} himself from speaking{H4405}?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed{H3256}{(H8765)} many{H7227}, and thou hast strengthened{H2388}{(H8762)} the weak{H7504} hands{H3027}."
Job,4,4,"Thy words{H4405} have upholden{H6965}{(H8686)} him that was falling{H3782}{(H8802)}, and thou hast strengthened{H553}{(H8762)} the feeble{H3766}{(H8802)} knees{H1290}."
Job,4,5,"But now it is come{H935}{(H8799)} upon thee, and thou faintest{H3811}{(H8799)}; it toucheth{H5060}{(H8799)} thee, and thou art troubled{H926}{(H8735)}."
Job,4,6,"Is not this thy fear{H3374}, thy confidence{H3690}, thy hope{H8615}, and the uprightness{H8537} of thy ways{H1870}?"
Job,4,7,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, who ever perished{H6}{(H8804)}, being innocent{H5355}? or where{H375} were the righteous{H3477} cut off{H3582}{(H8738)}?"
Job,4,8,"Even as I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)}, they that plow{H2790}{(H8802)} iniquity{H205}, and sow{H2232}{(H8802)} wickedness{H5999}, reap{H7114}{(H8799)} the same."
Job,4,9,"By the blast{H5397} of God{H433} they perish{H6}{(H8799)}, and by the breath{H7307} of his nostrils{H639} are they consumed{H3615}{(H8799)}."
Job,4,10,"The roaring{H7581} of the lion{H738}, and the voice{H6963} of the fierce lion{H7826}, and the teeth{H8127} of the young lions{H3715}, are broken{H5421}{(H8738)}."
Job,4,11,"The old lion{H3918} perisheth{H6}{(H8802)} for lack{H1097} of prey{H2964}, and the stout lion's{H3833} whelps{H1121} are scattered abroad{H6504}{(H8691)}."
Job,4,12,"Now a thing{H1697} was secretly brought{H1589}{(H8792)} to me, and mine ear{H241} received{H3947}{(H8799)} a little{H8102} thereof."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts{H5587} from the visions{H2384} of the night{H3915}, when deep sleep{H8639} falleth{H5307}{(H8800)} on men{H582},"
Job,4,14,"Fear{H6343} came{H7122}{(H8804)} upon me, and trembling{H7461}, which made all{H7230} my bones{H6106} to shake{H6342}{(H8689)}."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit{H7307} passed{H2498}{(H8799)} before my face{H6440}; the hair{H8185} of my flesh{H1320} stood up{H5568}{(H8762)}:
Job,4,16,"It stood still{H5975}{(H8799)}, but I could not discern{H5234}{(H8686)} the form{H4758} thereof: an image{H8544} was before mine eyes{H5869}, there was silence{H1827}, and I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} a voice{H6963}, saying,"
Job,4,17,Shall mortal man{H582} be more just{H6663}{(H8799)} than God{H433}? shall a man{H1397} be more pure{H2891}{(H8799)} than his maker{H6213}{(H8802)}?
Job,4,18,"Behold, he put no trust{H539}{(H8686)} in his servants{H5650}; and his angels{H4397} he charged{H7760}{(H8799)} with folly{H8417}:"
Job,4,19,"How much less{H637} in them that dwell{H7931}{(H8802)} in houses{H1004} of clay{H2563}, whose foundation{H3247} is in the dust{H6083}, which are crushed{H1792}{(H8762)} before{H6440} the moth{H6211}?"
Job,4,20,They are destroyed{H3807}{(H8714)} from morning{H1242} to evening{H6153}: they perish{H6}{(H8799)} for ever{H5331} without any regarding{H7760}{(H8688)} it.
Job,4,21,"Doth not their excellency{H3499} which is in them go away{H5265}{(H8738)}? they die{H4191}{(H8799)}, even without wisdom{H2451}."
Job,5,1,"Call{H7121}{(H8798)} now, if there be{H3426} any that will answer{H6030}{(H8802)} thee; and to which of the saints{H6918} wilt thou turn{H6437}{(H8799)}?"
Job,5,2,"For wrath{H3708} killeth{H2026}{(H8799)} the foolish man{H191}, and envy{H7068} slayeth{H4191}{(H8686)} the silly one{H6601}{(H8802)}."
Job,5,3,I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the foolish{H191} taking root{H8327}{(H8688)}: but suddenly{H6597} I cursed{H5344}{(H8799)} his habitation{H5116}.
Job,5,4,"His children{H1121} are far{H7368}{(H8799)} from safety{H3468}, and they are crushed{H1792}{(H8691)} in the gate{H8179}, neither is there any to deliver{H5337}{(H8688)} them."
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest{H7105} the hungry{H7457} eateth up{H398}{(H8799)}, and taketh{H3947}{(H8799)} it even out{H413} of the thorns{H6791}, and the robber{H6782} swalloweth up{H7602}{(H8804)} their substance{H2428}."
Job,5,6,"Although affliction{H205} cometh not forth{H3318}{(H8799)} of the dust{H6083}, neither doth trouble{H5999} spring out{H6779}{(H8799)} of the ground{H127};"
Job,5,7,"Yet man{H120} is born{H3205}{(H8795)} unto trouble{H5999}, as the sparks{H1121}{H7565} fly{H5774}{(H8800)} upward{H1361}{(H8686)}."
Job,5,8,"I would seek{H199}{H1875}{(H8799)} unto God{H410}, and unto God{H430} would I commit{H7760}{(H8799)} my cause{H1700}:"
Job,5,9,Which doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} great things{H1419} and unsearchable{H369}{H2714}; marvellous things{H6381}{(H8737)} without number{H4557}:
Job,5,10,"Who giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} rain{H4306} upon{H6440} the earth{H776}, and sendeth{H7971}{(H8802)} waters{H4325} upon{H6440} the fields{H2351}:"
Job,5,11,To set up{H7760}{(H8800)} on high{H4791} those that be low{H8217}; that those which mourn{H6937}{(H8802)} may be exalted{H7682}{(H8804)} to safety{H3468}.
Job,5,12,"He disappointeth{H6565}{(H8688)} the devices{H4284} of the crafty{H6175}, so that their hands{H3027} cannot perform{H6213}{(H8799)} their enterprise{H8454}."
Job,5,13,He taketh{H3920}{(H8802)} the wise{H2450} in their own craftiness{H6193}: and the counsel{H6098} of the froward{H6617}{(H8737)} is carried headlong{H4116}{(H8737)}.
Job,5,14,"They meet{H6298}{(H8762)} with darkness{H2822} in the daytime{H3119}, and grope{H4959}{(H8762)} in the noonday{H6672} as in the night{H3915}."
Job,5,15,"But he saveth{H3467}{(H8686)} the poor{H34} from the sword{H2719}, from their mouth{H6310}, and from the hand{H3027} of the mighty{H2389}."
Job,5,16,"So the poor{H1800} hath hope{H8615}, and iniquity{H5766} stoppeth{H7092}{(H8804)} her mouth{H6310}."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy{H835} is the man{H582} whom God{H433} correcteth{H3198}{(H8686)}: therefore despise{H3988}{(H8799)} not thou the chastening{H4148} of the Almighty{H7706}:"
Job,5,18,"For he maketh sore{H3510}{(H8686)}, and bindeth up{H2280}{(H8799)}: he woundeth{H4272}{(H8799)}, and his hands{H3027} make whole{H7495}{(H8799)}."
Job,5,19,"He shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} thee in six{H8337} troubles{H6869}: yea, in seven{H7651} there shall no evil{H7451} touch{H5060}{(H8799)} thee."
Job,5,20,In famine{H7458} he shall redeem{H6299}{(H8804)} thee from death{H4194}: and in war{H4421} from the power{H3027} of the sword{H2719}.
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid{H2244}{(H8735)} from the scourge{H7752} of the tongue{H3956}: neither shalt thou be afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of destruction{H7701} when it cometh{H935}{(H8799)}.
Job,5,22,At destruction{H7701} and famine{H3720} thou shalt laugh{H7832}{(H8799)}: neither shalt thou be afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of the beasts{H2416} of the earth{H776}.
Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league{H1285} with the stones{H68} of the field{H7704}: and the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704} shall be at peace{H7999}{(H8717)} with thee.
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thy tabernacle{H168} shall be in peace{H7965}; and thou shalt visit{H6485}{(H8804)} thy habitation{H5116}, and shalt not sin{H2398}{(H8799)}."
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} also that thy seed{H2233} shall be great{H7227}, and thine offspring{H6631} as the grass{H6212} of the earth{H776}."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come{H935}{(H8799)} to thy grave{H6913} in a full age{H3624}, like as a shock of corn{H1430} cometh in{H5927}{(H8800)} in his season{H6256}."
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched{H2713}{(H8804)} it, so it is; hear{H8085}{(H8798)} it, and know{H3045}{(H8798)} thou it for thy good."
Job,6,1,"But Job{H347} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,6,2,"Oh that{H3863} my grief{H3708} were throughly{H8254}{(H8800)} weighed{H8254}{(H8735)}, and my calamity{H1942}{(H8675)}{H1962} laid{H5375}{(H8799)} in the balances{H3976} together{H3162}!"
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier{H3513}{(H8799)} than the sand{H2344} of the sea{H3220}: therefore my words{H1697} are swallowed up{H3886}{(H8804)}.
Job,6,4,"For the arrows{H2671} of the Almighty{H7706} are within{H5978} me, the poison{H2534} whereof drinketh up{H8354}{(H8802)} my spirit{H7307}: the terrors{H1161} of God{H433} do set themselves in array{H6186}{(H8799)} against me."
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass{H6501} bray{H5101}{(H8799)} when he hath grass{H1877}? or loweth{H1600}{(H8799)} the ox{H7794} over his fodder{H1098}?
Job,6,6,Can that which is unsavoury{H8602} be eaten{H398}{(H8735)} without salt{H4417}? or is there{H3426} any taste{H2940} in the white{H7388} of an egg{H2495}?
Job,6,7,The things that my soul{H5315} refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to touch{H5060}{(H8800)} are as my sorrowful{H1741} meat{H3899}.
Job,6,8,Oh that I might have{H935}{(H8799)} my request{H7596}; and that God{H433} would grant{H5414}{(H8799)} me the thing that I long for{H8615}!
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please{H2974}{(H8686)} God{H433} to destroy{H1792}{(H8762)} me; that he would let loose{H5425}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027}, and cut me off{H1214}{(H8762)}!"
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort{H5165}; yea, I would harden{H5539}{(H8762)} myself in sorrow{H2427}: let him not spare{H2550}{(H8799)}; for I have not concealed{H3582}{(H8765)} the words{H561} of the Holy One{H6918}."
Job,6,11,"What is my strength{H3581}, that I should hope{H3176}{(H8762)}? and what is mine end{H7093}, that I should prolong{H748}{(H8686)} my life{H5315}?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength{H3581} the strength{H3581} of stones{H68}? or is my flesh{H1320} of brass{H5153}?
Job,6,13,Is not my help{H5833} in me? and is wisdom{H8454} driven quite{H5080}{(H8738)} from me?
Job,6,14,To him that is afflicted{H4523} pity{H2617} should be shewed from his friend{H7453}; but he forsaketh{H5800}{(H8799)} the fear{H3374} of the Almighty{H7706}.
Job,6,15,"My brethren{H251} have dealt deceitfully{H898}{(H8804)} as a brook{H5158}, and as the stream{H650} of brooks{H5158} they pass away{H5674}{(H8799)};"
Job,6,16,"Which are blackish{H6937}{(H8802)} by reason of the ice{H7140}, and wherein the snow{H7950} is hid{H5956}{(H8691)}:"
Job,6,17,"What time{H6256} they wax warm{H2215}{(H8792)}, they vanish{H6789}{(H8738)}: when it is hot{H2527}, they are consumed out{H1846}{(H8738)} of their place{H4725}."
Job,6,18,"The paths{H734} of their way{H1870} are turned aside{H3943}{(H8735)}; they go{H5927}{(H8799)} to nothing{H8414}, and perish{H6}{(H8799)}."
Job,6,19,"The troops{H734} of Tema{H8485} looked{H5027}{(H8689)}, the companies{H1979} of Sheba{H7614} waited{H6960}{(H8765)} for them."
Job,6,20,"They were confounded{H954}{(H8804)} because they had hoped{H982}{(H8804)}; they came{H935}{(H8804)} thither, and were ashamed{H2659}{(H8799)}."
Job,6,21,"For now ye are nothing; ye see{H7200}{(H8799)} my casting down{H2866}, and are afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}."
Job,6,22,"Did I say{H559}{(H8804)}, Bring{H3051}{(H8798)} unto me? or, Give a reward{H7809}{(H8798)} for me of your substance{H3581}?"
Job,6,23,"Or, Deliver{H4422}{(H8761)} me from the enemy's{H6862} hand{H3027}? or, Redeem{H6299}{(H8799)} me from the hand{H3027} of the mighty{H6184}?"
Job,6,24,"Teach{H3384}{(H8685)} me, and I will hold my tongue{H2790}{(H8686)}: and cause me to understand{H995}{(H8685)} wherein I have erred{H7686}{(H8804)}."
Job,6,25,How forcible{H4834}{(H8738)} are right{H3476} words{H561}! but what doth your arguing{H3198}{(H8687)} reprove{H3198}{(H8686)}?
Job,6,26,"Do ye imagine{H2803}{(H8799)} to reprove{H3198}{(H8687)} words{H4405}, and the speeches{H561} of one that is desperate{H2976}{(H8737)}, which are as wind{H7307}?"
Job,6,27,"Yea, ye overwhelm{H5307}{(H8686)} the fatherless{H3490}, and ye dig{H3738}{(H8799)} a pit for your friend{H7453}."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore be content{H2974}{(H8685)}, look{H6437}{(H8798)} upon me; for it is evident{H6440} unto you if I lie{H3576}{(H8762)}."
Job,6,29,"Return{H7725}{(H8798)}, I pray you, let it not be iniquity{H5766}; yea, return again{H7725}{(H8798)}, my righteousness{H6664} is in it."
Job,6,30,Is there{H3426} iniquity{H5766} in my tongue{H3956}? cannot my taste{H2441} discern{H995}{(H8799)} perverse things{H1942}?
Job,7,1,Is there not an appointed time{H6635} to man{H582} upon earth{H776}? are not his days{H3117} also like the days{H3117} of an hireling{H7916}?
Job,7,2,"As a servant{H5650} earnestly desireth{H7602}{(H8799)} the shadow{H6738}, and as an hireling{H7916} looketh{H6960}{(H8762)} for the reward of his work{H6467}:"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess{H5157}{(H8717)} months{H3391} of vanity{H7723}, and wearisome{H5999} nights{H3915} are appointed{H4487}{(H8765)} to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down{H7901}{(H8804)}, I say{H559}{(H8804)}, When shall I arise{H6965}{(H8799)}, and the night{H6153} be gone{H4059}? and I am full{H7646}{(H8804)} of tossings to and fro{H5076} unto the dawning of the day{H5399}."
Job,7,5,"My flesh{H1320} is clothed{H3847}{(H8804)} with worms{H7415} and clods{H1487} of dust{H6083}; my skin{H5785} is broken{H7280}{(H8804)}, and become loathsome{H3988}{(H8735)}."
Job,7,6,"My days{H3117} are swifter{H7043}{(H8804)} than a weaver's shuttle{H708}, and are spent{H3615}{(H8799)} without{H657} hope{H8615}."
Job,7,7,O remember{H2142}{(H8798)} that my life{H2416} is wind{H7307}: mine eye{H5869} shall no more{H7725}{(H8799)} see{H7200}{(H8800)} good{H2896}.
Job,7,8,"The eye{H5869} of him that hath seen{H7210} me shall see{H7789}{(H8799)} me no more: thine eyes{H5869} are upon me, and I am not."
Job,7,9,As the cloud{H6051} is consumed{H3615}{(H8804)} and vanisheth away{H3212}{(H8799)}: so he that goeth down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the grave{H7585} shall come up{H5927}{(H8799)} no more.
Job,7,10,"He shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} no more to his house{H1004}, neither shall his place{H4725} know{H5234}{(H8686)} him any more."
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not refrain{H2820}{(H8799)} my mouth{H6310}; I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} in the anguish{H6862} of my spirit{H7307}; I will complain{H7878}{(H8799)} in the bitterness{H4751} of my soul{H5315}.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea{H3220}, or a whale{H8577}, that thou settest{H7760}{(H8799)} a watch{H4929} over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say{H559}{(H8804)}, My bed{H6210} shall comfort{H5162}{(H8762)} me, my couch{H4904} shall ease{H5375}{(H8799)} my complaint{H7879};"
Job,7,14,"Then thou scarest{H2865}{(H8765)} me with dreams{H2472}, and terrifiest{H1204}{(H8762)} me through visions{H2384}:"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul{H5315} chooseth{H977}{(H8799)} strangling{H4267}, and death{H4194} rather than my life{H6106}."
Job,7,16,I loathe{H3988}{(H8804)} it; I would not live{H2421}{(H8799)} alway{H5769}: let me alone{H2308}{(H8798)}; for my days{H3117} are vanity{H1892}.
Job,7,17,"What is man{H582}, that thou shouldest magnify{H1431}{(H8762)} him? and that thou shouldest set{H7896}{(H8799)} thine heart{H3820} upon him?"
Job,7,18,"And that thou shouldest visit{H6485}{(H8799)} him every morning{H1242}, and try{H974}{(H8799)} him every moment{H7281}?"
Job,7,19,"How long{H4100} wilt thou not depart{H8159}{(H8799)} from me, nor let me alone{H7503}{(H8686)} till I swallow down{H1104}{(H8800)} my spittle{H7536}?"
Job,7,20,"I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}; what shall I do{H6466}{(H8799)} unto thee, O thou preserver{H5341}{(H8802)} of men{H120}? why hast thou set{H7760}{(H8804)} me as a mark{H4645} against thee, so that I am a burden{H4853} to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why dost thou not pardon{H5375}{(H8799)} my transgression{H6588}, and take away{H5674}{(H8686)} mine iniquity{H5771}? for now shall I sleep{H7901}{(H8799)} in the dust{H6083}; and thou shalt seek me in the morning{H7836}{(H8765)}, but I shall not be."
Job,8,1,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Bildad{H1085} the Shuhite{H7747}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,8,2,How{H575} long{H5704} wilt thou speak{H4448}{(H8762)} these things? and how long shall the words{H561} of thy mouth{H6310} be like a strong{H3524} wind{H7307}?
Job,8,3,Doth God{H410} pervert{H5791}{(H8762)} judgment{H4941}? or doth the Almighty{H7706} pervert{H5791}{(H8762)} justice{H6664}?
Job,8,4,"If thy children{H1121} have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against him, and he have cast them away{H7971}{(H8762)} for{H3027} their transgression{H6588};"
Job,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek{H7836} unto God{H410} betimes{H7836}{(H8762)}, and make thy supplication{H2603}{(H8691)} to the Almighty{H7706};"
Job,8,6,"If thou wert pure{H2134} and upright{H3477}; surely now he would awake{H5782}{(H8686)} for thee, and make the habitation{H5116} of thy righteousness{H6664} prosperous{H7999}{(H8765)}."
Job,8,7,"Though thy beginning{H7225} was small{H4705}, yet thy latter end{H319} should greatly{H3966} increase{H7685}{(H8799)}."
Job,8,8,"For enquire{H7592}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, of the former{H7223}{(H8675)}{H7223} age{H1755}, and prepare{H3559}{(H8786)} thyself to the search{H2714} of their fathers{H1}:"
Job,8,9,"(For we are but of yesterday{H8543}, and know{H3045}{(H8799)} nothing, because our days{H3117} upon earth{H776} are a shadow{H6738}:)"
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach{H3384}{(H8686)} thee, and tell{H559}{(H8799)} thee, and utter{H3318}{(H8686)} words{H4405} out of their heart{H3820}?"
Job,8,11,Can the rush{H1573} grow up{H1342}{(H8799)} without mire{H1207}? can{H7685} the flag{H260} grow{H7685}{(H8799)} without{H1097} water{H4325}?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in his greenness{H3}, and not cut down{H6998}{(H8735)}, it withereth{H3001}{(H8799)} before{H6440} any other herb{H2682}."
Job,8,13,So are the paths{H734} of all that forget{H7911}{(H8802)} God{H410}; and the hypocrite's{H2611} hope{H8615} shall perish{H6}{(H8799)}:
Job,8,14,"Whose hope{H3689} shall be cut off{H6990}{(H8799)}, and whose trust{H4009} shall be a spider's{H5908} web{H1004}."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean{H8172}{(H8735)} upon his house{H1004}, but it shall not stand{H5975}{(H8799)}: he shall hold{H2388}{(H8686)} it fast, but it shall not endure{H6965}{(H8799)}."
Job,8,16,"He is green{H7373} before{H6440} the sun{H8121}, and his branch{H3127} shooteth forth{H3318}{(H8799)} in his garden{H1593}."
Job,8,17,"His roots{H8328} are wrapped about{H5440}{(H8792)} the heap{H1530}, and seeth{H2372}{(H8799)} the place{H1004} of stones{H68}."
Job,8,18,"If he destroy{H1104}{(H8762)} him from his place{H4725}, then it shall deny{H3584}{(H8765)} him, saying, I have not seen{H7200}{(H8804)} thee."
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy{H4885} of his way{H1870}, and out of the earth{H6083} shall others{H312} grow{H6779}{(H8799)}."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God{H410} will not cast away{H3988}{(H8799)} a perfect{H8535} man, neither will he help{H2388}{(H8686)}{H3027} the evil doers{H7489}{(H8688)}:"
Job,8,21,"Till he fill{H4390}{(H8762)} thy mouth{H6310} with laughing{H7814}, and thy lips{H8193} with rejoicing{H8643}."
Job,8,22,They that hate{H8130}{(H8802)} thee shall be clothed{H3847}{(H8799)} with shame{H1322}; and the dwelling{H168} place of the wicked{H7563} shall come to nought{H369}.
Job,9,1,"Then Job{H347} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,9,2,I know{H3045}{(H8804)} it is so of a truth{H551}: but how should man{H582} be just{H6663}{(H8799)} with God{H410}?
Job,9,3,"If he will{H2654}{(H8799)} contend{H7378}{(H8800)} with him, he cannot answer{H6030}{(H8799)} him one{H259} of a thousand{H505}."
Job,9,4,"He is wise{H2450} in heart{H3824}, and mighty{H533} in strength{H3581}: who hath hardened{H7185}{(H8689)} himself against him, and hath prospered{H7999}{(H8799)}?"
Job,9,5,"Which removeth{H6275}{(H8688)} the mountains{H2022}, and they know{H3045}{(H8804)} not: which overturneth{H2015}{(H8804)} them in his anger{H639}."
Job,9,6,"Which shaketh{H7264}{(H8688)} the earth{H776} out of her place{H4725}, and the pillars{H5982} thereof tremble{H6426}{(H8691)}."
Job,9,7,"Which commandeth{H559}{(H8802)} the sun{H2775}, and it riseth{H2224}{(H8799)} not; and sealeth up{H2856}{(H8799)} the stars{H3556}."
Job,9,8,"Which alone spreadeth out{H5186}{(H8802)} the heavens{H8064}, and treadeth{H1869}{(H8802)} upon the waves{H1116} of the sea{H3220}."
Job,9,9,"Which maketh{H6213}{(H8802)} Arcturus{H5906}, Orion{H3685}, and Pleiades{H3598}, and the chambers{H2315} of the south{H8486}."
Job,9,10,"Which doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} great things{H1419} past{H369} finding out{H2714}; yea, and wonders{H6381}{(H8737)} without number{H4557}."
Job,9,11,"Lo, he goeth{H5674}{(H8799)} by me, and I see{H7200}{(H8799)} him not: he passeth on{H2498}{(H8799)} also, but I perceive{H995}{(H8799)} him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he taketh away{H2862}{(H8799)}, who can hinder{H7725}{(H8686)} him? who will say{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What doest{H6213}{(H8799)} thou?"
Job,9,13,"If God{H433} will not withdraw{H7725}{(H8686)} his anger{H639}, the proud{H7293} helpers{H5826}{(H8802)} do stoop{H7817}{(H8804)} under him."
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer{H6030}{(H8799)} him, and choose out{H977}{(H8799)} my words{H1697} to reason with him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous{H6663}{(H8804)}, yet would I not answer{H6030}{(H8799)}, but I would make supplication{H2603}{(H8691)} to my judge{H8199}{(H8781)}."
Job,9,16,"If I had called{H7121}{(H8804)}, and he had answered{H6030}{(H8799)} me; yet would I not believe{H539}{(H8686)} that he had hearkened{H238}{(H8686)} unto my voice{H6963}."
Job,9,17,"For he breaketh{H7779}{(H8799)} me with a tempest{H8183}, and multiplieth{H7235}{(H8689)} my wounds{H6482} without cause{H2600}."
Job,9,18,"He will not suffer{H5414}{(H8799)} me to take{H7725}{(H8687)} my breath{H7307}, but filleth{H7646}{(H8686)} me with bitterness{H4472}."
Job,9,19,"If I speak of strength{H3581}, lo, he is strong{H533}: and if of judgment{H4941}, who shall set{H3259}{(H8686)} me a time to plead?"
Job,9,20,"If I justify{H6663}{(H8799)} myself, mine own mouth{H6310} shall condemn{H7561}{(H8686)} me: if I say, I am perfect{H8535}, it shall also prove me perverse{H6140}{(H8799)}."
Job,9,21,"Though I were perfect{H8535}, yet would I not know{H3045}{(H8799)} my soul{H5315}: I would despise{H3988}{(H8799)} my life{H2416}."
Job,9,22,"This is one{H259} thing, therefore I said{H559}{(H8804)} it, He destroyeth{H3615}{(H8764)} the perfect{H8535} and the wicked{H7563}."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge{H7752} slay{H4191}{(H8686)} suddenly{H6597}, he will laugh{H3932}{(H8799)} at the trial{H4531} of the innocent{H5355}."
Job,9,24,"The earth{H776} is given{H5414}{(H8738)} into the hand{H3027} of the wicked{H7563}: he covereth{H3680}{(H8762)} the faces{H6440} of the judges{H8199}{(H8802)} thereof; if not, where{H645}, and who is he?"
Job,9,25,"Now my days{H3117} are swifter{H7043}{(H8804)} than a post{H7323}{(H8801)}: they flee away{H1272}{(H8804)}, they see{H7200}{(H8804)} no good{H2896}."
Job,9,26,They are passed away{H2498}{(H8804)} as{H5973} the swift{H16} ships{H591}: as the eagle{H5404} that hasteth{H2907}{(H8799)} to the prey{H400}.
Job,9,27,"If I say{H559}{(H8800)}, I will forget{H7911}{(H8799)} my complaint{H7879}, I will leave off{H5800}{(H8799)} my heaviness{H6440}, and comfort{H1082}{(H8686)} myself:"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid{H3025}{(H8804)} of all my sorrows{H6094}, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou wilt not hold me innocent{H5352}{(H8762)}."
Job,9,29,"If I be wicked{H7561}{(H8799)}, why then labour{H3021}{(H8799)} I in vain{H1892}?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash{H7364}{(H8694)} myself with{H7950} snow water{H4325}{H1119}, and make my hands{H3709} never{H1252}{(H8676)}{H1253} so clean{H2141}{(H8689)};"
Job,9,31,"Yet{H227} shalt thou plunge{H2881}{(H8799)} me in the ditch{H7845}, and mine own clothes{H8008} shall abhor{H8581}{(H8765)} me."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man{H376}, as I am, that I should answer{H6030}{(H8799)} him, and we should come{H935}{(H8799)} together{H3162} in judgment{H4941}."
Job,9,33,"Neither is{H3426} there any daysman{H3198}{(H8688)} betwixt us, that might lay{H7896}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} upon us both{H8147}."
Job,9,34,"Let him take{H5493} his rod{H7626} away{H5493}{(H8686)} from me, and let not his fear{H367} terrify{H1204}{(H8762)} me:"
Job,9,35,"Then would I speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, and not fear{H3372}{(H8799)} him; but it is not so with me."
Job,10,1,My soul{H5315} is weary{H5354}{(H8804)} of my life{H2416}; I will leave{H5800}{(H8799)} my complaint{H7879} upon myself; I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} in the bitterness{H4751} of my soul{H5315}.
Job,10,2,"I will say{H559}{(H8799)} unto God{H433}, Do not condemn{H7561}{(H8686)} me; shew{H3045}{(H8685)} me wherefore thou contendest{H7378}{(H8799)} with me."
Job,10,3,"Is it good{H2895}{(H8804)} unto thee that thou shouldest oppress{H6231}{(H8799)}, that thou shouldest despise{H3988}{(H8799)} the work{H3018} of thine hands{H3709}, and shine{H3313}{(H8689)} upon the counsel{H6098} of the wicked{H7563}?"
Job,10,4,Hast thou eyes{H5869} of flesh{H1320}? or seest{H7200}{(H8799)} thou as man{H582} seeth{H7200}{(H8800)}?
Job,10,5,"Are thy days{H3117} as the days{H3117} of man{H582}? are thy years{H8141} as man's{H1397} days{H3117},"
Job,10,6,"That thou enquirest{H1245}{(H8762)} after mine iniquity{H5771}, and searchest{H1875}{(H8799)} after my sin{H2403}?"
Job,10,7,Thou knowest{H1847} that I am not wicked{H7561}{(H8799)}; and there is none that can deliver{H5337}{(H8688)} out of thine hand{H3027}.
Job,10,8,Thine hands{H3027} have made{H6087}{(H8765)} me and fashioned{H6213}{(H8799)} me together{H3162} round about{H5439}; yet thou dost destroy{H1104}{(H8762)} me.
Job,10,9,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)}, I beseech thee, that thou hast made{H6213}{(H8804)} me as the clay{H2563}; and wilt thou bring{H7725} me into dust{H6083} again{H7725}{(H8686)}?"
Job,10,10,"Hast thou not poured me out{H5413}{(H8686)} as milk{H2461}, and curdled{H7087}{(H8686)} me like cheese{H1385}?"
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed{H3847}{(H8686)} me with skin{H5785} and flesh{H1320}, and hast fenced{H7753}{(H8787)} me with bones{H6106} and sinews{H1517}."
Job,10,12,"Thou hast granted{H6213}{(H8804)} me life{H2416} and favour{H2617}, and thy visitation{H6486} hath preserved{H8104}{(H8804)} my spirit{H7307}."
Job,10,13,And these things hast thou hid{H6845}{(H8804)} in thine heart{H3824}: I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that this is with thee.
Job,10,14,"If I sin{H2398}{(H8804)}, then thou markest{H8104}{(H8804)} me, and thou wilt not acquit{H5352}{(H8762)} me from mine iniquity{H5771}."
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked{H7561}{(H8804)}, woe{H480} unto me; and if I be righteous{H6663}{(H8804)}, yet will I not lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} my head{H7218}. I am full{H7649} of confusion{H7036}; therefore see{H7202}{(H8798)}{(H8676)}{H7200}{(H8798)} thou mine affliction{H6040};"
Job,10,16,For it increaseth{H1342}{(H8799)}. Thou huntest{H6679}{(H8799)} me as a fierce lion{H7826}: and again{H7725}{(H8799)} thou shewest thyself marvellous{H6381}{(H8691)} upon me.
Job,10,17,"Thou renewest{H2318}{(H8762)} thy witnesses{H5707} against me, and increasest{H7235}{(H8686)} thine indignation{H3708} upon me{H5978}; changes{H2487} and war{H6635} are against me."
Job,10,18,"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the womb{H7358}? Oh that I had given up the ghost{H1478}{(H8799)}, and no eye{H5869} had seen{H7200}{(H8799)} me!"
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried{H2986}{(H8714)} from the womb{H990} to the grave{H6913}.
Job,10,20,"Are not my days{H3117} few{H4592}? cease{H2308}{(H8798)}{(H8675)}{H2308}{(H8799)} then, and let me alone{H7896}{(H8798)}{(H8675)}{H7896}{(H8799)}, that I may take comfort{H1082}{(H8686)} a little{H4592},"
Job,10,21,"Before I go{H3212}{(H8799)} whence I shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)}, even to the land{H776} of darkness{H2822} and the shadow of death{H6757};"
Job,10,22,"A land{H776} of darkness{H5890}, as darkness{H652} itself; and of the shadow of death{H6757}, without any order{H5468}, and where the light{H3313}{(H8686)} is as darkness{H652}."
Job,11,1,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Zophar{H6691} the Naamathite{H5284}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude{H7230} of words{H1697} be answered{H6030}{(H8735)}? and should a man{H376} full of talk{H8193} be justified{H6663}{(H8799)}?
Job,11,3,"Should thy lies{H907} make{H2790} men{H4962} hold their peace{H2790}{(H8686)}? and when thou mockest{H3932}{(H8799)}, shall no man make thee ashamed{H3637}{(H8688)}?"
Job,11,4,"For thou hast said{H559}{(H8799)}, My doctrine{H3948} is pure{H2134}, and I am clean{H1249} in thine eyes{H5869}."
Job,11,5,"But{H199} oh that{H5414}{(H8799)} God{H433} would speak{H1696}{(H8763)}, and open{H6605}{(H8799)} his lips{H8193} against thee;"
Job,11,6,"And that he would shew{H5046}{(H8686)} thee the secrets{H8587} of wisdom{H2451}, that they are double{H3718} to that which is{H8454}! Know{H3045}{(H8798)} therefore that God{H433} exacteth{H5382}{(H8686)} of thee less than thine iniquity{H5771} deserveth."
Job,11,7,Canst thou by searching{H2714} find out{H4672}{(H8799)} God{H433}? canst thou find{H4672}{(H8799)} out the Almighty{H7706} unto perfection{H8503}?
Job,11,8,It is as high{H1363} as heaven{H8064}; what canst thou do{H6466}{(H8799)}? deeper{H6013} than hell{H7585}; what canst thou know{H3045}{(H8799)}?
Job,11,9,"The measure{H4055} thereof is longer{H752} than the earth{H776}, and broader{H7342} than the sea{H3220}."
Job,11,10,"If he cut off{H2498}{(H8799)}, and shut up{H5462}{(H8686)}, or gather together{H6950}{(H8686)}, then who can hinder{H7725}{(H8686)} him?"
Job,11,11,For he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} vain{H7723} men{H4962}: he seeth{H7200}{(H8799)} wickedness{H205} also; will he not then consider{H995}{(H8709)} it?
Job,11,12,"For vain{H5014}{(H8803)} man{H376} would be wise{H3823}{(H8735)}, though man{H120} be born{H3205}{(H8735)} like a wild ass's{H6501} colt{H5895}."
Job,11,13,"If thou prepare{H3559}{(H8689)} thine heart{H3820}, and stretch{H6566}{(H8804)} out thine hands{H3709} toward him;"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity{H205} be in thine hand{H3027}, put it far away{H7368}{(H8685)}, and let not wickedness{H5766} dwell{H7931}{(H8686)} in thy tabernacles{H168}."
Job,11,15,"For then shalt thou lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} thy face{H6440} without spot{H3971}; yea, thou shalt be stedfast{H3332}{(H8716)}, and shalt not fear{H3372}{(H8799)}:"
Job,11,16,"Because thou shalt forget{H7911}{(H8799)} thy misery{H5999}, and remember{H2142}{(H8799)} it as waters{H4325} that pass away{H5674}{(H8804)}:"
Job,11,17,"And thine age{H2465} shall be clearer{H6965}{(H8799)} than the noonday{H6672}; thou shalt shine forth{H5774}{(H8799)}, thou shalt be as the morning{H1242}."
Job,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure{H982}{(H8804)}, because there is{H3426} hope{H8615}; yea, thou shalt dig{H2658}{(H8804)} about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest{H7901}{(H8799)} in safety{H983}."
Job,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down{H7257}{(H8804)}, and none shall make thee afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}; yea, many{H7227} shall make suit{H2470}{(H8765)} unto thee{H6440}."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes{H5869} of the wicked{H7563} shall fail{H3615}{(H8799)}, and they shall not escape{H6}{(H8804)}{H4498}, and their hope{H8615} shall be as the giving up{H4646} of the ghost{H5315}."
Job,12,1,"And Job{H347} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,12,2,"No doubt{H551} but ye are the people{H5971}, and wisdom{H2451} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} with you."
Job,12,3,"But{H1571} I have understanding{H3824} as well as you; I am not inferior{H5307}{(H8802)} to you: yea, who knoweth not such things{H3644} as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am as one mocked{H7814} of his neighbour{H7453}, who calleth{H7121}{(H8802)} upon God{H433}, and he answereth{H6030}{(H8799)} him: the just{H6662} upright{H8549} man is laughed to scorn{H7814}."
Job,12,5,He that is ready{H3559}{(H8737)} to slip{H4571}{(H8802)} with his feet{H7272} is as a lamp{H3940} despised{H937} in the thought{H6248} of him that is at ease{H7600}.
Job,12,6,"The tabernacles{H168} of robbers{H7703}{(H8802)} prosper{H7951}{(H8799)}, and they that provoke{H7264}{(H8688)} God{H410} are secure{H987}; into whose hand{H3027} God{H433} bringeth{H935}{(H8689)} abundantly."
Job,12,7,"But{H199} ask{H7592}{(H8798)} now the beasts{H929}, and they shall teach{H3384}{(H8686)} thee; and the fowls{H5775} of the air{H8064}, and they shall tell{H5046}{(H8686)} thee:"
Job,12,8,"Or speak{H7878}{(H8798)} to the earth{H776}, and it shall teach{H3384}{(H8686)} thee: and the fishes{H1709} of the sea{H3220} shall declare{H5608}{(H8762)} unto thee."
Job,12,9,Who knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} not in all these that the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} hath wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} this?
Job,12,10,"In whose hand{H3027} is the soul{H5315} of every living thing{H2416}, and the breath{H7307} of all mankind{H376}{H1320}."
Job,12,11,Doth not the ear{H241} try{H974}{(H8799)} words{H4405}? and the mouth{H2441} taste{H2938}{(H8799)} his meat{H400}?
Job,12,12,With the ancient{H3453} is wisdom{H2451}; and in length{H753} of days{H3117} understanding{H8394}.
Job,12,13,"With him is wisdom{H2451} and strength{H1369}, he hath counsel{H6098} and understanding{H8394}."
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaketh down{H2040}{(H8799)}, and it cannot be built again{H1129}{(H8735)}: he shutteth up{H5462}{(H8799)} a man{H376}, and there can be no opening{H6605}{(H8735)}."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholdeth{H6113}{(H8799)} the waters{H4325}, and they dry up{H3001}{(H8799)}: also he sendeth them out{H7971}{(H8762)}, and they overturn{H2015}{(H8799)} the earth{H776}."
Job,12,16,With him is strength{H5797} and wisdom{H8454}: the deceived{H7683}{(H8802)} and the deceiver{H7686}{(H8688)} are his.
Job,12,17,"He leadeth{H3212}{(H8688)} counsellors{H3289}{(H8802)} away spoiled{H7758}, and maketh the judges{H8199}{(H8802)} fools{H1984}{(H8779)}."
Job,12,18,"He looseth{H6605}{(H8765)} the bond{H4148} of kings{H4428}, and girdeth{H631}{(H8799)} their loins{H4975} with a girdle{H232}."
Job,12,19,"He leadeth{H3212}{(H8688)} princes{H3548} away spoiled{H7758}, and overthroweth{H5557}{(H8762)} the mighty{H386}."
Job,12,20,"He removeth away{H5493}{(H8688)} the speech{H8193} of the trusty{H539}{(H8737)}, and taketh away{H3947}{(H8799)} the understanding{H2940} of the aged{H2205}."
Job,12,21,"He poureth{H8210}{(H8802)} contempt{H937} upon princes{H5081}, and weakeneth{H7503}{(H8765)} the strength{H4206} of the mighty{H650}."
Job,12,22,"He discovereth{H1540}{(H8764)} deep things{H6013} out of darkness{H2822}, and bringeth out{H3318}{(H8686)} to light{H216} the shadow of death{H6757}."
Job,12,23,"He increaseth{H7679}{(H8688)} the nations{H1471}, and destroyeth{H6}{(H8762)} them: he enlargeth{H7849}{(H8802)} the nations{H1471}, and straiteneth{H5148}{(H8686)} them again."
Job,12,24,"He taketh away{H5493}{(H8688)} the heart{H3820} of the chief{H7218} of the people{H5971} of the earth{H776}, and causeth them to wander{H8582}{(H8686)} in a wilderness{H8414} where there is no way{H1870}."
Job,12,25,"They grope{H4959}{(H8762)} in the dark{H2822} without light{H216}, and he maketh them to stagger{H8582}{(H8686)} like a drunken{H7910} man."
Job,13,1,"Lo, mine eye{H5869} hath seen{H7200}{(H8804)} all this, mine ear{H241} hath heard{H8085}{(H8804)} and understood{H995}{(H8799)} it."
Job,13,2,"What ye know{H1847}, the same do I know{H3045}{(H8804)} also: I am not inferior{H5307}{(H8802)} unto you."
Job,13,3,"Surely{H199} I would speak{H1696}{(H8762)} to the Almighty{H7706}, and I desire{H2654}{(H8799)} to reason{H3198}{(H8687)} with God{H410}."
Job,13,4,"But{H199} ye are forgers{H2950}{(H8802)} of lies{H8267}, ye are all physicians{H7495}{(H8802)} of no value{H457}."
Job,13,5,O that{H5414}{(H8799)} ye would altogether{H2790}{(H8687)} hold your peace{H2790}{(H8686)}! and it should be your wisdom{H2451}.
Job,13,6,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now my reasoning{H8433}, and hearken{H7181}{(H8685)} to the pleadings{H7379} of my lips{H8193}."
Job,13,7,Will ye speak{H1696}{(H8762)} wickedly{H5766} for God{H410}? and talk{H1696}{(H8762)} deceitfully{H7423} for him?
Job,13,8,Will ye accept{H5375}{(H8799)} his person{H6440}? will ye contend{H7378}{(H8799)} for God{H410}?
Job,13,9,"Is it good{H2895}{(H8804)} that he should search you out{H2713}{(H8799)}? or as one man{H582} mocketh{H2048}{(H8763)} another, do ye so mock{H2048}{(H8762)} him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely{H3198}{(H8687)} reprove{H3198}{(H8686)} you, if ye do secretly{H5643} accept{H5375}{(H8799)} persons{H6440}."
Job,13,11,Shall not his excellency{H7613} make you afraid{H1204}{(H8762)}? and his dread{H6343} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} upon you?
Job,13,12,"Your remembrances{H2146} are like{H4912} unto ashes{H665}, your bodies{H1354} to bodies{H1354} of clay{H2563}."
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace{H2790}{(H8685)}, let me alone, that I may speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, and let come{H5674}{(H8799)} on me what will."
Job,13,14,"Wherefore do I take{H5375}{(H8799)} my flesh{H1320} in my teeth{H8127}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} my life{H5315} in mine hand{H3709}?"
Job,13,15,"Though{H2005} he slay{H6991}{(H8799)} me, yet will I trust{H3176}{(H8762)} in him: but I will maintain{H3198}{(H8686)} mine own ways{H1870} before{H6440} him."
Job,13,16,He also shall be my salvation{H3444}: for an hypocrite{H2611} shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him.
Job,13,17,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} diligently{H8085}{(H8800)} my speech{H4405}, and my declaration{H262} with your ears{H241}."
Job,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered{H6186}{(H8804)} my cause{H4941}; I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I shall be justified{H6663}{(H8799)}."
Job,13,19,"Who is he that will plead{H7378}{(H8799)} with me? for now, if I hold my tongue{H2790}{(H8686)}, I shall give up the ghost{H1478}{(H8799)}."
Job,13,20,Only do{H6213}{(H8799)} not two{H8147} things unto me: then will I not hide{H5641}{(H8735)} myself from thee{H6440}.
Job,13,21,Withdraw{H7368} thine hand{H3709} far{H7368}{(H8685)} from me: and let not thy dread{H367} make me afraid{H1204}{(H8762)}.
Job,13,22,"Then call{H7121}{(H8798)} thou, and I will answer{H6030}{(H8799)}: or let me speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, and answer{H7725}{(H8685)} thou me."
Job,13,23,How many are mine iniquities{H5771} and sins{H2403}? make me to know{H3045}{(H8685)} my transgression{H6588} and my sin{H2403}.
Job,13,24,"Wherefore hidest{H5641}{(H8686)} thou thy face{H6440}, and holdest{H2803}{(H8799)} me for thine enemy{H341}{(H8802)}?"
Job,13,25,Wilt thou break{H6206}{(H8799)} a leaf{H5929} driven to and fro{H5086}{(H8737)}? and wilt thou pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} the dry{H3002} stubble{H7179}?
Job,13,26,"For thou writest{H3789}{(H8799)} bitter things{H4846} against me, and makest me to possess{H3423}{(H8686)} the iniquities{H5771} of my youth{H5271}."
Job,13,27,"Thou puttest{H7760}{(H8799)} my feet{H7272} also in the stocks{H5465}, and lookest narrowly{H8104}{(H8799)} unto all my paths{H734}; thou settest a print{H2707}{(H8691)} upon the heels{H8328} of my feet{H7272}."
Job,13,28,"And he, as a rotten thing{H7538}, consumeth{H1086}{(H8799)}, as a garment{H899} that is moth{H6211} eaten{H398}{(H8804)}."
Job,14,1,"Man{H120} that is born{H3205}{(H8803)} of a woman{H802} is of few{H7116} days{H3117}, and full{H7649} of trouble{H7267}."
Job,14,2,"He cometh forth{H3318}{(H8804)} like a flower{H6731}, and is cut down{H5243}{(H8799)}: he fleeth{H1272}{(H8799)} also as a shadow{H6738}, and continueth{H5975}{(H8799)} not."
Job,14,3,"And dost thou open{H6491}{(H8804)} thine eyes{H5869} upon such an one{H2088}, and bringest{H935}{(H8686)} me into judgment{H4941} with thee?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring{H5414}{(H8799)} a clean{H2889} thing out of an unclean{H2931}? not one{H259}.
Job,14,5,"Seeing{H518} his days{H3117} are determined{H2782}{(H8803)}, the number{H4557} of his months{H2320} are with thee, thou hast appointed{H6213}{(H8804)} his bounds{H2706} that he cannot pass{H5674}{(H8799)};"
Job,14,6,"Turn{H8159}{(H8798)} from him, that he may rest{H2308}{(H8799)}, till he shall accomplish{H7521}{(H8799)}, as an hireling{H7916}, his day{H3117}."
Job,14,7,"For there is{H3426} hope{H8615} of a tree{H6086}, if it be cut down{H3772}{(H8735)}, that it will sprout again{H2498}{(H8686)}, and that the tender branch{H3127} thereof will not cease{H2308}{(H8799)}."
Job,14,8,"Though the root{H8328} thereof wax old{H2204}{(H8686)} in the earth{H776}, and the stock{H1503} thereof die{H4191}{(H8799)} in the ground{H6083};"
Job,14,9,"Yet through the scent{H7381} of water{H4325} it will bud{H6524}{(H8686)}, and bring forth{H6213}{(H8804)} boughs{H7105} like a plant{H5194}."
Job,14,10,"But man{H1397} dieth{H4191}{(H8799)}, and wasteth away{H2522}{(H8799)}: yea, man{H120} giveth up the ghost{H1478}{(H8799)}, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As the waters{H4325} fail{H235}{(H8804)} from the sea{H3220}, and the flood{H5104} decayeth{H2717}{(H8799)} and drieth up{H3001}{(H8804)}:"
Job,14,12,"So man{H376} lieth down{H7901}{(H8804)}, and riseth{H6965}{(H8799)} not: till the heavens{H8064} be no more{H1115}, they shall not awake{H6974}{(H8686)}, nor be raised out{H5782}{(H8735)} of their sleep{H8142}."
Job,14,13,"O that{H5414}{(H8799)} thou wouldest hide{H6845}{(H8686)} me in the grave{H7585}, that thou wouldest keep me secret{H5641}{(H8686)}, until thy wrath{H639} be past{H7725}{(H8800)}, that thou wouldest appoint{H7896}{(H8799)} me a set time{H2706}, and remember{H2142}{(H8799)} me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man{H1397} die{H4191}{(H8799)}, shall he live{H2421}{(H8799)} again? all the days{H3117} of my appointed time{H6635} will I wait{H3176}{(H8762)}, till my change{H2487} come{H935}{(H8800)}."
Job,14,15,"Thou shalt call{H7121}{(H8799)}, and I will answer{H6030}{(H8799)} thee: thou wilt have a desire{H3700}{(H8799)} to the work{H4639} of thine hands{H3027}."
Job,14,16,For now thou numberest{H5608}{(H8799)} my steps{H6806}: dost thou not watch{H8104}{(H8799)} over my sin{H2403}?
Job,14,17,"My transgression{H6588} is sealed up{H2856}{(H8803)} in a bag{H6872}, and thou sewest up{H2950}{(H8799)} mine iniquity{H5771}."
Job,14,18,"And surely{H199} the mountain{H2022} falling{H5307}{(H8802)} cometh to nought{H5034}{(H8799)}, and the rock{H6697} is removed{H6275}{(H8799)} out of his place{H4725}."
Job,14,19,The waters{H4325} wear{H7833}{(H8804)} the stones{H68}: thou washest away{H7857}{(H8799)} the things which grow{H5599} out of the dust{H6083} of the earth{H776}; and thou destroyest{H6}{(H8689)} the hope{H8615} of man{H582}.
Job,14,20,"Thou prevailest{H8630}{(H8799)} for ever{H5331} against him, and he passeth{H1980}{(H8799)}: thou changest{H8138}{(H8764)} his countenance{H6440}, and sendest him away{H7971}{(H8762)}."
Job,14,21,"His sons{H1121} come to honour{H3513}{(H8799)}, and he knoweth{H3045}{(H8799)} it not; and they are brought low{H6819}{(H8799)}, but he perceiveth{H995}{(H8799)} it not of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh{H1320} upon him shall have pain{H3510}{(H8799)}, and his soul{H5315} within him shall mourn{H56}{(H8799)}."
Job,15,1,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Eliphaz{H464} the Temanite{H8489}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,15,2,"Should a wise man{H2450} utter{H6030}{(H8799)} vain{H7307} knowledge{H1847}, and fill{H4390}{(H8762)} his belly{H990} with the east wind{H6921}?"
Job,15,3,Should he reason{H3198}{(H8687)} with unprofitable{H5532}{(H8799)} talk{H1697}? or with speeches{H4405} wherewith he can do no good{H3276}{(H8686)}?
Job,15,4,"Yea, thou castest off{H6565}{(H8686)} fear{H3374}, and restrainest{H1639}{(H8799)} prayer{H7881} before{H6440} God{H410}."
Job,15,5,"For thy mouth{H6310} uttereth{H502}{(H8762)} thine iniquity{H5771}, and thou choosest{H977}{(H8799)} the tongue{H3956} of the crafty{H6175}."
Job,15,6,"Thine own mouth{H6310} condemneth{H7561}{(H8686)} thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips{H8193} testify{H6030}{(H8799)} against thee."
Job,15,7,Art thou the first{H7223}{(H8675)}{H7223} man{H120} that was born{H3205}{(H8735)}? or wast thou made{H2342}{(H8797)} before{H6440} the hills{H1389}?
Job,15,8,Hast thou heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the secret{H5475} of God{H433}? and dost thou restrain{H1639}{(H8799)} wisdom{H2451} to thyself?
Job,15,9,"What knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou, that we know{H3045}{(H8799)} not? what understandest{H995}{(H8799)} thou, which is not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us are both the grayheaded{H7867}{(H8802)} and very aged{H3453} men, much{H3524} elder{H3117} than thy father{H1}."
Job,15,11,Are the consolations{H8575} of God{H410} small{H4592} with thee? is there any secret{H328} thing{H1697} with thee?
Job,15,12,"Why doth thine heart{H3820} carry thee away{H3947}{(H8799)}? and what do thy eyes{H5869} wink at{H7335}{(H8799)},"
Job,15,13,"That thou turnest{H7725}{(H8686)} thy spirit{H7307} against God{H410}, and lettest such words{H4405} go out{H3318}{(H8689)} of thy mouth{H6310}?"
Job,15,14,"What is man{H582}, that he should be clean{H2135}{(H8799)}? and he which is born{H3205}{(H8803)} of a woman{H802}, that he should be righteous{H6663}{(H8799)}?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, he putteth no trust{H539}{(H8686)} in his saints{H6918}; yea, the heavens{H8064} are not clean{H2141}{(H8804)} in his sight{H5869}."
Job,15,16,"How much more abominable{H8581}{(H8737)} and filthy{H444}{(H8737)} is man{H376}, which drinketh{H8354}{(H8802)} iniquity{H5766}{(H8675)}{H5766} like water{H4325}?"
Job,15,17,"I will shew{H2331}{(H8762)} thee, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} me; and that which I have seen{H2372}{(H8804)} I will declare{H5608}{(H8762)};"
Job,15,18,"Which wise{H2450} men have told{H5046}{(H8686)} from their fathers{H1}, and have not hid{H3582}{(H8765)} it:"
Job,15,19,"Unto whom alone the earth{H776} was given{H5414}{(H8738)}, and no stranger{H2114}{(H8801)} passed{H5674}{(H8804)} among{H8432} them."
Job,15,20,"The wicked{H7563} man travaileth{H2342}{(H8711)} with pain all his days{H3117}, and the number{H4557} of years{H8141} is hidden{H6845}{(H8738)} to the oppressor{H6184}."
Job,15,21,A dreadful{H6343} sound{H6963} is in his ears{H241}: in prosperity{H7965} the destroyer{H7703}{(H8802)} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} upon him.
Job,15,22,"He believeth{H539}{(H8686)} not that he shall return{H7725}{(H8800)} out of darkness{H2822}, and he is waited{H6822}{(H8803)} for of the sword{H2719}."
Job,15,23,"He wandereth abroad{H5074}{(H8802)} for bread{H3899}, saying, Where is it? he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} that the day{H3117} of darkness{H2822} is ready{H3559}{(H8737)} at his hand{H3027}."
Job,15,24,"Trouble{H6862} and anguish{H4691} shall make him afraid{H1204}{(H8762)}; they shall prevail{H8630}{(H8799)} against him, as a king{H4428} ready{H6264} to the battle{H3593}."
Job,15,25,"For he stretcheth out{H5186}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} against God{H410}, and strengtheneth{H1396}{(H8691)} himself against the Almighty{H7706}."
Job,15,26,"He runneth{H7323}{(H8799)} upon him, even on his neck{H6677}, upon the thick{H5672} bosses{H1354} of his bucklers{H4043}:"
Job,15,27,"Because he covereth{H3680}{(H8765)} his face{H6440} with his fatness{H2459}, and maketh{H6213}{(H8799)} collops of fat{H6371} on his flanks{H3689}."
Job,15,28,"And he dwelleth{H7931}{(H8799)} in desolate{H3582}{(H8737)} cities{H5892}, and in houses{H1004} which no man inhabiteth{H3427}{(H8799)}, which are ready{H6257}{(H8694)} to become heaps{H1530}."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich{H6238}{(H8799)}, neither shall his substance{H2428} continue{H6965}{(H8799)}, neither shall he prolong{H5186}{(H8799)} the perfection{H4512} thereof upon the earth{H776}."
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart{H5493}{(H8799)} out of darkness{H2822}; the flame{H7957} shall dry up{H3001}{(H8762)} his branches{H3127}, and by the breath{H7307} of his mouth{H6310} shall he go away{H5493}{(H8799)}."
Job,15,31,Let not him that is deceived{H8582}{(H8738)} trust{H539}{(H8686)} in vanity{H7723}: for vanity{H7723} shall be his recompence{H8545}.
Job,15,32,"It shall be accomplished{H4390}{(H8735)} before{H3808} his time{H3117}, and his branch{H3712} shall not be green{H7488}."
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off{H2554}{(H8799)} his unripe grape{H1154} as the vine{H1612}, and shall cast off{H7993}{(H8686)} his flower{H5328} as the olive{H2132}."
Job,15,34,"For the congregation{H5712} of hypocrites{H2611} shall be desolate{H1565}, and fire{H784} shall consume{H398}{(H8804)} the tabernacles{H168} of bribery{H7810}."
Job,15,35,"They conceive{H2029}{(H8800)} mischief{H5999}, and bring forth{H3205}{(H8800)} vanity{H205}, and their belly{H990} prepareth{H3559}{(H8686)} deceit{H4820}."
Job,16,1,"Then Job{H347} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,16,2,I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} many such things{H7227}: miserable{H5999} comforters{H5162}{(H8764)} are ye all.
Job,16,3,Shall vain{H7307} words{H1697} have an end{H7093}? or what emboldeneth{H4834}{(H8686)} thee that thou answerest{H6030}{(H8799)}?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak{H1696}{(H8762)} as ye do: if{H3863} your soul{H5315} were{H3426} in my soul's{H5315} stead, I could heap up{H2266}{(H8686)} words{H4405} against you, and shake{H5128}{(H8686)} mine head{H7218} at{H1119} you."
Job,16,5,"But I would strengthen{H553}{(H8762)} you with{H1119} my mouth{H6310}, and the moving{H5205} of my lips{H8193} should asswage{H2820}{(H8799)} your grief."
Job,16,6,"Though I speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, my grief{H3511} is not asswaged{H2820}{(H8735)}: and though I forbear{H2308}{(H8799)}, what am I eased{H1980}{(H8799)}?"
Job,16,7,But now he hath made me weary{H3811}{(H8689)}: thou hast made desolate{H8074}{(H8689)} all my company{H5712}.
Job,16,8,"And thou hast filled me with wrinkles{H7059}{(H8799)}, which is a witness{H5707} against me: and my leanness{H3585} rising up{H6965}{(H8799)} in me beareth witness{H6030}{(H8799)} to my face{H6440}."
Job,16,9,"He teareth{H2963}{(H8804)} me in his wrath{H639}, who hateth{H7852}{(H8799)} me: he gnasheth{H2786}{(H8804)} upon me with his teeth{H8127}; mine enemy{H6862} sharpeneth{H3913}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869} upon me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped{H6473}{(H8804)} upon me with their mouth{H6310}; they have smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} me upon the cheek{H3895} reproachfully{H2781}; they have gathered{H4390}{(H8691)} themselves together{H3162} against me.
Job,16,11,"God{H410} hath delivered{H5462}{(H8686)} me to the ungodly{H5760}, and turned me over{H3399}{(H8804)} into the hands{H3027} of the wicked{H7563}."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease{H7961}, but he hath broken me asunder{H6565}{(H8770)}: he hath also taken{H270}{(H8804)} me by my neck{H6203}, and shaken me to pieces{H6327}{(H8770)}, and set me up{H6965}{(H8686)} for his mark{H4307}."
Job,16,13,"His archers{H7228} compass me round about{H5437}{(H8799)}, he cleaveth{H6398} my reins{H3629} asunder{H6398}{(H8762)}, and doth not spare{H2550}{(H8799)}; he poureth out{H8210}{(H8799)} my gall{H4845} upon the ground{H776}."
Job,16,14,"He breaketh{H6555}{(H8799)} me with breach{H6556} upon{H6440} breach{H6556}, he runneth{H7323}{(H8799)} upon me like a giant{H1368}."
Job,16,15,"I have sewed{H8609}{(H8804)} sackcloth{H8242} upon my skin{H1539}, and defiled{H5953}{(H8782)} my horn{H7161} in the dust{H6083}."
Job,16,16,"My face{H6440} is foul{H2560}{(H8777)} with weeping{H1065}, and on my eyelids{H6079} is the shadow of death{H6757};"
Job,16,17,Not for any injustice{H2555} in mine hands{H3709}: also my prayer{H8605} is pure{H2134}.
Job,16,18,"O earth{H776}, cover{H3680}{(H8762)} not thou my blood{H1818}, and let my cry{H2201} have no place{H4725}."
Job,16,19,"Also now, behold, my witness{H5707} is in heaven{H8064}, and my record{H7717} is on high{H4791}."
Job,16,20,My friends{H7453} scorn{H3887}{(H8688)} me: but mine eye{H5869} poureth out{H1811}{(H8804)} tears unto God{H433}.
Job,16,21,"O that one might plead{H3198}{(H8686)} for a man{H1397} with God{H433}, as a man{H120} pleadeth for his neighbour{H1121}{H7453}!"
Job,16,22,"When a few{H4557} years{H8141} are come{H857}{(H8799)}, then I shall go{H1980}{(H8799)} the way{H734} whence I shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)}."
Job,17,1,"My breath{H7307} is corrupt{H2254}{(H8795)}, my days{H3117} are extinct{H2193}{(H8738)}, the graves{H6913} are ready for me."
Job,17,2,Are there not mockers{H2049} with me? and doth not mine eye{H5869} continue{H3885}{(H8799)} in their provocation{H4784}{(H8687)}?
Job,17,3,"Lay down{H7760}{(H8798)} now, put me in a surety{H6148}{(H8798)} with thee; who is he that will strike{H8628}{(H8735)} hands{H3027} with me?"
Job,17,4,For thou hast hid{H6845}{(H8804)} their heart{H3820} from understanding{H7922}: therefore shalt thou not exalt{H7311}{(H8787)} them.
Job,17,5,"He that speaketh{H5046}{(H8686)} flattery{H2506} to his friends{H7453}, even the eyes{H5869} of his children{H1121} shall fail{H3615}{(H8799)}."
Job,17,6,He hath made{H3322}{(H8689)} me also a byword{H4914} of the people{H5971}; and aforetime{H6440} I was as a tabret{H8611}.
Job,17,7,"Mine eye{H5869} also is dim{H3543}{(H8799)} by reason of sorrow{H3708}, and all my members{H3338} are as a shadow{H6738}."
Job,17,8,"Upright{H3477} men shall be astonied{H8074}{(H8799)} at this, and the innocent{H5355} shall stir up{H5782}{(H8709)} himself against the hypocrite{H2611}."
Job,17,9,"The righteous{H6662} also shall hold{H270}{(H8799)} on his way{H1870}, and he that hath clean{H2890} hands{H3027} shall be{H3254}{(H8686)} stronger and stronger{H555}."
Job,17,10,"But{H199} as for you all, do ye return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and come now{H935}{(H8798)}: for I cannot find{H4672}{(H8799)} one wise{H2450} man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days{H3117} are past{H5674}{(H8804)}, my purposes{H2154} are broken off{H5423}{(H8738)}, even the thoughts{H4180} of my heart{H3824}."
Job,17,12,They change{H7760}{(H8799)} the night{H3915} into day{H3117}: the light{H216} is short{H7138} because{H6440} of darkness{H2822}.
Job,17,13,"If I wait{H6960}{(H8762)}, the grave{H7585} is mine house{H1004}: I have made{H7502}{(H8765)} my bed{H3326} in the darkness{H2822}."
Job,17,14,"I have said{H7121}{(H8804)} to corruption{H7845}, Thou art my father{H1}: to the worm{H7415}, Thou art my mother{H517}, and my sister{H269}."
Job,17,15,"And where is now{H645} my hope{H8615}? as for my hope{H8615}, who shall see{H7789}{(H8799)} it?"
Job,17,16,"They shall go down{H3381}{(H8799)} to the bars{H905} of the pit{H7585}, when our rest{H5183} together{H3162} is in the dust{H6083}."
Job,18,1,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Bildad{H1085} the Shuhite{H7747}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,18,2,"How long{H5704} will it be ere ye make{H7760}{(H8799)} an end{H7078} of words{H4405}? mark{H995}{(H8799)}, and afterwards{H310} we will speak{H1696}{(H8762)}."
Job,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted{H2803}{(H8738)} as beasts{H929}, and reputed vile{H2933}{(H8738)} in your sight{H5869}?"
Job,18,4,He teareth{H2963}{(H8802)} himself{H5315} in his anger{H639}: shall the earth{H776} be forsaken{H5800}{(H8735)} for thee? and shall the rock{H6697} be removed{H6275}{(H8799)} out of his place{H4725}?
Job,18,5,"Yea, the light{H216} of the wicked{H7563} shall be put out{H1846}{(H8799)}, and the spark{H7632} of his fire{H784} shall not shine{H5050}{(H8799)}."
Job,18,6,"The light{H216} shall be dark{H2821}{(H8804)} in his tabernacle{H168}, and his candle{H5216} shall be put out{H1846}{(H8799)} with him."
Job,18,7,"The steps{H6806} of his strength{H202} shall be straitened{H3334}{(H8799)}, and his own counsel{H6098} shall cast him down{H7993}{(H8686)}."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast{H7971}{(H8795)} into a net{H7568} by his own feet{H7272}, and he walketh{H1980}{(H8691)} upon a snare{H7639}."
Job,18,9,"The gin{H6341} shall take{H270}{(H8799)} him by the heel{H6119}, and the robber{H6782} shall prevail{H2388}{(H8686)} against him."
Job,18,10,"The snare{H2256} is laid{H2934}{(H8803)} for him in the ground{H776}, and a trap{H4434} for him in the way{H5410}."
Job,18,11,"Terrors{H1091} shall make him afraid{H1204}{(H8765)} on every side{H5439}, and shall drive{H6327}{(H8689)} him to his feet{H7272}."
Job,18,12,"His strength{H202} shall be hungerbitten{H7457}, and destruction{H343} shall be ready{H3559}{(H8737)} at his side{H6763}."
Job,18,13,It shall devour{H398}{(H8799)} the strength{H905} of his skin{H5785}: even the firstborn{H1060} of death{H4194} shall devour{H398}{(H8799)} his strength{H905}.
Job,18,14,"His confidence{H4009} shall be rooted out{H5423}{(H8735)} of his tabernacle{H168}, and it shall bring{H6805}{(H8686)} him to the king{H4428} of terrors{H1091}."

Job,22,4,Will he reprove{H3198}{(H8686)} thee for fear{H3374} of thee? will he enter{H935}{(H8799)} with thee into judgment{H4941}?
Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness{H7451} great{H7227}? and thine iniquities{H5771} infinite{H7093}?
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken a pledge{H2254}{(H8799)} from thy brother{H251} for nought{H2600}, and stripped{H6584}{(H8686)} the naked{H6174} of their clothing{H899}."
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water{H4325} to the weary{H5889} to drink{H8248}{(H8686)}, and thou hast withholden{H4513}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} from the hungry{H7457}."
Job,22,8,"But as for the mighty{H2220} man{H376}, he had the earth{H776}; and the honourable man{H5375}{(H8803)}{H6440} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} in it."
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent{H7971}{(H8765)} widows{H490} away empty{H7387}, and the arms{H2220} of the fatherless{H3490} have been broken{H1792}{(H8792)}."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares{H6341} are round about{H5439} thee, and sudden{H6597} fear{H6343} troubleth{H926}{(H8762)} thee;"
Job,22,11,"Or darkness{H2822}, that thou canst not see{H7200}{(H8799)}; and abundance{H8229} of waters{H4325} cover{H3680}{(H8762)} thee."
Job,22,12,"Is not God{H433} in the height{H1363} of heaven{H8064}? and behold{H7200}{(H8798)} the height{H7218} of the stars{H3556}, how high{H7311}{(H8804)} they are!"
Job,22,13,"And thou sayest{H559}{(H8804)}, How doth God{H410} know{H3045}{(H8804)}? can he judge{H8199}{(H8799)} through the dark cloud{H6205}?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds{H5645} are a covering{H5643} to him, that he seeth{H7200}{(H8799)} not; and he walketh{H1980}{(H8691)} in the circuit{H2329} of heaven{H8064}."
Job,22,15,Hast thou marked{H8104}{(H8799)} the old{H5769} way{H734} which wicked{H205} men{H4962} have trodden{H1869}{(H8804)}?
Job,22,16,"Which were cut down{H7059}{(H8795)} out of time{H6256}, whose foundation{H3247} was overflown{H3332}{(H8714)} with a flood{H5104}:"
Job,22,17,"Which said{H559}{(H8802)} unto God{H410}, Depart{H5493}{(H8798)} from us: and what can the Almighty{H7706} do{H6466}{(H8799)} for them?"
Job,22,18,Yet he filled{H4390}{(H8765)} their houses{H1004} with good{H2896} things: but the counsel{H6098} of the wicked{H7563} is far{H7368}{(H8804)} from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous{H6662} see{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and are glad{H8055}{(H8799)}: and the innocent{H5355} laugh them to scorn{H3932}{(H8799)}."
Job,22,20,"Whereas{H518} our substance{H7009} is not cut down{H3582}{(H8738)}, but the remnant{H3499} of them the fire{H784} consumeth{H398}{(H8804)}."
Job,22,21,"Acquaint{H5532}{(H8685)} now thyself with him, and be at peace{H7999}{(H8798)}: thereby good{H2896} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee."
Job,22,22,"Receive{H3947}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, the law{H8451} from his mouth{H6310}, and lay up{H7760}{(H8798)} his words{H561} in thine heart{H3824}."
Job,22,23,"If thou return{H7725}{(H8799)} to the Almighty{H7706}, thou shalt be built up{H1129}{(H8735)}, thou shalt put away{H7368} iniquity{H5766} far{H7368}{(H8686)} from thy tabernacles{H168}."
Job,22,24,"Then shalt thou lay up{H7896}{(H8800)} gold{H1220} as{H5921} dust{H6083}, and the gold of Ophir{H211} as the stones{H6697} of the brooks{H5158}."

Job,22,30,He shall deliver{H4422}{(H8762)} the island{H336} of the innocent{H5355}: and it is delivered{H4422}{(H8738)} by the pureness{H1252} of thine hands{H3709}.
Job,23,1,"Then Job{H347} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,23,2,Even to day{H3117} is my complaint{H7879} bitter{H4805}: my stroke{H3027} is heavier{H3513}{(H8804)} than my groaning{H585}.
Job,23,3,Oh that{H5414}{(H8799)} I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} where I might find{H4672}{(H8799)} him! that I might come{H935}{(H8799)} even to his seat{H8499}!
Job,23,4,"I would order{H6186}{(H8799)} my cause{H4941} before{H6440} him, and fill{H4390}{(H8762)} my mouth{H6310} with arguments{H8433}."
Job,23,5,"I would know{H3045}{(H8799)} the words{H4405} which he would answer{H6030}{(H8799)} me, and understand{H995}{(H8799)} what he would say{H559}{(H8799)} unto me."
Job,23,6,Will he plead{H7378}{(H8799)} against{H5978} me with his great{H7230} power{H3581}? No; but he would put{H7760}{(H8799)} strength in me.
Job,23,7,There the righteous{H3477} might dispute{H3198}{(H8737)} with him; so should I be delivered{H6403}{(H8762)} for ever{H5331} from my judge{H8199}{(H8802)}.
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go{H1980}{(H8799)} forward{H6924}, but he is not there; and backward{H268}, but I cannot perceive{H995}{(H8799)} him:"
Job,23,9,"On the left hand{H8040}, where he doth work{H6213}{(H8800)}, but I cannot behold{H2372}{(H8799)} him: he hideth{H5848}{(H8799)} himself on the right hand{H3225}, that I cannot see{H7200}{(H8799)} him:"
Job,23,10,"But he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} the way{H1870} that I take{H5978}: when he hath tried{H974}{(H8804)} me, I shall come forth{H3318}{(H8799)} as gold{H2091}."
Job,23,11,"My foot{H7272} hath held{H270}{(H8804)} his steps{H838}, his way{H1870} have I kept{H8104}{(H8804)}, and not declined{H5186}{(H8686)}."
Job,23,12,Neither have I gone back{H4185}{(H8686)} from the commandment{H4687} of his lips{H8193}; I have esteemed{H6845}{(H8804)} the words{H561} of his mouth{H6310} more than my necessary{H2706} food.
Job,23,13,"But he is in one{H259} mind, and who can turn{H7725}{(H8686)} him? and what his soul{H5315} desireth{H183}{(H8765)}, even that he doeth{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Job,23,14,For he performeth{H7999}{(H8686)} the thing that is appointed{H2706} for me: and many{H7227} such{H2007} things are with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled{H926}{(H8735)} at his presence{H6440}: when I consider{H995}{(H8709)}, I am afraid{H6342}{(H8799)} of him."
Job,23,16,"For God{H410} maketh my heart{H3820} soft{H7401}{(H8689)}, and the Almighty{H7706} troubleth{H926}{(H8689)} me:"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off{H6789}{(H8738)} before{H6440} the darkness{H2822}, neither hath he covered{H3680}{(H8765)} the darkness{H652} from my face{H6440}."
Job,24,1,"Why, seeing times{H6256} are not hidden{H6845}{(H8738)} from the Almighty{H7706}, do they that know{H3045}{(H8802)} him not see{H2372}{(H8804)} his days{H3117}?"
Job,24,2,"Some remove{H5381}{(H8686)} the landmarks{H1367}; they violently take away{H1497}{(H8804)} flocks{H5739}, and feed{H7462}{(H8799)} thereof."
Job,24,3,"They drive away{H5090}{(H8799)} the ass{H2543} of the fatherless{H3490}, they take{H2254} the widow's{H490} ox{H7794} for a pledge{H2254}{(H8799)}."
Job,24,4,They turn{H5186}{(H8686)} the needy{H34} out of the way{H1870}: the poor{H6041}{(H8675)}{H6035} of the earth{H776} hide{H2244}{(H8795)} themselves together{H3162}.
Job,24,5,"Behold, as wild asses{H6501} in the desert{H4057}, go they forth{H3318}{(H8804)} to their work{H6467}; rising betimes{H7836}{(H8764)} for a prey{H2964}: the wilderness{H6160} yieldeth food{H3899} for them and for their children{H5288}."
Job,24,6,They reap{H7114}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H7114}{(H8686)} every one his corn{H1098} in the field{H7704}: and they gather{H3953}{(H8762)} the vintage{H3754} of the wicked{H7563}.
Job,24,7,"They cause the naked{H6174} to lodge{H3885}{(H8686)} without clothing{H3830}, that they have no covering{H3682} in the cold{H7135}."
Job,24,8,"They are wet{H7372}{(H8799)} with the showers{H2230} of the mountains{H2022}, and embrace{H2263}{(H8765)} the rock{H6697} for want of a shelter{H4268}."
Job,24,9,"They pluck{H1497}{(H8799)} the fatherless{H3490} from the breast{H7699}, and take a pledge{H2254}{(H8799)} of the poor{H6041}."
Job,24,10,"They cause him to go{H1980}{(H8765)} naked{H6174} without clothing{H3830}, and they take away{H5375}{(H8804)} the sheaf{H6016} from the hungry{H7457};"
Job,24,11,"Which make oil{H6671}{(H8686)} within{H996} their walls{H7791}, and tread{H1869}{(H8804)} their winepresses{H3342}, and suffer thirst{H6770}{(H8799)}."
Job,24,12,"Men{H4962} groan{H5008}{(H8799)} from out of the city{H5892}, and the soul{H5315} of the wounded{H2491} crieth out{H7768}{(H8762)}: yet God{H433} layeth{H7760}{(H8799)} not folly{H8604} to them."
Job,24,13,"They are of those that rebel{H4775}{(H8802)} against the light{H216}; they know{H5234}{(H8689)} not the ways{H1870} thereof, nor abide{H3427}{(H8804)} in the paths{H5410} thereof."
Job,24,14,"The murderer{H7523}{(H8802)} rising{H6965}{(H8799)} with the light{H216} killeth{H6991}{(H8799)} the poor{H6041} and needy{H34}, and in the night{H3915} is as a thief{H1590}."

Job,24,17,"For the morning{H1242} is to them even as{H3162} the shadow of death{H6757}: if one know{H5234}{(H8686)} them, they are in the terrors{H1091} of the shadow of death{H6757}."
Job,24,18,He is swift{H7031} as the waters{H6440}{H4325}; their portion{H2513} is cursed{H7043}{(H8792)} in the earth{H776}: he beholdeth{H6437}{(H8799)} not the way{H1870} of the vineyards{H3754}.
Job,24,19,Drought{H6723} and heat{H2527} consume{H1497}{(H8799)} the snow{H7950} waters{H4325}: so doth the grave{H7585} those which have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}.
Job,24,20,The womb{H7358} shall forget{H7911}{(H8799)} him; the worm{H7415} shall feed sweetly{H4988}{(H8804)} on him; he shall be no more remembered{H2142}{(H8735)}; and wickedness{H5766} shall be broken{H7665}{(H8735)} as a tree{H6086}.
Job,24,21,He evil entreateth{H7462}{(H8802)} the barren{H6135} that beareth{H3205}{(H8799)} not: and doeth not good{H3190}{(H8686)} to the widow{H490}.
Job,24,22,"He draweth{H4900}{(H8804)} also the mighty{H47} with his power{H3581}: he riseth up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and no man is sure{H539}{(H8686)} of life{H2416}."
Job,24,23,"Though it be given{H5414}{(H8799)} him to be in safety{H983}, whereon he resteth{H8172}{(H8735)}; yet his eyes{H5869} are upon their ways{H1870}."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted{H7426}{(H8804)} for a little while{H4592}, but are gone and brought low{H4355}{(H8717)}; they are taken out{H7092}{(H8735)} of the way{H1870} as all other, and cut off{H5243}{(H8799)} as the tops{H7218} of the ears of corn{H7641}."

Job,27,14,"If his children{H1121} be multiplied{H7235}{(H8799)}, it is for{H3926} the sword{H2719}: and his offspring{H6631} shall not be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)} with bread{H3899}."
Job,27,15,Those that remain{H8300} of him shall be buried{H6912}{(H8735)} in death{H4194}: and his widows{H490} shall not weep{H1058}{(H8799)}.

Job,27,17,"He may prepare{H3559}{(H8686)} it, but the just{H6662} shall put it on{H3847}{(H8799)}, and the innocent{H5355} shall divide{H2505}{(H8799)} the silver{H3701}."
Job,27,18,"He buildeth{H1129}{(H8804)} his house{H1004} as a moth{H6211}, and as a booth{H5521} that the keeper{H5341}{(H8802)} maketh{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Job,27,19,"The rich{H6223} man shall lie down{H7901}{(H8799)}, but he shall not be gathered{H622}{(H8735)}: he openeth{H6491}{(H8804)} his eyes{H5869}, and he is not."
Job,27,20,"Terrors{H1091} take hold{H5381}{(H8686)} on him as waters{H4325}, a tempest{H5492} stealeth him away{H1589}{(H8804)} in the night{H3915}."
Job,27,21,"The east{H6921} wind carrieth him away{H5375}{(H8799)}, and he departeth{H3212}{(H8799)}: and as a storm hurleth{H8175}{(H8762)} him out of his place{H4725}."
Job,27,22,"For God shall cast{H7993}{(H8686)} upon him, and not spare{H2550}{(H8799)}: he would fain{H1272}{(H8800)} flee{H1272}{(H8799)} out of his hand{H3027}."
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap{H5606}{(H8799)} their hands{H3709} at him, and shall hiss{H8319}{(H8799)} him out of his place{H4725}."

Job,28,4,"The flood{H5158} breaketh out{H6555}{(H8804)} from the inhabitant{H1481}{(H8802)}; even the waters forgotten{H7911}{(H8737)} of the foot{H7272}: they are dried up{H1809}{(H8804)}, they are gone away{H5128}{(H8804)} from men{H582}."
Job,28,5,"As for the earth{H776}, out of it cometh{H3318}{(H8799)} bread{H3899}: and under it is turned up{H2015}{(H8738)} as it were fire{H784}."

Job,28,9,He putteth forth{H7971}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} upon the rock{H2496}; he overturneth{H2015}{(H8804)} the mountains{H2022} by the roots{H8328}.
Job,28,10,He cutteth out{H1234}{(H8765)} rivers{H2975} among the rocks{H6697}; and his eye{H5869} seeth{H7200}{(H8804)} every precious thing{H3366}.
Job,28,11,He bindeth{H2280}{(H8765)} the floods{H5104} from overflowing{H1065}; and the thing that is hid{H8587} bringeth he forth{H3318}{(H8686)} to light{H216}.
Job,28,12,But where{H370} shall wisdom{H2451} be found{H4672}{(H8735)}? and where is the place{H4725} of understanding{H998}?

Job,28,17,The gold{H2091} and the crystal{H2137} cannot equal{H6186}{(H8799)} it: and the exchange{H8545} of it shall not be for jewels{H3627} of fine gold{H6337}.
Job,28,18,"No mention{H2142}{(H8735)} shall be made of coral{H7215}, or of pearls{H1378}: for the price{H4901} of wisdom{H2451} is above rubies{H6443}."

Job,29,12,"Because I delivered{H4422}{(H8762)} the poor{H6041} that cried{H7768}{(H8764)}, and the fatherless{H3490}, and him that had none to help{H5826}{(H8802)} him."
Job,29,13,The blessing{H1293} of him that was ready to perish{H6}{(H8802)} came{H935}{(H8799)} upon me: and I caused the widow's{H490} heart{H3820} to sing for joy{H7442}{(H8686)}.
Job,29,14,"I put{H3847}{(H8804)} on righteousness{H6664}, and it clothed{H3847}{(H8799)} me: my judgment{H4941} was as a robe{H4598} and a diadem{H6797}."

Job,29,22,After{H310} my words{H1697} they spake not again{H8138}{(H8799)}; and my speech{H4405} dropped{H5197}{(H8799)} upon them.
Job,29,23,And they waited{H3176}{(H8765)} for me as for the rain{H4306}; and they opened{H6473}{(H8804)} their mouth{H6310} wide as for the latter rain{H4456}.
Job,29,24,"If I laughed{H7832}{(H8799)} on them, they believed{H539}{(H8686)} it not; and the light{H216} of my countenance{H6440} they cast not down{H5307}{(H8686)}."
Job,29,25,"I chose{H977}{(H8799)} out their way{H1870}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} chief{H7218}, and dwelt{H7931}{(H8799)} as a king{H4428} in the army{H1416}, as one that comforteth{H5162}{(H8762)} the mourners{H57}."
Job,30,1,"But now they that are younger{H6810}{H3117} than I have me in derision{H7832}{(H8804)}, whose fathers{H1} I would have disdained{H3988}{(H8804)} to have set{H7896}{(H8800)} with the dogs{H3611} of my flock{H6629}."
Job,30,2,"Yea, whereto{H4100} might the strength{H3581} of their hands{H3027} profit me, in whom old age{H3624} was perished{H6}{(H8804)}?"
Job,30,3,For want{H2639} and famine{H3720} they were solitary{H1565}; fleeing{H6207}{(H8802)} into the wilderness{H6723} in former time{H570} desolate{H7722} and waste{H4875}.
Job,30,4,"Who cut up{H6998}{(H8801)} mallows{H4408} by the bushes{H7880}, and juniper{H7574} roots{H8328} for their meat{H3899}."
Job,30,5,"They were driven forth{H1644}{(H8792)} from among{H1460} men,(they cried{H7321}{(H8686)} after them as after a thief{H1590};)"

Job,30,12,"Upon my right{H3225} hand rise{H6965}{(H8799)} the youth{H6526}; they push away{H7971}{(H8765)} my feet{H7272}, and they raise up{H5549}{(H8799)} against me the ways{H734} of their destruction{H343}."
Job,30,13,"They mar{H5420}{(H8804)} my path{H5410}, they set forward{H3276}{(H8686)} my calamity{H1942}{(H8675)}{H1962}, they have no helper{H5826}{(H8802)}."
Job,30,14,They came{H857}{(H8799)} upon me as a wide{H7342} breaking{H6556} in of waters: in{H8478} the desolation{H7722} they rolled{H1556}{(H8701)} themselves upon me.
Job,30,15,Terrors{H1091} are turned{H2015}{(H8717)} upon me: they pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} my soul{H5082} as the wind{H7307}: and my welfare{H3444} passeth away{H5674}{(H8804)} as a cloud{H5645}.
Job,30,16,And now my soul{H5315} is poured out{H8210}{(H8691)} upon me; the days{H3117} of affliction{H6040} have taken hold{H270}{(H8799)} upon me.
Job,30,17,My bones{H6106} are pierced{H5365}{(H8765)} in me in the night season{H3915}: and my sinews{H6207}{(H8802)} take no rest{H7901}{(H8799)}.
Job,30,18,By the great{H7230} force{H3581} of my disease is my garment{H3830} changed{H2664}{(H8691)}: it bindeth me about{H247}{(H8799)} as the collar{H6310} of my coat{H3801}.
Job,30,19,"He hath cast{H3384}{(H8689)} me into the mire{H2563}, and I am become like{H4911}{(H8691)} dust{H6083} and ashes{H665}."

Job,30,21,Thou art become{H2015}{(H8735)} cruel{H393} to me: with thy strong{H6108} hand{H3027} thou opposest{H7852}{(H8799)} thyself against me.
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up{H5375}{(H8799)} to the wind{H7307}; thou causest me to ride{H7392}{(H8686)} upon it, and dissolvest{H4127}{(H8787)} my substance{H8454}{(H8675)}{H7738}{(H8762)}."

Job,30,25,Did not I weep{H1058}{(H8804)} for him that was in trouble{H7186}{H3117}? was not my soul{H5315} grieved{H5701}{(H8804)} for the poor{H34}?
Job,30,26,"When I looked{H6960}{(H8765)} for good{H2896}, then evil{H7451} came{H935}{(H8799)} unto me: and when I waited{H3176}{(H8762)} for light{H216}, there came{H935}{(H8799)} darkness{H652}."
Job,30,27,"My bowels{H4578} boiled{H7570}{(H8795)}, and rested{H1826}{(H8804)} not: the days{H3117} of affliction{H6040} prevented{H6923}{(H8765)} me."
Job,30,28,"I went{H1980}{(H8765)} mourning{H6937}{(H8802)} without the sun{H2535}: I stood up{H6965}{(H8804)}, and I cried{H7768}{(H8762)} in the congregation{H6951}."

Job,31,1,I made{H3772}{(H8804)} a covenant{H1285} with mine eyes{H5869}; why then should I think{H995}{(H8709)} upon a maid{H1330}?
Job,31,2,For what portion{H2506} of God{H433} is there from above{H4605}? and what inheritance{H5159} of the Almighty{H7706} from on high{H4791}?
Job,31,3,Is not destruction{H343} to the wicked{H5767}? and a strange{H5235} punishment to the workers{H6466}{(H8802)} of iniquity{H205}?
Job,31,4,"Doth not he see{H7200}{(H8799)} my ways{H1870}, and count{H5608}{(H8799)} all my steps{H6806}?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked{H1980}{(H8804)} with vanity{H7723}, or if my foot{H7272} hath hasted{H2363}{(H8799)} to deceit{H4820};"
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed{H8254}{(H8799)} in an even{H6664} balance{H3976}, that God{H433} may know{H3045}{(H8799)} mine integrity{H8538}."
Job,31,7,"If my step{H838} hath turned out{H5186}{(H8799)} of the way{H1870}, and mine heart{H3820} walked{H1980}{(H8804)} after{H310} mine eyes{H5869}, and if any blot{H3971} hath cleaved{H1692}{(H8804)} to mine hands{H3709};"
Job,31,8,"Then let me sow{H2232}{(H8799)}, and let another{H312} eat{H398}{(H8799)}; yea, let my offspring{H6631} be rooted out{H8327}{(H8792)}."
Job,31,9,"If mine heart{H3820} have been deceived{H6601}{(H8738)} by a woman{H802}, or if I have laid wait{H693}{(H8804)} at my neighbour's{H7453} door{H6607};"
Job,31,10,"Then let my wife{H802} grind{H2912}{(H8799)} unto another{H312}, and let others{H312} bow down{H3766}{(H8799)} upon her."
Job,31,11,"For this is an heinous crime{H2154}; yea, it is an iniquity{H5771} to be punished by the judges{H6414}."
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire{H784} that consumeth{H398}{(H8799)} to destruction{H11}, and would root out{H8327}{(H8762)} all mine increase{H8393}."
Job,31,13,"If I did despise{H3988}{(H8799)} the cause{H4941} of my manservant{H5650} or of my maidservant{H519}, when they contended{H7379} with me;"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} when God{H410} riseth up{H6965}{(H8799)}? and when he visiteth{H6485}{(H8799)}, what shall I answer{H7725}{(H8686)} him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made{H6213}{(H8802)} me in the womb{H990} make{H6213}{(H8804)} him? and did not one{H259} fashion{H3559}{(H8787)} us in the womb{H7358}?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld{H4513}{(H8799)} the poor{H1800} from their desire{H2656}, or have caused the eyes{H5869} of the widow{H490} to fail{H3615}{(H8762)};"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten{H398}{(H8799)} my morsel{H6595} myself alone, and the fatherless{H3490} hath not eaten{H398}{(H8804)} thereof;"
Job,31,18,"(For from my youth{H5271} he was brought up{H1431}{(H8804)} with me, as with a father{H1}, and I have guided{H5148}{(H8686)} her from my mother's{H517} womb{H990};)"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen{H7200}{(H8799)} any perish{H6}{(H8802)} for want of clothing{H3830}, or any poor{H34} without covering{H3682};"
Job,31,20,"If his loins{H2504} have not blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} me, and if he were not warmed{H2552}{(H8691)} with the fleece{H1488} of my sheep{H3532};"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up{H5130}{(H8689)} my hand{H3027} against the fatherless{H3490}, when I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} my help{H5833} in the gate{H8179}:"
Job,31,22,"Then let mine arm{H3802} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} from my shoulder blade{H7929}, and mine arm{H248} be broken{H7665}{(H8735)} from the bone{H7070}."
Job,31,23,"For destruction{H343} from God{H410} was a terror{H6343} to me, and by reason of his highness{H7613} I could{H3201}{(H8799)} not endure."
Job,31,24,"If I have made{H7760}{(H8804)} gold{H2091} my hope{H3689}, or have said{H559}{(H8804)} to the fine gold{H3800}, Thou art my confidence{H4009};"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} because my wealth{H2428} was great{H7227}, and because mine hand{H3027} had gotten{H4672}{(H8804)} much{H3524};"
Job,31,26,"If I beheld{H7200}{(H8799)} the sun{H216} when it shined{H1984}{(H8686)}, or the moon{H3394} walking{H1980}{(H8802)} in brightness{H3368};"
Job,31,27,"And my heart{H3820} hath been secretly{H5643} enticed{H6601}{(H8799)}, or my mouth{H6310} hath kissed{H5401}{(H8799)} my hand{H3027}:"
Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity{H5771} to be punished by the judge{H6416}: for I should have denied{H3584}{(H8765)} the God{H410} that is above{H4605}.
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} at the destruction{H6365} of him that hated{H8130}{(H8764)} me, or lifted up{H5782}{(H8712)} myself when evil{H7451} found{H4672}{(H8804)} him:"
Job,31,30,Neither have I suffered{H5414}{(H8804)} my mouth{H2441} to sin{H2398}{(H8800)} by wishing{H7592}{(H8800)} a curse{H423} to his soul{H5315}.
Job,31,31,"If the men{H4962} of my tabernacle{H168} said{H559}{(H8804)} not, Oh that we had{H5414}{(H8799)} of his flesh{H1320}! we cannot be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)}."
Job,31,32,The stranger{H1616} did not lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} in the street{H2351}: but I opened{H6605}{(H8799)} my doors{H1817} to the traveller{H734}.
Job,31,33,"If I covered{H3680}{(H8765)} my transgressions{H6588} as Adam{H121}, by hiding{H2934}{(H8800)} mine iniquity{H5771} in my bosom{H2243}:"
Job,31,34,"Did I fear{H6206}{(H8799)} a great{H7227} multitude{H1995}, or did the contempt{H937} of families{H4940} terrify{H2865}{(H8686)} me, that I kept silence{H1826}{(H8799)}, and went not out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the door{H6607}?"
Job,31,35,"Oh that{H5414}{(H8799)} one would hear{H8085}{(H8802)} me! behold, my desire{H8420} is, that the Almighty{H7706} would answer{H6030}{(H8799)} me, and that mine adversary{H376}{H7379} had written{H3789}{(H8804)} a book{H5612}."
Job,31,36,"Surely I would take{H5375}{(H8799)} it upon my shoulder{H7926}, and bind{H6029}{(H8799)} it as a crown{H5850} to me."
Job,31,37,I would declare{H5046}{(H8686)} unto him the number{H4557} of my steps{H6806}; as a prince{H5057} would I go near{H7126}{(H8762)} unto him.
Job,31,38,"If my land{H127} cry{H2199}{(H8799)} against me, or that the furrows{H8525} likewise{H3162} thereof complain{H1058}{(H8799)};"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten{H398}{(H8804)} the fruits{H3581} thereof without money{H3701}, or have caused the owners{H1167} thereof to lose{H5301}{(H8689)} their life{H5315}:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles{H2336} grow{H3318}{(H8799)} instead of wheat{H2406}, and cockle{H890} instead of barley{H8184}. The words{H1697} of Job{H347} are ended{H8552}{(H8804)}."
Job,32,1,"So these three{H7969} men{H582} ceased{H7673}{(H8799)} to answer{H6030}{(H8800)} Job{H347}, because he was righteous{H6662} in his own eyes{H5869}."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)} the wrath{H639} of Elihu{H453} the son{H1121} of Barachel{H1292} the Buzite{H940}, of the kindred{H4940} of Ram{H7410}: against Job{H347} was his wrath{H639} kindled{H2734}{(H8804)}, because he justified{H6663}{(H8763)} himself{H5315} rather than God{H430}."
Job,32,3,"Also against his three{H7969} friends{H7453} was his wrath{H639} kindled{H2734}{(H8804)}, because they had found{H4672}{(H8804)} no answer{H4617}, and yet had condemned{H7561}{(H8686)} Job{H347}."
Job,32,4,"Now Elihu{H453} had waited{H2442}{(H8765)} till Job{H347} had spoken{H1697}, because they were elder{H2205}{H3117} than he."
Job,32,5,"When Elihu{H453} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that there was no answer{H4617} in the mouth{H6310} of these three{H7969} men{H582}, then his wrath{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8799)}."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu{H453} the son{H1121} of Barachel{H1292} the Buzite{H940} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I am young{H6810}{H3117}, and ye are very old{H3453}; wherefore I was afraid{H2119}{(H8804)}, and durst{H3372}{(H8799)} not shew{H2331}{(H8763)} you mine opinion{H1843}."
Job,32,7,"I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Days{H3117} should speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, and multitude{H7230} of years{H8141} should teach{H3045}{(H8686)} wisdom{H2451}."
Job,32,8,But{H403} there is a spirit{H7307} in man{H582}: and the inspiration{H5397} of the Almighty{H7706} giveth them understanding{H995}{(H8799)}.
Job,32,9,Great men{H7227} are not always wise{H2449}{(H8799)}: neither do the aged{H2205} understand{H995}{(H8799)} judgment{H4941}.
Job,32,10,"Therefore I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} to me; I also will shew{H2331}{(H8762)} mine opinion{H1843}."
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited{H3176}{(H8689)} for your words{H1697}; I gave ear{H238}{(H8686)} to your reasons{H8394}, whilst ye searched out{H2713}{(H8799)} what to say{H4405}."
Job,32,12,"Yea, I attended{H995}{(H8709)} unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced{H3198}{(H8688)} Job{H347}, or that answered{H6030}{(H8802)} his words{H561}:"
Job,32,13,"Lest ye should say{H559}{(H8799)}, We have found out{H4672}{(H8804)} wisdom{H2451}: God{H410} thrusteth him down{H5086}{(H8799)}, not man{H376}."
Job,32,14,Now he hath not directed{H6186}{(H8804)} his words{H4405} against me: neither will I answer{H7725}{(H8686)} him with your speeches{H561}.
Job,32,15,"They were amazed{H2865}{(H8804)}, they answered{H6030}{(H8804)} no more: they left off{H6275}{(H8689)} speaking{H4405}."
Job,32,16,"When I had waited{H3176}{(H8689)},(for they spake{H1696}{(H8762)} not, but stood still{H5975}{(H8804)}, and answered{H6030}{(H8804)} no more;)"
Job,32,17,"I said, I will answer{H6030}{(H8799)} also my part{H2506}, I also will shew{H2331}{(H8762)} mine opinion{H1843}."
Job,32,18,"For I am full{H4390}{(H8804)} of matter{H4405}, the spirit{H7307} within{H990} me constraineth{H6693}{(H8689)} me."
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly{H990} is as wine{H3196} which hath no vent{H6605}{(H8735)}; it is ready to burst{H1234}{(H8735)} like new{H2319} bottles{H178}."
Job,32,20,"I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, that I may be refreshed{H7304}{(H8799)}: I will open{H6605}{(H8799)} my lips{H8193} and answer{H6030}{(H8799)}."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept{H5375}{(H8799)} any man's{H376} person{H6440}, neither let me give flattering titles{H3655}{(H8762)} unto man{H120}."
Job,32,22,For I know{H3045}{(H8804)} not to give flattering titles{H3655}{(H8762)}; in so doing my maker{H6213}{(H8802)} would soon{H4592} take me away{H5375}{(H8799)}.
Job,33,1,"Wherefore{H199}, Job{H347}, I pray thee, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} my speeches{H4405}, and hearken{H238}{(H8685)} to all my words{H1697}."
Job,33,2,"Behold, now I have opened{H6605}{(H8804)} my mouth{H6310}, my tongue{H3956} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} in my mouth{H2441}."
Job,33,3,My words{H561} shall be of the uprightness{H3476} of my heart{H3820}: and my lips{H8193} shall utter{H4448}{(H8765)} knowledge{H1847} clearly{H1305}{(H8803)}.
Job,33,4,"The Spirit{H7307} of God{H410} hath made{H6213}{(H8804)} me, and the breath{H5397} of the Almighty{H7706} hath given me life{H2421}{(H8762)}."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst{H3201}{(H8799)} answer{H7725}{(H8687)} me, set thy words in order{H6186}{(H8798)} before{H6440} me, stand up{H3320}{(H8690)}."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am according to thy wish{H6310} in God's{H410} stead: I also am formed{H7169}{(H8795)} out of the clay{H2563}."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror{H367} shall not make thee afraid{H1204}{(H8762)}, neither shall my hand{H405} be heavy{H3513}{(H8799)} upon thee."
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken{H559}{(H8804)} in mine hearing{H241}, and I have heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of thy words{H4405}, saying,"
Job,33,9,"I am clean{H2134} without transgression{H6588}, I am innocent{H2643}; neither is there iniquity{H5771} in me."
Job,33,10,"Behold, he findeth{H4672}{(H8799)} occasions{H8569} against me, he counteth{H2803}{(H8799)} me for his enemy{H341}{(H8802)},"
Job,33,11,"He putteth{H7760}{(H8799)} my feet{H7272} in the stocks{H5465}, he marketh{H8104}{(H8799)} all my paths{H734}."
Job,33,12,"Behold, in this thou art not just{H6663}{(H8804)}: I will answer{H6030}{(H8799)} thee, that God{H433} is greater{H7235}{(H8799)} than man{H582}."
Job,33,13,Why dost thou strive{H7378}{(H8804)} against him? for he giveth not account{H6030}{(H8799)} of any of his matters{H1697}.
Job,33,14,"For God{H410} speaketh{H1696}{(H8762)} once{H259}, yea twice{H8147}, yet man perceiveth{H7789}{(H8799)} it not."
Job,33,15,"In a dream{H2472}, in a vision{H2384} of the night{H3915}, when deep{H8639} sleep falleth{H5307}{(H8800)} upon men{H582}, in slumberings{H8572} upon the bed{H4904};"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth{H1540}{(H8799)} the ears{H241} of men{H582}, and sealeth{H2856}{(H8799)} their instruction{H4561},"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw{H5493}{(H8687)} man{H120} from his purpose{H4639}, and hide{H3680}{(H8762)} pride{H1466} from man{H1397}."
Job,33,18,"He keepeth back{H2820}{(H8799)} his soul{H5315} from the pit{H7845}, and his life{H2416} from perishing{H5674}{(H8800)} by the sword{H7973}."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened{H3198}{(H8717)} also with pain{H4341} upon his bed{H4904}, and the multitude{H7230}{(H8675)}{H7379} of his bones{H6106} with strong{H386} pain:"
Job,33,20,"So that his life{H2416} abhorreth{H2092}{(H8765)} bread{H3899}, and his soul{H5315} dainty{H8378} meat{H3978}."
Job,33,21,"His flesh{H1320} is consumed away{H3615}{(H8799)}, that it cannot be seen{H7210}; and his bones{H6106} that were not seen{H7200}{(H8795)} stick out{H8192}{(H8795)}{(H8675)}{H8205}."
Job,33,22,"Yea, his soul{H5315} draweth near{H7126}{(H8799)} unto the grave{H7845}, and his life{H2416} to the destroyers{H4191}{(H8688)}."
Job,33,23,"If there{H3426} be a messenger{H4397} with him, an interpreter{H3887}{(H8688)}, one{H259} among a thousand{H505}, to shew{H5046}{(H8687)} unto man{H120} his uprightness{H3476}:"
Job,33,24,"Then he is gracious{H2603}{(H8799)} unto him, and saith{H559}{(H8799)}, Deliver{H6308}{(H8798)} him from going down{H3381}{(H8800)} to the pit{H7845}: I have found{H4672}{(H8804)} a ransom{H3724}."
Job,33,25,His flesh{H1320} shall be fresher{H7375}{(H8738)} than a child's{H5290}: he shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} to the days{H3117} of his youth{H5934}:
Job,33,26,"He shall pray{H6279}{(H8799)} unto God{H433}, and he will be favourable{H7521}{(H8799)} unto him: and he shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} his face{H6440} with joy{H8643}: for he will render{H7725}{(H8686)} unto man{H582} his righteousness{H6666}."
Job,33,27,"He looketh{H7789}{(H8799)} upon men{H582}, and if any say{H559}{(H8799)}, I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, and perverted{H5753}{(H8689)} that which was right{H3477}, and it profited{H7737}{(H8804)} me not;"
Job,33,28,"He will deliver{H6299}{(H8804)} his soul{H5315} from going{H5674}{(H8800)} into the pit{H7845}, and his life{H2416} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} the light{H216}."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these things worketh{H6466}{(H8799)} God{H410} oftentimes{H6471}{H7969} with man{H1397},"
Job,33,30,"To bring back{H7725}{(H8687)} his soul{H5315} from the pit{H7845}, to be enlightened{H215}{(H8736)} with the light{H216} of the living{H2416}."
Job,33,31,"Mark well{H7181}{(H8685)}, O Job{H347}, hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto me: hold thy peace{H2790}{(H8685)}, and I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)}."
Job,33,32,"If thou hast{H3426} any thing to say{H4405}, answer{H7725}{(H8685)} me: speak{H1696}{(H8761)}, for I desire{H2654}{(H8804)} to justify{H6663}{(H8763)} thee."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto me: hold thy peace{H2790}{(H8685)}, and I shall teach{H502}{(H8762)} thee wisdom{H2451}."
Job,34,1,"Furthermore Elihu{H453} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,34,2,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} my words{H4405}, O ye wise{H2450} men; and give ear{H238}{(H8685)} unto me, ye that have knowledge{H3045}{(H8802)}."
Job,34,3,"For the ear{H241} trieth{H974}{(H8799)} words{H4405}, as the mouth{H2441} tasteth{H2938}{(H8799)} meat{H398}{(H8800)}."
Job,34,4,Let us choose{H977}{(H8799)} to us judgment{H4941}: let us know{H3045}{(H8799)} among ourselves what is good{H2896}.
Job,34,5,"For Job{H347} hath said{H559}{(H8804)}, I am righteous{H6663}{(H8804)}: and God{H410} hath taken away{H5493}{(H8689)} my judgment{H4941}."
Job,34,6,Should I lie{H3576}{(H8762)} against my right{H4941}? my wound{H2671} is incurable{H605}{(H8803)} without transgression{H6588}.
Job,34,7,"What man{H1397} is like Job{H347}, who drinketh up{H8354}{(H8799)} scorning{H3933} like water{H4325}?"
Job,34,8,"Which goeth{H732}{(H8804)} in company{H2274} with the workers{H6466}{(H8802)} of iniquity{H205}, and walketh{H3212}{(H8800)} with wicked{H7562} men{H582}."
Job,34,9,"For he hath said{H559}{(H8804)}, It profiteth{H5532}{(H8799)} a man{H1397} nothing that he should delight{H7521}{(H8800)} himself with God{H430}."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} unto me, ye men{H582} of understanding{H3824}: far be it{H2486} from God{H410}, that he should do wickedness{H7562}; and from the Almighty{H7706}, that he should commit iniquity{H5766}."
Job,34,11,"For the work{H6467} of a man{H120} shall he render{H7999}{(H8762)} unto him, and cause every man{H376} to find{H4672}{(H8686)} according to his ways{H734}."
Job,34,12,"Yea, surely{H551} God{H410} will not do wickedly{H7561}{(H8686)}, neither will the Almighty{H7706} pervert{H5791}{(H8762)} judgment{H4941}."
Job,34,13,Who hath given him a charge{H6485}{(H8804)} over the earth{H776}? or who hath disposed{H7760}{(H8804)} the whole world{H8398}?
Job,34,14,"If he set{H7760}{(H8799)} his heart{H3820} upon man, if he gather{H622}{(H8799)} unto himself his spirit{H7307} and his breath{H5397};"
Job,34,15,"All flesh{H1320} shall perish{H1478}{(H8799)} together{H3162}, and man{H120} shall turn again{H7725}{(H8799)} unto dust{H6083}."
Job,34,16,"If now thou hast understanding{H998}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} this: hearken{H238}{(H8685)} to the voice{H6963} of my words{H4405}."
Job,34,17,Shall even he that hateth{H8130}{(H8802)} right{H4941} govern{H2280}{(H8799)}? and wilt thou condemn{H7561}{(H8686)} him that is most{H3524} just{H6662}?
Job,34,18,"Is it fit to say{H559}{(H8800)} to a king{H4428}, Thou art wicked{H1100}? and to princes{H5081}, Ye are ungodly{H7563}?"
Job,34,19,"How much less to him that accepteth{H5375}{(H8804)} not the persons{H6440} of princes{H8269}, nor regardeth{H5234}{(H8765)} the rich{H7771} more than{H6440} the poor{H1800}? for they all are the work{H4639} of his hands{H3027}."
Job,34,20,"In a moment{H7281} shall they die{H4191}{(H8799)}, and the people{H5971} shall be troubled{H1607}{(H8792)} at midnight{H2676}{H3915}, and pass away{H5674}{(H8799)}: and the mighty{H47} shall be taken away{H5493}{(H8686)} without hand{H3027}."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes{H5869} are upon the ways{H1870} of man{H376}, and he seeth{H7200}{(H8799)} all his goings{H6806}."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness{H2822}, nor shadow of death{H6757}, where the workers{H6466}{(H8802)} of iniquity{H205} may hide{H5641}{(H8736)} themselves."
Job,34,23,For he will not lay{H7760}{(H8799)} upon man{H376} more than right; that he should enter{H1980}{(H8800)} into judgment{H4941} with God{H410}.
Job,34,24,"He shall break in pieces{H7489}{(H8799)} mighty men{H3524} without number{H2714}, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} others{H312} in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore he knoweth{H5234}{(H8686)} their works{H4566}, and he overturneth{H2015}{(H8804)} them in the night{H3915}, so that they are destroyed{H1792}{(H8691)}."
Job,34,26,He striketh{H5606}{(H8804)} them as{H8478} wicked men{H7563} in the open{H4725} sight{H7200}{(H8802)} of others;
Job,34,27,"Because they turned back{H5493}{(H8804)} from him{H310}, and would not consider{H7919}{(H8689)} any of his ways{H1870}:"
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry{H6818} of the poor{H1800} to come{H935}{(H8687)} unto him, and he heareth{H8085}{(H8799)} the cry{H6818} of the afflicted{H6041}."
Job,34,29,"When he giveth quietness{H8252}{(H8686)}, who then can make trouble{H7561}{(H8686)}? and when he hideth{H5641}{(H8686)} his face{H6440}, who then can behold{H7789}{(H8799)} him? whether it be done against a nation{H1471}, or against a man{H120} only{H3162}:"
Job,34,30,"That the hypocrite{H120}{H2611} reign{H4427}{(H8800)} not, lest the people{H5971} be ensnared{H4170}."
Job,34,31,"Surely it is meet to be said{H559}{(H8736)} unto God{H410}, I have borne{H5375}{(H8804)} chastisement, I will not offend{H2254}{(H8799)} any more:"
Job,34,32,"That which I see{H2372}{(H8799)} not{H1107} teach{H3384}{(H8685)} thou me: if I have done{H6466}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}, I will do{H3254}{(H8686)} no more."
Job,34,33,"Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense{H7999}{(H8762)} it, whether thou refuse{H3588}{H3988}{(H8804)}, or whether thou choose{H977}{(H8799)}; and not I: therefore speak{H1696}{(H8761)} what thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)}."
Job,34,34,"Let men{H582} of understanding{H3824} tell{H559}{(H8799)} me, and let a wise{H2450} man{H1397} hearken{H8085}{(H8802)} unto me."
Job,34,35,"Job{H347} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8762)} without knowledge{H1847}, and his words{H1697} were without wisdom{H7919}{(H8687)}."
Job,34,36,My desire{H15}{(H8676)}{H1} is that Job{H347} may be tried{H974}{(H8735)} unto the end{H5331} because of his answers{H8666} for wicked{H205} men{H582}.
Job,34,37,"For he addeth{H3254}{(H8686)} rebellion{H6588} unto his sin{H2403}, he clappeth{H5606}{(H8799)} his hands among us, and multiplieth{H7235}{(H8686)} his words{H561} against God{H410}."
Job,35,1,"Elihu{H453} spake{H6030}{(H8799)} moreover, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,35,2,"Thinkest{H2803}{(H8804)} thou this to be right{H4941}, that thou saidst{H559}{(H8804)}, My righteousness{H6664} is more than God's{H410}?"
Job,35,3,"For thou saidst{H559}{(H8799)}, What advantage{H5532}{(H8799)} will it be unto thee? and, What profit{H3276}{(H8686)} shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin{H2403}?"
Job,35,4,"I will answer{H7725}{(H8686)}{H4405} thee, and thy companions{H7453} with thee."
Job,35,5,"Look{H5027}{(H8685)} unto the heavens{H8064}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)}; and behold{H7789}{(H8798)} the clouds{H7834} which are higher{H1361}{(H8804)} than thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou sinnest{H2398}{(H8804)}, what doest{H6466}{(H8799)} thou against him? or if thy transgressions{H6588} be multiplied{H7231}{(H8804)}, what doest{H6213}{(H8799)} thou unto him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous{H6663}{(H8804)}, what givest{H5414}{(H8799)} thou him? or what receiveth{H3947}{(H8799)} he of thine hand{H3027}?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness{H7562} may hurt a man{H376} as thou art; and thy righteousness{H6666} may profit the son{H1121} of man{H120}.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude{H7230} of oppressions{H6217} they make the oppressed to cry{H2199}{(H8686)}: they cry out{H7768}{(H8762)} by reason of the arm{H2220} of the mighty{H7227}.
Job,35,10,"But none saith{H559}{(H8804)}, Where is God{H433} my maker{H6213}{(H8802)}, who giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} songs{H2158} in the night{H3915};"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth{H502}{(H8764)} us more than the beasts{H929} of the earth{H776}, and maketh us wiser{H2449}{(H8762)} than the fowls{H5775} of heaven{H8064}?"
Job,35,12,"There they cry{H6817}{(H8799)}, but none giveth answer{H6030}{(H8799)}, because{H6440} of the pride{H1347} of evil men{H7451}."
Job,35,13,"Surely God{H410} will not hear{H8085}{(H8799)} vanity{H7723}, neither will the Almighty{H7706} regard{H7789}{(H8799)} it."
Job,35,14,"Although{H637} thou sayest{H559}{(H8799)} thou shalt not see{H7789}{(H8799)} him, yet judgment{H1779} is before{H6440} him; therefore trust{H2342}{(H8787)} thou in him."
Job,35,15,"But now, because it is not so, he hath visited{H6485}{(H8804)} in his anger{H639}; yet he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} it not in great{H3966} extremity{H6580}:"
Job,35,16,Therefore doth Job{H347} open{H6475}{(H8799)} his mouth{H6310} in vain{H1892}; he multiplieth{H3527}{(H8686)} words{H4405} without{H1097} knowledge{H1847}.
Job,36,1,"Elihu{H453} also proceeded{H3254}{(H8686)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,36,2,"Suffer{H3803}{(H8761)} me a little{H2191}, and I will shew{H2331}{(H8762)} thee that I have yet to speak{H4405} on God's{H433} behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will fetch{H5375}{(H8799)} my knowledge{H1843} from afar{H7350}, and will ascribe{H5414}{(H8799)} righteousness{H6664} to my Maker{H6466}{(H8802)}."
Job,36,4,For truly{H551} my words{H4405} shall not be false{H8267}: he that is perfect{H8549} in knowledge{H1844} is with thee.
Job,36,5,"Behold, God{H410} is mighty{H3524}, and despiseth{H3988}{(H8799)} not any: he is mighty{H3524} in strength{H3581} and wisdom{H3820}."
Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life{H2421}{(H8762)} of the wicked{H7563}: but giveth{H5414}{(H8799)} right{H4941} to the poor{H6041}.
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth{H1639}{(H8799)} not his eyes{H5869} from the righteous{H6662}: but with kings{H4428} are they on the throne{H3678}; yea, he doth establish{H3427}{(H8686)} them for ever{H5331}, and they are exalted{H1361}{(H8799)}."
Job,36,8,"And if they be bound{H631}{(H8803)} in fetters{H2131}, and be holden{H3920}{(H8735)} in cords{H2256} of affliction{H6040};"
Job,36,9,"Then he sheweth{H5046}{(H8686)} them their work{H6467}, and their transgressions{H6588} that they have exceeded{H1396}{(H8691)}."
Job,36,10,"He openeth{H1540}{(H8799)} also their ear{H241} to discipline{H4148}, and commandeth{H559}{(H8799)} that they return{H7725}{(H8799)} from iniquity{H205}."
Job,36,11,"If they obey{H8085}{(H8799)} and serve{H5647}{(H8799)} him, they shall spend{H3615}{(H8762)} their days{H3117} in prosperity{H2896}, and their years{H8141} in pleasures{H5273}."
Job,36,12,"But if they obey{H8085}{(H8799)} not, they shall perish{H5674}{(H8799)} by the sword{H7973}, and they shall die{H1478}{(H8799)} without knowledge{H1847}."
Job,36,13,But the hypocrites{H2611} in heart{H3820} heap up{H7760}{(H8799)} wrath{H639}: they cry{H7768}{(H8762)} not when he bindeth{H631}{(H8804)} them.
Job,36,14,"They{H5315} die{H4191}{(H8799)} in youth{H5290}, and their life{H2416} is among the unclean{H6945}."
Job,36,15,"He delivereth{H2502}{(H8762)} the poor{H6041} in his affliction{H6040}, and openeth{H1540}{(H8799)} their ears{H241} in oppression{H3906}."
Job,36,16,"Even so would he have removed{H5496}{(H8689)} thee out of the strait{H6310}{H6862} into a broad place{H7338}, where{H8478} there is no straitness{H4164}; and that which should be set{H5183} on thy table{H7979} should be full{H4390}{(H8804)} of fatness{H1880}."
Job,36,17,But thou hast fulfilled{H4390}{(H8804)} the judgment{H1779} of the wicked{H7563}: judgment{H1779} and justice{H4941} take hold{H8551}{(H8799)} on thee.
Job,36,18,"Because there is wrath{H2534}, beware lest he take thee away{H5496}{(H8686)} with his stroke{H5607}: then a great{H7230} ransom{H3724} cannot deliver{H5186}{(H8686)} thee."
Job,36,19,"Will he esteem{H6186}{(H8799)} thy riches{H7769}? no, not gold{H1222}, nor all the forces{H3981} of strength{H3581}."
Job,36,20,"Desire{H7602}{(H8799)} not the night{H3915}, when people{H5971} are cut off{H5927}{(H8800)} in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed{H8104}{(H8734)}, regard{H6437}{(H8799)} not iniquity{H205}: for this hast thou chosen{H977}{(H8804)} rather than affliction{H6040}."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God{H410} exalteth{H7682}{(H8686)} by his power{H3581}: who teacheth{H3384}{(H8688)} like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath enjoined{H6485}{(H8804)} him his way{H1870}? or who can say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thou hast wrought{H6466}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}?"
Job,36,24,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} that thou magnify{H7679}{(H8686)} his work{H6467}, which men{H582} behold{H7891}{(H8790)}."
Job,36,25,Every man{H120} may see{H2372}{(H8804)} it; man{H582} may behold{H5027}{(H8686)} it afar off{H7350}.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God{H410} is great{H7689}, and we know{H3045}{(H8799)} him not, neither can the number{H4557} of his years{H8141} be searched out{H2714}."
Job,36,27,For he maketh small{H1639}{(H8762)} the drops{H5198} of water{H4325}: they pour down{H2212}{(H8799)} rain{H4306} according to the vapour{H108} thereof:
Job,36,28,Which the clouds{H7834} do drop{H5140}{(H8799)} and distil{H7491}{(H8799)} upon man{H120} abundantly{H7227}.
Job,36,29,"Also can any understand{H995}{(H8799)} the spreadings{H4666} of the clouds{H5645}, or the noise{H8663} of his tabernacle{H5521}?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he spreadeth{H6566}{(H8804)} his light{H216} upon it, and covereth{H3680}{(H8765)} the bottom{H8328} of the sea{H3220}."
Job,36,31,For by them judgeth{H1777}{(H8799)} he the people{H5971}; he giveth{H5414}{(H8799)} meat{H400} in abundance{H4342}{(H8688)}.
Job,36,32,With clouds{H3709} he covereth{H3680}{(H8765)} the light{H216}; and commandeth{H6680}{(H8762)} it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt{H6293}{(H8688)}.
Job,36,33,"The noise{H7452} thereof sheweth{H5046}{(H8686)} concerning it, the cattle{H4735} also concerning the vapour{H5927}{(H8802)}."
Job,37,1,"At this{H2063} also my heart{H3820} trembleth{H2729}{(H8799)}, and is moved out{H5425}{(H8799)} of his place{H4725}."
Job,37,2,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} attentively{H8085}{(H8800)} the noise{H7267} of his voice{H6963}, and the sound{H1899} that goeth out{H3318}{(H8799)} of his mouth{H6310}."
Job,37,3,"He directeth{H3474}{(H8765)} it{H8281}{(H8799)} under the whole heaven{H8064}, and his lightning{H216} unto the ends{H3671} of the earth{H776}."
Job,37,4,After{H310} it a voice{H6963} roareth{H7580}{(H8799)}: he thundereth{H7481}{(H8686)} with the voice{H6963} of his excellency{H1347}; and he will not stay{H6117}{(H8762)} them when his voice{H6963} is heard{H8085}{(H8735)}.
Job,37,5,"God{H410} thundereth{H7481}{(H8686)} marvellously{H6381}{(H8737)} with his voice{H6963}; great things{H1419} doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} he, which we cannot comprehend{H3045}{(H8799)}."
Job,37,6,"For he saith{H559}{(H8799)} to the snow{H7950}, Be thou{H1933}{(H8798)} on the earth{H776}; likewise to the small{H4306} rain{H1653}, and to the great{H4306} rain{H1653} of his strength{H5797}."
Job,37,7,He sealeth up{H2856}{(H8799)} the hand{H3027} of every man{H120}; that all men{H582} may know{H3045}{(H8800)} his work{H4639}.
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts{H2416} go{H935}{(H8799)} into{H1119} dens{H695}, and remain{H7931}{(H8799)} in their places{H4585}."
Job,37,9,Out of the south{H2315} cometh{H935}{(H8799)} the whirlwind{H5492}: and cold{H7135} out of the north{H4215}.
Job,37,10,By the breath{H5397} of God{H410} frost{H7140} is given{H5414}{(H8799)}: and the breadth{H7341} of the waters{H4325} is straitened{H4164}.
Job,37,11,Also by watering{H7377} he wearieth{H2959}{(H8686)} the thick cloud{H5645}: he scattereth{H6327}{(H8686)} his bright{H216} cloud{H6051}:
Job,37,12,And it is turned{H2015}{(H8693)} round about{H4524} by his counsels{H8458}: that they may do{H6467} whatsoever he commandeth{H6680}{(H8762)} them upon the face{H6440} of the world{H8398} in the earth{H776}.
Job,37,13,"He causeth it to come{H4672}{(H8686)}, whether for correction{H7626}, or for his land{H776}, or for mercy{H2617}."
Job,37,14,"Hearken{H238}{(H8685)} unto this, O Job{H347}: stand still{H5975}{(H8798)}, and consider{H995}{(H8708)} the wondrous{H6381}{(H8737)} works of God{H410}."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know{H3045}{(H8799)} when God{H433} disposed{H7760}{(H8800)} them, and caused the light{H216} of his cloud{H6051} to shine{H3313}{(H8689)}?"
Job,37,16,"Dost thou know{H3045}{(H8799)} the balancings{H4657} of the clouds{H5645}, the wondrous works{H4652} of him which is perfect{H8549} in knowledge{H1843}?"
Job,37,17,"How thy garments{H899} are warm{H2525}, when he quieteth{H8252}{(H8687)} the earth{H776} by the south{H1864} wind?"
Job,37,18,"Hast thou with him spread out{H7554}{(H8686)} the sky{H7834}, which is strong{H2389}, and as a molten{H3332}{(H8716)} looking glass{H7209}?"

Job,41,2,Canst thou put{H7760}{(H8799)} an hook{H100} into his nose{H639}? or bore{H5344}{(H8799)} his jaw{H3895} through with a thorn{H2336}?
Job,41,3,Will he make many{H7235}{(H8686)} supplications{H8469} unto thee? will he speak{H1696}{(H8762)} soft{H7390} words unto thee?
Job,41,4,Will he make{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with thee? wilt thou take{H3947}{(H8799)} him for a servant{H5650} for ever{H5769}?
Job,41,5,Wilt thou play{H7832}{(H8762)} with him as with a bird{H6833}? or wilt thou bind{H7194}{(H8799)} him for thy maidens{H5291}?
Job,41,6,Shall the companions{H2271} make a banquet{H3739}{(H8799)} of him? shall they part{H2673}{(H8799)} him among the merchants{H3669}?
Job,41,7,Canst thou fill{H4390}{(H8762)} his skin{H5785} with barbed irons{H7905}? or his head{H7218} with fish{H1709} spears{H6767}?
Job,41,8,"Lay{H7760}{(H8798)} thine hand{H3709} upon him, remember{H2142}{(H8798)} the battle{H4421}, do no more{H3254}{(H8686)}."
Job,41,9,"Behold, the hope{H8431} of him is in vain{H3576}{(H8738)}: shall not one be cast down{H2904}{(H8714)} even at the sight{H4758} of him?"
Job,41,10,None is so fierce{H393} that dare stir him up{H5782}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H5782}{(H8686)}: who then is able to stand{H3320}{(H8691)} before{H6440} me?
Job,41,11,"Who hath prevented{H6923}{(H8689)} me, that I should repay{H7999}{(H8762)} him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven{H8064} is mine."
Job,41,12,"I will not conceal{H2790}{(H8686)} his parts{H907}, nor his power{H1369}{H1697}, nor his comely{H2433} proportion{H6187}."
Job,41,13,Who can discover{H1540}{(H8765)} the face{H6440} of his garment{H3830}? or who can come{H935}{(H8799)} to him with his double{H3718} bridle{H7448}?
Job,41,14,Who can open{H6605}{(H8765)} the doors{H1817} of his face{H6440}? his teeth{H8127} are terrible{H367} round about{H5439}.
Job,41,15,"His scales{H4043}{H650} are his pride{H1346}, shut up together{H5462}{(H8803)} as with a close{H6862} seal{H2368}."
Job,41,16,"One{H259} is so near{H5066}{(H8799)} to another{H259}, that no air{H7307} can come{H935}{(H8799)} between them."
Job,41,17,"They are joined{H1692}{(H8792)} one{H376} to another{H251}, they stick together{H3920}{(H8691)}, that they cannot be sundered{H6504}{(H8691)}."
Job,41,18,"By his neesings{H5846} a light{H216} doth shine{H1984}{(H8686)}, and his eyes{H5869} are like the eyelids{H6079} of the morning{H7837}."
Job,41,19,"Out of his mouth{H6310} go{H1980}{(H8799)} burning lamps{H3940}, and sparks{H3590} of fire{H784} leap out{H4422}{(H8691)}."
Job,41,20,"Out of his nostrils{H5156} goeth{H3318}{(H8799)} smoke{H6227}, as out of a seething{H5301}{(H8803)} pot{H1731} or caldron{H100}."
Job,41,21,"His breath{H5315} kindleth{H3857}{(H8762)} coals{H1513}, and a flame{H3851} goeth out{H3318}{(H8799)} of his mouth{H6310}."
Job,41,22,"In his neck{H6677} remaineth{H3885}{(H8799)} strength{H5797}, and sorrow{H1670} is turned into joy{H1750}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him."
Job,41,23,The flakes{H4651} of his flesh{H1320} are joined together{H1692}{(H8804)}: they are firm{H3332}{(H8803)} in themselves; they cannot be moved{H4131}{(H8735)}.
Job,41,24,"His heart{H3820} is as firm{H3332}{(H8803)} as a stone{H68}; yea, as hard{H3332}{(H8803)} as a piece{H6400} of the nether{H8482} millstone."
Job,41,25,"When he raiseth up{H7613} himself, the mighty{H352} are afraid{H1481}{(H8799)}: by reason of breakings{H7667} they purify{H2398}{(H8691)} themselves."
Job,41,26,"The sword{H2719} of him that layeth{H5381}{(H8688)} at him cannot hold{H6965}{(H8799)}: the spear{H2595}, the dart{H4551}, nor the habergeon{H8302}."
Job,41,27,"He esteemeth{H2803}{(H8799)} iron{H1270} as straw{H8401}, and brass{H5154} as rotten{H7539} wood{H6086}."
Job,41,28,The arrow{H1121}{H7198} cannot make him flee{H1272}{(H8686)}: slingstones{H68}{H7050} are turned{H2015}{(H8738)} with him into stubble{H7179}.
Job,41,29,Darts{H8455} are counted{H2803}{(H8738)} as stubble{H7179}: he laugheth{H7832}{(H8799)} at the shaking{H7494} of a spear{H3591}.
Job,41,30,Sharp{H2303} stones{H2789} are under him: he spreadeth{H7502}{(H8799)} sharp pointed things{H2742} upon the mire{H2916}.
Job,41,31,He maketh the deep{H4688} to boil{H7570}{(H8686)} like a pot{H5518}: he maketh{H7760}{(H8799)} the sea{H3220} like a pot of ointment{H4841}.
Job,41,32,He maketh a path{H5410} to shine{H215}{(H8686)} after{H310} him; one would think{H2803}{(H8799)} the deep{H8415} to be hoary{H7872}.
Job,41,33,"Upon earth{H6083} there is not his like{H4915}, who is made{H6213}{(H8803)} without{H1097} fear{H2844}."
Job,41,34,He beholdeth{H7200}{(H8799)} all high{H1364} things: he is a king{H4428} over all the children{H1121} of pride{H7830}.
Job,42,1,"Then Job{H347} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)},"
Job,42,2,"I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou canst do{H3201}{(H8799)} every thing, and that no thought{H4209} can be withholden{H1219}{(H8735)} from thee."
Job,42,3,"Who is he that hideth{H5956}{(H8688)} counsel{H6098} without knowledge{H1847}? therefore have I uttered{H5046}{(H8689)} that I understood{H995}{(H8799)} not; things too wonderful{H6381}{(H8737)} for me, which I knew{H3045}{(H8799)} not."
Job,42,4,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, I beseech thee, and I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)}: I will demand{H7592}{(H8799)} of thee, and declare{H3045}{(H8685)} thou unto me."
Job,42,5,I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} of thee by the hearing{H8088} of the ear{H241}: but now mine eye{H5869} seeth{H7200}{(H8804)} thee.
Job,42,6,"Wherefore I abhor{H3988}{(H8799)} myself, and repent{H5162}{(H8738)} in dust{H6083} and ashes{H665}."
Job,42,7,"And it was so, that after{H310} the LORD{H3068} had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} these words{H1697} unto Job{H347}, the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Eliphaz{H464} the Temanite{H8489}, My wrath{H639} is kindled{H2734}{(H8804)} against thee, and against thy two{H8147} friends{H7453}: for ye have not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} of me the thing that is right{H3559}{(H8737)}, as my servant{H5650} Job{H347} hath."
Job,42,8,"Therefore take{H3947}{(H8798)} unto you now seven{H7651} bullocks{H6499} and seven{H7651} rams{H352}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} to my servant{H5650} Job{H347}, and offer up{H5927}{(H8689)} for yourselves a burnt offering{H5930}; and my servant{H5650} Job{H347} shall pray{H6419}{(H8691)} for you: for him{H6440} will I accept{H5375}{(H8799)}: lest I deal{H6213}{(H8800)} with you after your folly{H5039}, in that ye have not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} of me the thing which is right{H3559}{(H8737)}, like my servant{H5650} Job{H347}."
Job,42,9,"So Eliphaz{H464} the Temanite{H8489} and Bildad{H1085} the Shuhite{H7747} and Zophar{H6691} the Naamathite{H5284} went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} according as the LORD{H3068} commanded{H1696}{(H8765)} them: the LORD{H3068} also accepted{H5375}{(H8799)} Job{H6440}{H347}."
Job,42,10,"And the LORD{H3068} turned{H7725}{(H8804)} the captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622} of Job{H347}, when he prayed{H6419}{(H8692)} for his friends{H7453}: also the LORD{H3068} gave{H3254}{(H8686)} Job{H347} twice as much{H4932} as he had before."
Job,42,11,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} there unto him all his brethren{H251}, and all his sisters{H269}, and all they that had been of his acquaintance{H3045}{(H8802)} before{H6440}, and did eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} with him in his house{H1004}: and they bemoaned{H5110}{(H8799)} him, and comforted{H5162}{(H8762)} him over all the evil{H7451} that the LORD{H3068} had brought{H935}{(H8689)} upon him: every man{H376} also gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him a{H259} piece of money{H7192}, and every one{H376} an earring{H5141} of gold{H2091}."
Job,42,12,"So the LORD{H3068} blessed{H1288}{(H8765)} the latter end{H319} of Job{H347} more than his beginning{H7225}: for he had fourteen{H702}{H6240} thousand{H505} sheep{H6629}, and six{H8337} thousand{H505} camels{H1581}, and a thousand{H505} yoke{H6776} of oxen{H1241}, and a thousand{H505} she asses{H860}."
Job,42,13,He had also seven{H7658} sons{H1121} and three{H7969} daughters{H1323}.
Job,42,14,"And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of the first{H259}, Jemima{H3224}; and the name{H8034} of the second{H8145}, Kezia{H7103}; and the name{H8034} of the third{H7992}, Kerenhappuch{H7163}."
Job,42,15,And in all the land{H776} were no women{H802} found{H4672}{(H8738)} so fair{H3303} as the daughters{H1323} of Job{H347}: and their father{H1} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them inheritance{H5159} among{H8432} their brethren{H251}.
Job,42,16,"After{H310} this lived{H2421}{(H8799)} Job{H347} an hundred{H3967} and forty{H705} years{H8141}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} his sons{H1121}, and his sons{H1121}' sons{H1121}, even four{H702} generations{H1755}."
Job,42,17,"So Job{H347} died{H4191}{(H8799)}, being old{H2205} and full{H7649} of days{H3117}."
Psalm,1,1,"Blessed{H835} is the man{H376} that walketh{H1980}{(H8804)} not in the counsel{H6098} of the ungodly{H7563}, nor standeth{H5975}{(H8804)} in the way{H1870} of sinners{H2400}, nor sitteth{H3427}{(H8804)} in the seat{H4186} of the scornful{H3887}{(H8801)}."
Psalm,1,2,But his delight{H2656} is in the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068}; and in his law{H8451} doth he meditate{H1897}{(H8799)} day{H3119} and night{H3915}.
Psalm,1,3,"And he shall be like a tree{H6086} planted{H8362}{(H8803)} by the rivers{H6388} of water{H4325}, that bringeth forth{H5414}{(H8799)} his fruit{H6529} in his season{H6256}; his leaf{H5929} also shall not wither{H5034}{(H8799)}; and whatsoever he doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} shall prosper{H6743}{(H8686)}."
Psalm,1,4,The ungodly{H7563} are not so: but are like the chaff{H4671} which the wind{H7307} driveth away{H5086}{(H8799)}.
Psalm,1,5,"Therefore the ungodly{H7563} shall not stand{H6965}{(H8799)} in the judgment{H4941}, nor sinners{H2400} in the congregation{H5712} of the righteous{H6662}."
Psalm,1,6,For the LORD{H3068} knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} the way{H1870} of the righteous{H6662}: but the way{H1870} of the ungodly{H7563} shall perish{H6}{(H8799)}.
Psalm,2,1,"Why do the heathen{H1471} rage{H7283}{(H8804)}, and the people{H3816} imagine{H1897}{(H8799)} a vain thing{H7385}?"
Psalm,2,2,"The kings{H4428} of the earth{H776} set{H3320}{(H8691)} themselves, and the rulers{H7336}{(H8802)} take counsel{H3245}{(H8738)} together{H3162}, against the LORD{H3068}, and against his anointed{H4899}, saying,"
Psalm,2,3,"Let us break{H5423} their bands{H4147} asunder{H5423}{(H8762)}, and cast away{H7993}{(H8686)} their cords{H5688} from us."
Psalm,2,4,He that sitteth{H3427}{(H8802)} in the heavens{H8064} shall laugh{H7832}{(H8799)}: the Lord{H136} shall have them in derision{H3932}{(H8799)}.

Psalm,2,9,Thou shalt break{H7489}{(H8799)} them with a rod{H7626} of iron{H1270}; thou shalt dash them in pieces{H5310}{(H8762)} like a potter's{H3335}{(H8802)} vessel{H3627}.
