Leviticus,10,19,"And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?"
Leviticus,10,20,"And when Moses heard that, he was content."
Leviticus,11,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,"
Leviticus,11,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth."
Leviticus,11,3,"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat."
Leviticus,11,4,"Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,5,"And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,6,"And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,7,"And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,8,"Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,9,"These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat."
Leviticus,11,10,"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:"
Leviticus,11,11,"They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination."
Leviticus,11,12,"Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you."
Leviticus,11,13,"And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,"
Leviticus,11,14,"And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;"
Leviticus,11,15,Every raven after his kind;
Leviticus,11,16,"And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,"
Leviticus,11,17,"And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,"
Leviticus,11,18,"And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,"
Leviticus,11,19,"And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,"All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you."
Leviticus,11,21,"Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;"
Leviticus,11,22,"Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind."
Leviticus,11,23,"But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you."
Leviticus,11,24,And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus,11,25,"And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,26,"The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,27,"And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,28,"And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,29,"These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,"
Leviticus,11,30,"And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole."
Leviticus,11,31,"These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,32,"And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed."
Leviticus,11,33,"And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it."
Leviticus,11,34,"Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,36,"Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,39,"And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,40,"And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,41,And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,"Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination."
Leviticus,11,43,"Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby."
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
Leviticus,11,45,"For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy."
Leviticus,11,46,"This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:"
Leviticus,11,47,"To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten."
Leviticus,12,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,12,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean."
Leviticus,12,3,And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,"And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled."
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:"
Leviticus,12,7,"Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female."
Leviticus,12,8,"And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean."
Leviticus,13,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,13,2,"When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:"
Leviticus,13,3,"And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:"
Leviticus,13,5,"And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:"
Leviticus,13,6,"And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again."
Leviticus,13,8,"And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy."
Leviticus,13,9,"When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;"
Leviticus,13,10,"And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;"
Leviticus,13,11,"It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;"
Leviticus,13,13,"Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy."
Leviticus,13,16,"Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;"
Leviticus,13,17,"And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean."
Leviticus,13,18,"The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,"
Leviticus,13,19,"And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;"
Leviticus,13,20,"And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:"
Leviticus,13,22,"And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;"
Leviticus,13,25,"Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:"
Leviticus,13,27,"And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,28,"And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning."
Leviticus,13,29,If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
Leviticus,13,30,"Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard."
Leviticus,13,31,"And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:"
Leviticus,13,32,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;"
Leviticus,13,33,"He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:"
Leviticus,13,34,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
Leviticus,13,36,"Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;"
Leviticus,13,39,"Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,40,"And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean."
Leviticus,13,41,"And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;"
Leviticus,13,44,"He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head."
Leviticus,13,45,"And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean."
Leviticus,13,46,All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.
Leviticus,13,47,"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;"
Leviticus,13,48,"Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;"
Leviticus,13,49,"And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:"
Leviticus,13,50,"And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:"
Leviticus,13,51,"And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire."
Leviticus,13,53,"And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;"
Leviticus,13,54,"Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:"
Leviticus,13,55,"And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without."
Leviticus,13,56,"And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:"
Leviticus,13,57,"And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire."
Leviticus,13,58,"And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean."
Leviticus,13,59,"This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean."
Leviticus,14,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,14,2,This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus,14,3,"And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;"
Leviticus,14,4,"Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:"
Leviticus,14,5,And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus,14,6,"As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:"
Leviticus,14,7,"And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field."
Leviticus,14,8,"And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil."
Leviticus,14,11,"And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:"
Leviticus,14,12,"And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:"
Leviticus,14,13,"And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:"
Leviticus,14,14,"And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:"
Leviticus,14,15,"And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:"
Leviticus,14,16,"And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:"
Leviticus,14,17,"And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:"
Leviticus,14,18,And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,19,"And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:"
Leviticus,14,20,"And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;"
Leviticus,14,22,"And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,24,"And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:"
Leviticus,14,25,"And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:"
Leviticus,14,26,And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:
Leviticus,14,27,And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:
Leviticus,14,28,"And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:"
Leviticus,14,29,"And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,30,"And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;"
Leviticus,14,31,"Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,32,"This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing."
Leviticus,14,33,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,14,34,"When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;"
Leviticus,14,35,"And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:"
Leviticus,14,36,"Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:"
Leviticus,14,37,"And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;"
Leviticus,14,38,"Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:"
Leviticus,14,39,"And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;"
Leviticus,14,40,"Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:"
Leviticus,14,41,"And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:"
Leviticus,14,42,"And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house."
Leviticus,14,43,"And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;"
Leviticus,14,44,"Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus,14,47,And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus,14,48,"And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed."
Leviticus,14,49,"And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:"
Leviticus,14,50,And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus,14,51,"And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:"
Leviticus,14,52,"And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:"
Leviticus,14,53,"But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,54,"This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,"
Leviticus,14,55,"And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,"
Leviticus,14,56,"And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:"
Leviticus,14,57,"To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy."
Leviticus,15,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,15,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness."
Leviticus,15,4,"Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,6,"And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,7,"And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,8,"And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."

Leviticus,17,4,"And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:"

Leviticus,17,11,For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

Leviticus,17,15,"And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean."

Leviticus,21,15,Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.
Leviticus,21,16,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,21,17,"Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God."
Leviticus,21,18,"For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,"
Leviticus,21,19,"Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,"
Leviticus,21,20,"Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;"
Leviticus,21,21,No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus,21,22,"He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy."
Leviticus,21,23,"Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
Leviticus,21,24,"And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel."
Leviticus,22,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,2,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,3,"Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,4,"What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;"
Leviticus,22,5,"Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;"
Leviticus,22,6,"The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water."
Leviticus,22,7,"And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food."
Leviticus,22,8,"That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,9,"They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them."
Leviticus,22,10,"There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing."
Leviticus,22,11,"But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat."
Leviticus,22,12,"If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things."
Leviticus,22,13,"But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof."
Leviticus,22,14,"And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing."
Leviticus,22,15,"And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;"
Leviticus,22,16,"Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
Leviticus,22,17,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,18,"Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;"
Leviticus,22,19,"Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats."
Leviticus,22,20,"But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you."
Leviticus,22,21,"And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein."
Leviticus,22,22,"Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD."
Leviticus,22,23,"Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted."
Leviticus,22,24,"Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land."
Leviticus,22,25,"Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you."
Leviticus,22,26,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,27,"When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD."
Leviticus,22,28,"And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day."
Leviticus,22,29,"And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will."
Leviticus,22,30,On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.
Leviticus,22,31,"Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,32,"Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,"
Leviticus,22,33,"That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,23,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts."
Leviticus,23,3,"Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings."
Leviticus,23,4,"These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons."
Leviticus,23,5,In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover.
Leviticus,23,6,And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus,23,7,In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
Leviticus,23,8,But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
Leviticus,23,9,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:"
Leviticus,23,11,"And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it."
Leviticus,23,12,And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
Leviticus,23,13,"And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin."
Leviticus,23,14,"And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings."
Leviticus,23,15,"And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:"
Leviticus,23,16,Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
Leviticus,23,17,Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.
Leviticus,23,18,"And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD."
Leviticus,23,19,"Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings."
Leviticus,23,20,"And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest."
Leviticus,23,21,"And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations."
Leviticus,23,22,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,23,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,24,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation."
Leviticus,23,25,Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Leviticus,23,26,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,27,"Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD."
Leviticus,23,28,"And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,29,"For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people."
Leviticus,23,30,"And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people."
Leviticus,23,31,Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus,23,32,"It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath."
Leviticus,23,33,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,34,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD."
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
Leviticus,23,36,Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.
Leviticus,23,37,"These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:"
Leviticus,23,38,"Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD."
Leviticus,23,39,"Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath."
Leviticus,23,40,"And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
Leviticus,23,43,"That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,44,And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
Leviticus,24,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,2,"Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually."
Leviticus,24,3,"Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations."
Leviticus,24,4,He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
Leviticus,24,5,"And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake."
Leviticus,24,6,"And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD."
Leviticus,24,7,"And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD."
Leviticus,24,8,"Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant."
Leviticus,24,9,And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
Leviticus,24,10,"And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;"
Leviticus,24,11,"And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)"
Leviticus,24,12,"And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them."
Leviticus,24,13,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,14,"Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
Leviticus,24,19,"And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;"
Leviticus,24,20,"Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again."
Leviticus,24,21,"And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,"Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,24,23,"And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,"
Leviticus,25,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD."
Leviticus,25,3,"Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;"
Leviticus,25,4,"But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee."
Leviticus,25,7,"And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat."
Leviticus,25,8,"And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,"Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land."
Leviticus,25,10,"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family."
Leviticus,25,11,"A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed."
Leviticus,25,12,For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus,25,14,"And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:"
Leviticus,25,15,"According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:"
Leviticus,25,16,"According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee."
Leviticus,25,17,Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,25,18,"Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety."
Leviticus,25,19,"And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety."
Leviticus,25,20,"And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:"
Leviticus,25,21,"Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years."
Leviticus,25,22,"And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store."
Leviticus,25,23,"The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me."
Leviticus,25,24,And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus,25,25,"If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;"
Leviticus,25,27,"Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession."
Leviticus,25,29,"And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it."
Leviticus,25,30,"And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile."
Leviticus,25,31,"But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile."
Leviticus,25,32,"Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time."
Leviticus,25,33,"And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus,25,35,"And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee."
Leviticus,25,36,"Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee."
Leviticus,25,37,"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:"
Leviticus,25,40,"But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile."
Leviticus,25,41,"And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return."
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen."
Leviticus,25,43,Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
Leviticus,25,44,"Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids."
Leviticus,25,45,"Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession."
Leviticus,25,46,"And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour."
Leviticus,25,47,"And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:"
Leviticus,25,48,After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
Leviticus,25,49,"Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,"And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him."
Leviticus,25,51,"If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for."
Leviticus,25,52,"And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption."
Leviticus,25,53,And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,26,2,"Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,26,3,"If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;"
Leviticus,26,4,"Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely."
Leviticus,26,6,"And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,8,"And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,"And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new."
Leviticus,26,11,And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus,26,12,"And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright."
Leviticus,26,14,"But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;"
Leviticus,26,15,"And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:"
Leviticus,26,16,"I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it."
Leviticus,26,17,"And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you."
Leviticus,26,18,"And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,"And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:"
Leviticus,26,20,"And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits."
Leviticus,26,21,"And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate."
Leviticus,26,23,"And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;"
Leviticus,26,24,"Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy."
Leviticus,26,26,"And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;"
Leviticus,26,28,"Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,"And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat."
Leviticus,26,30,"And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours."
Leviticus,26,32,And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus,26,33,"And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste."
Leviticus,26,34,"Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths."
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it."
Leviticus,26,36,"And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth."
Leviticus,26,37,"And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up."
Leviticus,26,39,And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
Leviticus,26,40,"If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;"
Leviticus,26,41,"And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:"
Leviticus,26,42,"Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD."
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses."
Leviticus,27,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,27,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation."
Leviticus,27,3,"And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,"And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,6,"And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him."
Leviticus,27,9,"And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:"
Leviticus,27,12,"And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation."
Leviticus,27,14,"And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation."
Leviticus,27,19,"And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him."
Leviticus,27,20,"And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more."
Leviticus,27,21,"But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's."
Leviticus,27,22,"And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;"
Leviticus,27,23,"Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong."
Leviticus,27,25,And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Leviticus,27,26,"Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's."
Leviticus,27,27,"And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation."
Leviticus,27,28,"Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD."
Leviticus,27,29,"None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,27,30,"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD."
Leviticus,27,31,"And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof."
Leviticus,27,32,"And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD."
Leviticus,27,33,"He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."
Leviticus,27,34,"These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai."
Numbers,1,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"

Numbers,1,49,"Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:"
Numbers,1,50,"But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle."

Numbers,3,13,"Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD."
Numbers,3,14,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,"

Numbers,6,6,All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.
Numbers,6,7,"He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head."
Numbers,6,8,All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.
Numbers,6,9,"And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it."

Numbers,6,12,"And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled."
Numbers,6,13,"And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:"
Numbers,6,14,"And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,"
Numbers,6,15,"And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings."
Numbers,6,16,"And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:"
Numbers,6,17,"And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,"And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings."
Numbers,6,19,"And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:"
Numbers,6,20,"And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine."
Numbers,6,21,"This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."

Numbers,8,21,"And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them."
Numbers,8,22,"And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them."
Numbers,8,23,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,24,This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
Numbers,8,25,"And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:"
Numbers,8,26,"But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge."
Numbers,9,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
Numbers,9,2,Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.
Numbers,9,3,"In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it."
Numbers,9,4,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover."
Numbers,9,5,"And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel."
Numbers,9,6,"And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:"
Numbers,9,7,"And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?"
Numbers,9,8,"And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you."
Numbers,9,9,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,9,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD."
Numbers,9,11,"The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Numbers,9,12,"They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it."
Numbers,9,13,"But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin."
Numbers,9,14,"And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land."
Numbers,9,15,"And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning."
Numbers,9,16,"So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night."
Numbers,9,17,"And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents."
Numbers,9,18,"At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents."
Numbers,9,19,"And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not."
Numbers,9,20,"And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed."
Numbers,9,21,"And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed."
Numbers,9,22,"Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed."
Numbers,9,23,"At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,10,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,10,2,"Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps."
Numbers,10,3,"And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Numbers,10,4,"And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee."
Numbers,10,5,"When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward."
Numbers,10,6,"When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys."
Numbers,10,7,"But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm."
Numbers,10,8,"And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations."
Numbers,10,9,"And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God."
Numbers,10,11,"And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony."
Numbers,10,12,And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
Numbers,10,14,In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Numbers,10,15,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
Numbers,10,16,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers,10,17,"And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle."
Numbers,10,18,And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers,10,19,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,10,20,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
Numbers,10,21,"And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came."
Numbers,10,22,And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Numbers,10,23,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,10,24,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

Numbers,10,26,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
Numbers,10,27,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers,10,28,"Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward."
Numbers,10,29,"And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel."
Numbers,10,30,"And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred."
Numbers,10,31,"And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes."
Numbers,10,32,"And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee."
Numbers,10,33,"And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them."
Numbers,10,34,"And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp."
Numbers,10,35,"And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee."
Numbers,10,36,"And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel."
Numbers,11,1,"And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched."
Numbers,11,3,And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
Numbers,11,4,"And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:"
Numbers,11,6,"But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes."
Numbers,11,7,"And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium."
Numbers,11,8,"And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil."
Numbers,11,9,"And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it."
Numbers,11,10,"Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased."
Numbers,11,11,"And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?"
Numbers,11,13,"Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat."
Numbers,11,14,"I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me."
Numbers,11,15,"And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness."
Numbers,11,16,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee."
Numbers,11,17,"And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone."
Numbers,11,18,"And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat."
Numbers,11,19,"Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;"
Numbers,11,20,"But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?"
Numbers,11,21,"And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month."
Numbers,11,22,"Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?"
Numbers,11,23,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not."
Numbers,11,24,"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle."
Numbers,11,25,"And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease."
Numbers,11,26,"But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp."
Numbers,11,28,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them."
Numbers,11,29,"And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!"
Numbers,11,30,"And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel."
Numbers,11,31,"And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth."
Numbers,11,32,"And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague."
Numbers,11,34,And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
Numbers,11,35,And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.
Numbers,12,1,And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
Numbers,12,2,"And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it."
Numbers,12,3,"(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out."
Numbers,12,5,"And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth."
Numbers,12,6,"And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,"My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house."
Numbers,12,8,"With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
Numbers,12,9,And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers,12,10,"And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous."
Numbers,12,11,"And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned."
Numbers,12,12,"Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb."
Numbers,12,13,"And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee."
Numbers,12,14,"And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again."
Numbers,12,15,And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
Numbers,12,16,"And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,13,2,"Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them."
Numbers,13,3,And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.
Numbers,13,4,"And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur."
Numbers,13,5,"Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori."
Numbers,13,6,"Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh."
Numbers,13,7,"Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph."
Numbers,13,8,"Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun."
Numbers,13,9,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu."
Numbers,13,10,"Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi."
Numbers,13,11,"Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi."
Numbers,13,12,"Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli."
Numbers,13,13,"Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael."
Numbers,13,14,"Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi."
Numbers,13,15,"Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
Numbers,13,17,"And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:"
Numbers,13,18,"And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;"
Numbers,13,19,"And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;"
Numbers,13,20,"And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes."
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,"And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs."
Numbers,13,24,"The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence."
Numbers,13,25,And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
Numbers,13,26,"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it."
Numbers,13,28,"Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there."
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan."
Numbers,13,30,"And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it."
Numbers,13,31,"But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we."
Numbers,13,32,"And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature."
Numbers,13,33,"And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
Numbers,14,1,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?"
Numbers,14,4,"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt."
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Numbers,14,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:"
Numbers,14,7,"And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land."
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not."
Numbers,14,10,But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
Numbers,14,11,"And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they."
Numbers,14,13,"And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)"
Numbers,14,14,"And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,"
Numbers,14,16,"Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,17,"And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,"
Numbers,14,18,"The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation."
Numbers,14,19,"Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."
Numbers,14,20,"And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:"
Numbers,14,21,"But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD."
Numbers,14,22,"Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;"
Numbers,14,23,"Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:"
Numbers,14,24,"But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it."
Numbers,14,25,"(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea."
Numbers,14,26,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,14,27,"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me."
Numbers,14,28,"Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:"
Numbers,14,29,"Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me."
Numbers,14,30,"Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,14,31,"But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,"After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise."
Numbers,14,35,"I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
Numbers,14,36,"And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,"
Numbers,14,37,"Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD."
Numbers,14,38,"But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still."
Numbers,14,39,And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
Numbers,14,40,"And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned."
Numbers,14,41,"And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper."
Numbers,14,42,"Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies."
Numbers,14,43,"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you."
Numbers,14,44,"But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp."
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,"
Numbers,15,3,"And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:"
Numbers,15,4,Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.
Numbers,15,5,"And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb."
Numbers,15,6,"Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil."
Numbers,15,7,"And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Numbers,15,8,"And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:"
Numbers,15,9,Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.
Numbers,15,10,"And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Numbers,15,11,"Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid."
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number."
Numbers,15,13,"All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Numbers,15,14,"And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do."
Numbers,15,15,"One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD."
Numbers,15,16,"One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you."
Numbers,15,17,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,18,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,"
Numbers,15,19,"Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD."
Numbers,15,20,"Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it."
Numbers,15,21,Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.
Numbers,15,22,"And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,"
Numbers,15,23,"Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;"
Numbers,15,24,"Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:"
Numbers,15,26,"And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance."
Numbers,15,27,"And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,28,"And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him."
Numbers,15,29,"Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them."
Numbers,15,30,"But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people."
Numbers,15,31,"Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him."
Numbers,15,32,"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,"And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation."
Numbers,15,34,"And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him."
Numbers,15,35,"And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp."
Numbers,15,36,"And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,15,37,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,38,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:"
Numbers,15,39,"And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:"
Numbers,15,40,"That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God."
Numbers,15,41,"I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God."
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:"
Numbers,16,2,"And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:"
Numbers,16,3,"And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?"
Numbers,16,4,"And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:"
Numbers,16,5,"And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him."
Numbers,16,6,"This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;"
Numbers,16,7,"And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi."
Numbers,16,8,"And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:"
Numbers,16,9,"Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?"
Numbers,16,10,"And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?"
Numbers,16,11,"For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?"
Numbers,16,12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:"
Numbers,16,13,"Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?"
Numbers,16,14,"Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up."
Numbers,16,15,"And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them."
Numbers,16,16,"And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:"
Numbers,16,17,"And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer."
Numbers,16,18,"And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,16,19,And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,16,21,"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."
Numbers,16,22,"And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?"
Numbers,16,23,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,24,"Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
Numbers,16,25,And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers,16,26,"And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins."
Numbers,16,27,"So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children."
Numbers,16,28,"And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind."
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD."
Numbers,16,31,"And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:"
Numbers,16,32,"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods."
Numbers,16,33,"They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation."
Numbers,16,34,"And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also."
Numbers,16,35,"And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense."
Numbers,16,36,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,37,"Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed."
Numbers,16,38,"The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel."
Numbers,16,39,"And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:"
Numbers,16,40,"To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,16,41,"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD."
Numbers,16,42,"And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared."
Numbers,16,43,And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
Numbers,16,44,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,45,"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces."
Numbers,16,46,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun."
Numbers,16,47,"And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
Numbers,16,49,"Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah."
Numbers,16,50,And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
Numbers,17,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,17,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod."
Numbers,17,3,And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
Numbers,17,4,"And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you."
Numbers,17,5,"And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you."
Numbers,17,6,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods."
Numbers,17,7,And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
Numbers,17,8,"And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod."
Numbers,17,10,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not."
Numbers,17,11,"And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he."
Numbers,17,12,"And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish."
Numbers,17,13,Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?
Numbers,18,1,"And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,"And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness."
Numbers,18,3,"And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die."
Numbers,18,4,"And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you."
Numbers,18,5,"And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel."
Numbers,18,6,"And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Numbers,18,7,"Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death."
Numbers,18,8,"And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever."
Numbers,18,9,"This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons."
Numbers,18,10,In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.
Numbers,18,11,"And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it."
Numbers,18,12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee."
Numbers,18,13,"And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it."
Numbers,18,14,Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
Numbers,18,15,"Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem."
Numbers,18,16,"And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Numbers,18,18,"And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine."
Numbers,18,19,"All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee."
Numbers,18,20,"And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel."
Numbers,18,21,"And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Numbers,18,22,"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die."
Numbers,18,23,"But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance."
Numbers,18,24,"But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
Numbers,18,25,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,18,26,"Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe."
Numbers,18,27,"And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress."
Numbers,18,28,"Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest."
Numbers,18,29,"Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it."
Numbers,18,30,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress."
Numbers,18,31,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation."
Numbers,18,32,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die."
Numbers,19,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,19,2,"This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:"
Numbers,19,3,"And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:"
Numbers,19,4,"And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:"
Numbers,19,5,"And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:"
Numbers,19,6,"And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer."
Numbers,19,7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even."
Numbers,19,8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even."
Numbers,19,9,"And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin."
Numbers,19,10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever."
Numbers,19,11,He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him."
Numbers,19,14,"This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean."
Numbers,19,16,"And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:"
Numbers,19,18,"And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:"
Numbers,19,19,"And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even."
Numbers,19,20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even."
Numbers,19,22,And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
Numbers,20,1,"Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers,20,3,"And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!"
Numbers,20,4,"And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?"
Numbers,20,5,"And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."
Numbers,20,6,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them."
Numbers,20,7,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,20,8,"Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink."
Numbers,20,9,"And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him."
Numbers,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"
Numbers,20,11,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also."
Numbers,20,12,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them."
Numbers,20,13,"This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them."
Numbers,20,14,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:"
Numbers,20,15,"How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:"
Numbers,20,16,"And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:"
Numbers,20,17,"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders."
Numbers,20,18,"And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword."
Numbers,20,19,"And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet."
Numbers,20,20,"And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand."
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
Numbers,20,22,"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,"
Numbers,20,24,"Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:"
Numbers,20,26,"And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there."
Numbers,20,27,And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers,20,28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount."
Numbers,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel."
Numbers,21,1,"And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners."
Numbers,21,2,"And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
Numbers,21,3,"And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah."
Numbers,21,4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way."
Numbers,21,5,"And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread."
Numbers,21,6,"And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died."
Numbers,21,7,"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live."
Numbers,21,9,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived."
Numbers,21,10,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth."
Numbers,21,11,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising."
Numbers,21,12,"From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared."
Numbers,21,13,"From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,"And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab."
Numbers,21,16,"And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:"
Numbers,21,18,"The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:"
Numbers,21,19,And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
Numbers,21,20,"And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon."
Numbers,21,21,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
Numbers,21,22,"Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders."
Numbers,21,23,"And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
Numbers,21,24,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong."
Numbers,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:"
Numbers,21,28,"For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites."
Numbers,21,30,"We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba."
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there."
Numbers,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and og the king of bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon."
Numbers,21,35,"So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land."
Numbers,22,1,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho."
Numbers,22,2,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel."
Numbers,22,4,"And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:"
Numbers,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed."
Numbers,22,7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak."
Numbers,22,8,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?"
Numbers,22,10,"And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,"
Numbers,22,11,"Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out."
Numbers,22,12,"And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed."
Numbers,22,13,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you."
Numbers,22,14,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us."
Numbers,22,15,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they."
Numbers,22,16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:"
Numbers,22,17,"For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people."
Numbers,22,18,"And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more."
Numbers,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more."
Numbers,22,20,"And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do."
Numbers,22,21,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab."
Numbers,22,22,"And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way."
Numbers,22,24,"But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side."
Numbers,22,25,"And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again."
Numbers,22,26,"And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left."
Numbers,22,27,"And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff."
Numbers,22,28,"And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?"
Numbers,22,29,"And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee."
Numbers,22,30,"And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay."
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face."
Numbers,22,32,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:"
Numbers,22,33,"And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive."
Numbers,22,34,"And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again."
Numbers,22,35,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak."
Numbers,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast."
Numbers,22,37,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?"
Numbers,22,38,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak."
Numbers,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth."
Numbers,22,40,"And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams."
Numbers,23,2,And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
Numbers,23,3,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place."
Numbers,23,4,"And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram."
Numbers,23,5,"And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak."
Numbers,23,6,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab."
Numbers,23,7,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel."
Numbers,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?"
Numbers,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations."
Numbers,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!"
Numbers,23,11,"And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether."
Numbers,23,12,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?"
Numbers,23,13,"And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence."
Numbers,23,14,"And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar."
Numbers,23,15,"And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder."
Numbers,23,16,"And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus."
Numbers,23,17,"And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?"
Numbers,23,18,"And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:"
Numbers,23,19,"God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"
Numbers,23,20,"Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it."
Numbers,23,21,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them."
Numbers,23,22,God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
Numbers,23,23,"Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!"
Numbers,23,24,"Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain."
Numbers,23,25,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
Numbers,23,26,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?"
Numbers,23,27,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence."
Numbers,23,28,"And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward jeshimon."
Numbers,23,29,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams."
Numbers,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar."
Numbers,24,1,"And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him."
Numbers,24,3,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
Numbers,24,4,"He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:"
Numbers,24,5,"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!"
Numbers,24,6,"As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters."
Numbers,24,7,"He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted."
Numbers,24,8,"God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows."
Numbers,24,9,"He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee."
Numbers,24,10,"And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour."
Numbers,24,12,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,"
Numbers,24,13,"If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?"
Numbers,24,14,"And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days."
Numbers,24,15,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
Numbers,24,16,"He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:"
Numbers,24,17,"I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth."
Numbers,24,18,"And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly."
Numbers,24,19,"Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city."
Numbers,24,20,"And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever."
Numbers,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock."
Numbers,24,22,"Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive."
Numbers,24,23,"And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!"
Numbers,24,24,"And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever."
Numbers,24,25,"And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way."
Numbers,25,1,"And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab."
Numbers,25,2,"And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods."
Numbers,25,3,And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
Numbers,25,4,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel."
Numbers,25,5,"And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor."
Numbers,25,6,"And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Numbers,25,7,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;"
Numbers,25,8,"And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel."
Numbers,25,9,And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
Numbers,25,10,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,25,11,"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy."
Numbers,25,12,"Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:"
Numbers,25,13,"And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel."
Numbers,25,14,"Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites."
Numbers,25,15,"And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian."
Numbers,25,16,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,25,17,"Vex the Midianites, and smite them:"
Numbers,25,18,"For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake."
Numbers,26,1,"And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,"
Numbers,26,2,"Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel."
Numbers,26,3,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,"
Numbers,26,4,"Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt."
Numbers,26,5,"Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites:"

Numbers,26,10,"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign."

Numbers,26,54,"To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him."
Numbers,26,55,Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
Numbers,26,56,According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.

Numbers,26,63,"These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho."
Numbers,26,64,"But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai."
Numbers,26,65,"For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah."

Numbers,27,3,"Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons."
Numbers,27,4,"Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father."
Numbers,27,5,And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
Numbers,27,6,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,27,7,The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
Numbers,27,8,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter."
Numbers,27,9,"And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren."
Numbers,27,10,"And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren."

Numbers,27,15,"And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,"
Numbers,27,16,"Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,"
Numbers,27,17,"Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd."
Numbers,27,18,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;"

Numbers,27,22,"And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:"
Numbers,27,23,"And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,28,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,28,2,"Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season."
Numbers,28,3,"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering."
Numbers,28,4,"The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;"
Numbers,28,5,"And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil."
Numbers,28,6,"It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD."
Numbers,28,7,And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

Numbers,29,40,And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,30,1,"And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded."
Numbers,30,2,"If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth."
Numbers,30,3,"If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;"
Numbers,30,4,"And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand."

Numbers,30,9,"But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her."
Numbers,30,10,"And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;"
Numbers,30,11,"And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand."
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her."
Numbers,30,13,"Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void."
Numbers,30,14,"But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them."
Numbers,30,15,But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
Numbers,30,16,"These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house."
Numbers,31,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,31,2,Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
Numbers,31,3,"And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian."
Numbers,31,4,"Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war."
Numbers,31,5,"So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war."
Numbers,31,6,"And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand."
Numbers,31,7,"And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males."
Numbers,31,8,"And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,"And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods."
Numbers,31,10,"And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire."
Numbers,31,11,"And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts."
Numbers,31,12,"And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,"And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp."
Numbers,31,14,"And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle."
Numbers,31,15,"And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?"
Numbers,31,16,"Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD."
Numbers,31,17,"Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him."
Numbers,31,18,"But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves."
Numbers,31,19,"And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day."
Numbers,31,20,"And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood."
Numbers,31,21,"And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;"
Numbers,31,22,"Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,"
Numbers,31,23,"Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water."
Numbers,31,24,"And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp."
Numbers,31,25,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,31,26,"Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:"
Numbers,31,27,"And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:"
Numbers,31,28,"And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:"
Numbers,31,29,"Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD."
Numbers,31,30,"And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD."
Numbers,31,31,And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,"
Numbers,31,33,"And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,"
Numbers,31,34,"And threescore and one thousand asses,"
Numbers,31,35,"And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him."
Numbers,31,36,"And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:"
Numbers,31,37,And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
Numbers,31,38,And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was threescore and twelve.
Numbers,31,39,And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute was threescore and one.
Numbers,31,40,And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was thirty and two persons.
Numbers,31,41,"And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,"
Numbers,31,43,"(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,"
Numbers,31,44,"And thirty and six thousand beeves,"
Numbers,31,45,"And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,"
Numbers,31,46,And sixteen thousand persons;)
Numbers,31,47,"Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,48,"And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:"
Numbers,31,49,"And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us."
Numbers,31,50,"We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD."
Numbers,31,51,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels."
Numbers,31,52,"And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels."
Numbers,31,53,"(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)"
Numbers,31,54,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD."
Numbers,32,1,"Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;"
Numbers,32,2,"The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,"
Numbers,32,3,"Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,"
Numbers,32,4,"Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:"
Numbers,32,5,"Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan."
Numbers,32,6,"And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?"
Numbers,32,7,And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
Numbers,32,8,"Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land."
Numbers,32,9,"For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them."
Numbers,32,10,"And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,"
Numbers,32,11,"Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:"
Numbers,32,12,"Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD."
Numbers,32,13,"And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed."
Numbers,32,14,"And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel."
Numbers,32,15,"For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people."
Numbers,32,16,"And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:"
Numbers,32,17,"But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,"We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance."
Numbers,32,19,"For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward."
Numbers,32,20,"And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,"
Numbers,32,21,"And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,"
Numbers,32,22,"And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD."

Numbers,32,29,"And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:"
Numbers,32,30,"But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
Numbers,32,31,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do."
Numbers,32,32,"We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's."

Numbers,33,2,And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.
Numbers,33,3,"And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians."

Numbers,33,51,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;"
Numbers,33,52,"Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:"
Numbers,33,53,"And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it."
Numbers,33,54,"And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit."
Numbers,33,55,"But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell."
Numbers,33,56,"Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them."
Numbers,34,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,34,2,"Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)"
Numbers,34,3,"Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:"
Numbers,34,4,"And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:"
Numbers,34,5,"And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea."
Numbers,34,6,"And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border."
Numbers,34,7,And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:
Numbers,34,8,From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:
Numbers,34,9,"And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border."
Numbers,34,10,And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:
Numbers,34,11,"And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:"
Numbers,34,12,"And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about."
Numbers,34,13,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:"
Numbers,34,14,"For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:"
Numbers,34,15,"The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising."
Numbers,34,16,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,34,17,"These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,34,18,"And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance."
Numbers,34,19,"And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh."
Numbers,34,20,"And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud."
Numbers,34,21,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon."
Numbers,34,22,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli."
Numbers,34,23,"The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod."
Numbers,34,24,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan."
Numbers,34,25,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach."
Numbers,34,26,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan."
Numbers,34,27,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi."
Numbers,34,28,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud."
Numbers,34,29,These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,"
Numbers,35,2,"Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them."
Numbers,35,3,"And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts."
Numbers,35,4,"And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about."
Numbers,35,5,"And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities."
Numbers,35,6,"And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities."
Numbers,35,7,So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.
Numbers,35,8,And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
Numbers,35,9,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Numbers,35,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;"
Numbers,35,11,"Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares."
Numbers,35,12,"And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment."
Numbers,35,13,And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.
Numbers,35,14,"Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge."
Numbers,35,15,"These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither."
Numbers,35,16,"And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,"The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him."
Numbers,35,20,"But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;"
Numbers,35,21,"Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him."
Numbers,35,22,"But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,"
Numbers,35,23,"Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:"
Numbers,35,24,Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
Numbers,35,25,"And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,"But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;"
Numbers,35,27,"And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:"
Numbers,35,28,Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers,35,30,"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die."
Numbers,35,31,"Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death."
Numbers,35,32,"And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest."
Numbers,35,33,"So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel."
Numbers,36,1,"And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:"
Numbers,36,2,"And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance."
Numbers,36,4,"And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
Numbers,36,5,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well."
Numbers,36,6,"This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry."
Numbers,36,7,So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers,36,8,"And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
Numbers,36,10,"Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:"
Numbers,36,11,"For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers brothers' sons:"
Numbers,36,12,"And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father."
Numbers,36,13,"These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho."
Deuteronomy,1,1,"These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
Deuteronomy,1,3,"And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;"
Deuteronomy,1,4,"After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:"
Deuteronomy,1,5,"On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:"
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them."
Deuteronomy,1,9,"And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:"
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)"
Deuteronomy,1,12,"How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?"
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you."
Deuteronomy,1,14,"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do."
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it."
Deuteronomy,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged."
Deuteronomy,1,22,"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come."
Deuteronomy,1,23,"And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:"
Deuteronomy,1,24,"And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us."
Deuteronomy,1,26,"Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:"
Deuteronomy,1,27,"And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there."
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place."
Deuteronomy,1,32,"Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers."
Deuteronomy,1,36,"Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD."
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea."
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies."
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill."
Deuteronomy,1,44,"And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah."
Deuteronomy,1,45,"And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"And the LORD spake unto me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy,2,8,"And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,10,"The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;"
Deuteronomy,2,11,"Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"That the LORD spake unto me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:"
Deuteronomy,2,19,"And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,20,(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
Deuteronomy,2,21,"A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:"
Deuteronomy,2,23,"And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee."
Deuteronomy,2,26,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us."
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land."
Deuteronomy,2,32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:"
Deuteronomy,2,35,"Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took."
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:"
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon."
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves."
Deuteronomy,3,8,"And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;"
Deuteronomy,3,9,(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
Deuteronomy,3,10,"All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man."
Deuteronomy,3,12,"And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day."
Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest."
Deuteronomy,3,22,Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
Deuteronomy,3,23,"And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see."
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you."
Deuteronomy,4,4,But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."
Deuteronomy,4,7,"For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?"
Deuteronomy,4,8,"And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;"
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children."
Deuteronomy,4,11,"And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
Deuteronomy,4,14,"And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it."
Deuteronomy,4,15,Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
Deuteronomy,4,16,"Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:"
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:"
Deuteronomy,4,22,"But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land."
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;"
Deuteronomy,4,31,"(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,"Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him."
Deuteronomy,4,36,"Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day."
Deuteronomy,4,39,"Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever."
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy,4,42,"That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,46,"On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:"
Deuteronomy,4,47,"And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,"
Deuteronomy,4,49,"And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day."
Deuteronomy,5,4,"The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,5,5,"(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
Deuteronomy,5,7,Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,"Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:"
Deuteronomy,5,9,"Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee."
Deuteronomy,5,13,"Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou."
Deuteronomy,5,15,"And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day."
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee."

Deuteronomy,5,21,"Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;"
Deuteronomy,5,24,"And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,"Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it."
Deuteronomy,5,28,"And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken."

Joshua,1,1,"Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,"
Joshua,1,2,"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel."
Joshua,1,3,"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast."
Joshua,1,5,"There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
Joshua,1,6,"Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them."
Joshua,1,7,"Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest."
Joshua,1,8,"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success."
Joshua,1,9,"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."
Joshua,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
Joshua,1,11,"Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it."
Joshua,1,12,"And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,1,13,"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land."
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;"
Joshua,1,15,"Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising."
Joshua,1,16,"And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go."
Joshua,1,17,"According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses."
Joshua,1,18,"Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage."
Joshua,2,1,"And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there."
Joshua,2,2,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country."
Joshua,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country."
Joshua,2,4,"And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:"
Joshua,2,5,"And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them."
Joshua,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof."
Joshua,2,7,"And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."
Joshua,2,8,"And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;"
Joshua,2,9,"And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed."
Joshua,2,11,"And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath."
Joshua,2,12,"Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:"
Joshua,2,13,"And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death."
Joshua,2,14,"And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee."
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way."
Joshua,2,17,"And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear."
Joshua,2,18,"Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee."
Joshua,2,19,"And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him."
Joshua,2,20,"And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear."
Joshua,2,21,"And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not."
Joshua,2,23,"So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:"
Joshua,2,24,"And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us."
Joshua,3,1,"And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over."
Joshua,3,2,"And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;"
Joshua,3,3,"And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it."
Joshua,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore."
Joshua,3,5,"And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you."
Joshua,3,6,"And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people."
Joshua,3,7,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee."
Joshua,3,8,"And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan."
Joshua,3,9,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God."
Joshua,3,10,"And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites."
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan."
Joshua,3,12,"Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man."
Joshua,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap."
Joshua,3,14,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;"
Joshua,3,15,"And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)"
Joshua,3,16,"That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho."
Joshua,3,17,"And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan."
Joshua,4,1,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,4,2,"Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,"
Joshua,4,3,"And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night."
Joshua,4,4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:"
Joshua,4,5,"And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:"
Joshua,4,6,"That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?"
Joshua,4,7,"Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever."
Joshua,4,8,"And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there."
Joshua,4,9,"And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day."
Joshua,4,10,"For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over."
Joshua,4,11,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people."
Joshua,4,12,"And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:"
Joshua,4,13,"About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho."
Joshua,4,14,"On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life."
Joshua,4,15,"And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,4,16,"Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan."
Joshua,4,17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan."
Joshua,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before."
Joshua,4,19,"And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho."
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal."
Joshua,4,21,"And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?"
Joshua,4,22,"Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land."
Joshua,4,23,"For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:"
Joshua,4,24,"That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever."
Joshua,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."
Joshua,5,3,"And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."
Joshua,5,4,"And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt."
Joshua,5,5,"Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised."
Joshua,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey."
Joshua,5,7,"And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way."
Joshua,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole."
Joshua,5,9,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day."
Joshua,5,10,"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho."
Joshua,5,11,"And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day."
Joshua,5,12,And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
Joshua,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?"
Joshua,5,14,"And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?"
Joshua,5,15,"And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so."
Joshua,6,1,"Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in."
Joshua,6,2,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour."
Joshua,6,3,"And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days."
Joshua,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets."
Joshua,6,5,"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him."
Joshua,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,7,"And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them."
Joshua,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,"And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout."
Joshua,6,11,"So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp."
Joshua,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,13,"And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets."
Joshua,6,14,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days."
Joshua,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times."
Joshua,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city."
Joshua,6,17,"And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent."
Joshua,6,18,"And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it."
Joshua,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD."
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
Joshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,6,22,"But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her."
Joshua,6,23,"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel."
Joshua,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD."
Joshua,6,25,"And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
Joshua,6,26,"And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."
Joshua,6,27,So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.
Joshua,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel."
Joshua,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai."
Joshua,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few."
Joshua,7,4,So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
Joshua,7,5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."
Joshua,7,6,"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!"
Joshua,7,8,"O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!"
Joshua,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?"
Joshua,7,10,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff."
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you."
Joshua,7,13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you."
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man."
Joshua,7,15,"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel."
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:"
Joshua,7,17,And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
Joshua,7,18,"And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
Joshua,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me."
Joshua,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:"
Joshua,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it."
Joshua,7,23,"And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD."
Joshua,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones."
Joshua,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day."
Joshua,8,1,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:"
Joshua,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it."
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night."
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:"
Joshua,8,5,"And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,"
Joshua,8,6,"(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,7,"Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand."
Joshua,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you."
Joshua,8,9,"Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people."
Joshua,8,10,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
Joshua,8,11,"And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai."
Joshua,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
Joshua,8,13,"And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
Joshua,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city."
Joshua,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
Joshua,8,16,"And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."
Joshua,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel."
Joshua,8,18,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city."
Joshua,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire."
Joshua,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
Joshua,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai."
Joshua,8,22,"And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
Joshua,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."
Joshua,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,8,25,"And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."
Joshua,8,26,"For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
Joshua,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua."
Joshua,8,28,"And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day."
Joshua,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,"
Joshua,8,31,"As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings."
Joshua,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel."
Joshua,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel."
Joshua,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them."
Joshua,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;"
Joshua,9,2,"That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
Joshua,9,3,"And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,"
Joshua,9,4,"They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;"
Joshua,9,5,"And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy."
Joshua,9,6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us."
Joshua,9,7,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?"
Joshua,9,8,"And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?"
Joshua,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,"
Joshua,9,10,"And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth."
Joshua,9,11,"Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us."
Joshua,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:"
Joshua,9,13,"And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey."
Joshua,9,14,"And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD."
Joshua,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them."
Joshua,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them."
Joshua,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim."
Joshua,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes."
Joshua,9,19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them."
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them."
Joshua,9,21,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them."
Joshua,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?"
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
Joshua,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do."
Joshua,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not."
Joshua,9,27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;"
Joshua,10,2,"That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty."
Joshua,10,3,"Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
Joshua,10,4,"Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
Joshua,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it."
Joshua,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us."
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour."
Joshua,10,8,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee."
Joshua,10,9,"Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night."
Joshua,10,10,"And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon."
Joshua,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day."
Joshua,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
Joshua,10,16,"But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah."
Joshua,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah."
Joshua,10,18,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:"
Joshua,10,19,"And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand."
Joshua,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities."
Joshua,10,21,And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
Joshua,10,22,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave."
Joshua,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
Joshua,10,25,"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight."
Joshua,10,26,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening."
Joshua,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day."
Joshua,10,28,"And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,29,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:"
Joshua,10,30,"And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:"
Joshua,10,32,"And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
Joshua,10,34,"And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:"
Joshua,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:"
Joshua,10,37,"And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein."
Joshua,10,38,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:"
Joshua,10,39,"And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king."
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded."
Joshua,10,41,"And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon."
Joshua,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
Joshua,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,"
Joshua,11,2,"And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,"
Joshua,11,3,"And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh."
Joshua,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many."
Joshua,11,5,"And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel."
Joshua,11,6,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them."
Joshua,11,8,"And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining."
Joshua,11,9,"And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire."
Joshua,11,10,"And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms."
Joshua,11,11,"And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire."
Joshua,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded."
Joshua,11,13,"But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn."
Joshua,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe."
Joshua,11,15,"As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;"
Joshua,11,17,"Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them."
Joshua,11,18,Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle."
Joshua,11,20,"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,21,"And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities."
Joshua,11,22,"There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war."
Joshua,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:"
Joshua,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;"
Joshua,12,3,"And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:"
Joshua,12,4,"And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,"
Joshua,12,5,"And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,"Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,12,7,"And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;"
Joshua,12,8,"In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:"
Joshua,12,9,"The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,10,"The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;"
Joshua,12,11,"The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;"
Joshua,12,12,"The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;"
Joshua,12,13,"The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;"
Joshua,12,14,"The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;"
Joshua,12,15,"The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;"
Joshua,12,16,"The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;"
Joshua,12,17,"The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;"
Joshua,12,18,"The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;"
Joshua,12,19,"The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;"
Joshua,12,20,"The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;"
Joshua,12,21,"The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;"
Joshua,12,22,"The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;"
Joshua,12,23,"The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;"
Joshua,12,24,"The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one."
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed."
Joshua,13,2,"This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,"
Joshua,13,3,"From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:"
Joshua,13,4,"From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:"
Joshua,13,5,"And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath."
Joshua,13,6,"All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee."
Joshua,13,7,"Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,"
Joshua,13,8,"With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;"
Joshua,13,9,"From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;"
Joshua,13,10,"And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;"
Joshua,13,11,"And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;"
Joshua,13,12,"All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out."
Joshua,13,13,"Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day."
Joshua,13,14,"Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them."
Joshua,13,15,And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
Joshua,13,16,"And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;"
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,"
Joshua,13,18,"And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,"
Joshua,13,19,"And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,"
Joshua,13,20,"And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,"
Joshua,13,21,"And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country."
Joshua,13,22,"Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them."
Joshua,13,23,"And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof."
Joshua,13,24,"And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families."
Joshua,13,25,"And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;"
Joshua,13,26,"And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;"
Joshua,13,27,"And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward."
Joshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages."
Joshua,13,29,And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
Joshua,13,30,"And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:"
Joshua,13,31,"And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families."
Joshua,13,32,"These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward."
Joshua,13,33,"But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them."
Joshua,14,1,"And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them."
Joshua,14,2,"By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe."
Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
Joshua,14,4,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance."
Joshua,14,5,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land."
Joshua,14,6,"Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea."
Joshua,14,7,Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.
Joshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
Joshua,14,9,"And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God."
Joshua,14,10,"And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old."
Joshua,14,11,"As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in."
Joshua,14,12,"Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said."
Joshua,14,13,"And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance."
Joshua,14,14,"Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel."
Joshua,14,15,And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua,15,1,This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.
Joshua,15,2,"And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:"
Joshua,15,3,"And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:"
Joshua,15,4,"From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast."
Joshua,15,5,"And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:"
Joshua,15,6,"And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:"
Joshua,15,7,"And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:"
Joshua,15,8,"And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:"
Joshua,15,9,"And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:"
Joshua,15,10,"And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:"
Joshua,15,11,"And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,"And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families."
Joshua,15,13,"And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron."
Joshua,15,14,"And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak."
Joshua,15,15,And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife."
Joshua,15,17,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife."
Joshua,15,18,"And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?"
Joshua,15,19,"Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs."
Joshua,15,20,This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
Joshua,15,21,"And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,"
Joshua,15,22,"And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,"
Joshua,15,23,"And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,"
Joshua,15,24,"Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,"
Joshua,15,25,"And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,"
Joshua,15,26,"Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,"
Joshua,15,27,"And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,"
Joshua,15,28,"And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,"
Joshua,15,29,"Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,"
Joshua,15,30,"And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,"
Joshua,15,31,"And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,"
Joshua,15,32,"And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:"
Joshua,15,33,"And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,"
Joshua,15,34,"And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,"
Joshua,15,35,"Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,"

Joshua,15,38,"And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,"
Joshua,15,39,"Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,"
Joshua,15,40,"And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,"
Joshua,15,41,"And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,42,"Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,"
Joshua,15,43,"And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,"
Joshua,15,44,"And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,45,"Ekron, with her towns and her villages:"
Joshua,15,46,"From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages:"
Joshua,15,47,"Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:"
Joshua,15,48,"And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,"
Joshua,15,49,"And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,"
Joshua,15,50,"And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,"
Joshua,15,51,"And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,52,"Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,"
Joshua,15,53,"And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,"
Joshua,15,54,"And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,55,"Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,"
Joshua,15,56,"And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,"
Joshua,15,57,"Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,58,"Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,"
Joshua,15,59,"And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,60,"Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:"
Joshua,15,61,"In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,"
Joshua,15,62,"And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages."
Joshua,15,63,"As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day."
Joshua,16,1,"And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,"
Joshua,16,2,"And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,"
Joshua,16,3,"And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea."
Joshua,16,4,"So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance."
Joshua,16,5,"And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;"
Joshua,16,6,"And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;"
Joshua,16,7,"And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan."
Joshua,16,8,The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
Joshua,16,9,"And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages."
Joshua,16,10,"And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute."
Joshua,17,1,"There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan."
Joshua,17,2,"There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families."
Joshua,17,3,"But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father."
Joshua,17,5,"And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;"
Joshua,17,6,Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
Joshua,17,7,"And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah."
Joshua,17,8,Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
Joshua,17,9,"And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:"
Joshua,17,10,"Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east."
Joshua,17,11,"And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries."
Joshua,17,12,Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Joshua,17,13,"Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out."
Joshua,17,14,"And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?"
Joshua,17,15,"And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee."
Joshua,17,16,"And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel."
Joshua,17,17,"And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:"
Joshua,17,18,"But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong."
Joshua,18,1,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them."
Joshua,18,2,"And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance."
Joshua,18,3,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?"
Joshua,18,4,"Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me."
Joshua,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north."
Joshua,18,6,"Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God."
Joshua,18,7,"But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
Joshua,18,8,"And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh."
Joshua,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh."
Joshua,18,10,And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
Joshua,18,11,And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Joshua,18,12,"And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven."
Joshua,18,13,"And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron."
Joshua,18,14,"And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter."
Joshua,18,15,"And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:"
Joshua,18,16,"And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,"
Joshua,18,17,"And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,"
Joshua,18,18,"And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:"
Joshua,18,19,And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.
Joshua,18,20,"And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families."
Joshua,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,"
Joshua,18,22,"And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,"
Joshua,18,23,"And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,"
Joshua,18,24,"And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:"
Joshua,18,25,"Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,"
Joshua,18,26,"And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,"
Joshua,18,27,"And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,"
Joshua,18,28,"And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families."
Joshua,19,1,"And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah."
Joshua,19,2,"And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah,"
Joshua,19,3,"And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,"
Joshua,19,4,"And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,"
Joshua,19,5,"And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,"
Joshua,19,6,"And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:"
Joshua,19,7,"Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:"
Joshua,19,8,"And all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families."
Joshua,19,9,Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.
Joshua,19,10,And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:
Joshua,19,11,"And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;"
Joshua,19,12,"And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,"
Joshua,19,13,"And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;"
Joshua,19,14,And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:
Joshua,19,15,"And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,16,"This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,17,"And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families."

Joshua,19,20,"And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,"
Joshua,19,21,"And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;"
Joshua,19,22,"And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,23,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,19,24,And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
Joshua,19,25,"And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,"
Joshua,19,26,"And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;"
Joshua,19,27,"And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,"
Joshua,19,28,"And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon;"
Joshua,19,29,"And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:"
Joshua,19,30,"Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,31,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,32,"The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families."
Joshua,19,33,"And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:"
Joshua,19,34,"And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising."

Joshua,19,46,"And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho."
Joshua,19,47,"And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father."
Joshua,19,48,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,49,"When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:"
Joshua,19,50,"According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein."
Joshua,19,51,"These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country."
Joshua,20,1,"The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,20,2,"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:"
Joshua,20,3,That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua,20,4,"And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them."
Joshua,20,5,"And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime."
Joshua,20,6,"And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled."
Joshua,20,7,"And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah."
Joshua,20,8,"And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,20,9,"These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation."
Joshua,21,1,"Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;"
Joshua,21,2,"And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle."
Joshua,21,3,"And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs."
Joshua,21,4,"And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities."
Joshua,21,5,"And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities."
Joshua,21,6,"And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities."
Joshua,21,7,"The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities."
Joshua,21,8,"And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses."
Joshua,21,9,"And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name."
Joshua,21,10,"Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot."
Joshua,21,11,"And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it."
Joshua,21,12,"But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession."
Joshua,21,13,"Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,14,"And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,15,"And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,16,"And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes."
Joshua,21,17,"And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,18,"Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,19,"All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs."
Joshua,21,20,"And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim."
Joshua,21,21,"For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,22,"And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,23,"And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,24,"Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,25,"And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities."
Joshua,21,26,All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
Joshua,21,27,"And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities."
Joshua,21,28,"And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,29,"Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,30,"And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,31,"Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,32,"And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities."
Joshua,21,33,All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
Joshua,21,34,"And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,35,"Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,36,"And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,37,"Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities."
Joshua,21,38,"And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,"
Joshua,21,39,"Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all."
Joshua,21,40,"So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities."
Joshua,21,41,All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
Joshua,21,42,These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.
Joshua,21,43,"And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein."
Joshua,21,44,"And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand."
Joshua,21,45,There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
Joshua,22,1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,"
Joshua,22,2,"And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:"
Joshua,22,3,"Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God."
Joshua,22,4,"And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan."
Joshua,22,5,"But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Joshua,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents."
Joshua,22,7,"Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,"
Joshua,22,8,"And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
Joshua,22,9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
Joshua,22,10,"And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to."
Joshua,22,11,"And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel."
Joshua,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them."
Joshua,22,13,"And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,"
Joshua,22,14,"And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel."
Joshua,22,15,"And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,"
Joshua,22,16,"Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?"
Joshua,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,"
Joshua,22,18,"But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel."
Joshua,22,19,"Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God."
Joshua,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
Joshua,22,21,"Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,"
Joshua,22,22,"The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)"
Joshua,22,23,"That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;"
Joshua,22,24,"And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?"
Joshua,22,25,"For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD."
Joshua,22,26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:"
Joshua,22,27,"But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD."
Joshua,22,28,"Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you."
Joshua,22,29,"God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle."
Joshua,22,30,"And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them."
Joshua,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD."
Joshua,22,32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again."
Joshua,22,33,"And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt."
Joshua,22,34,And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.
Joshua,23,1,"And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age."
Joshua,23,2,"And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:"
Joshua,23,3,And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.
Joshua,23,4,"Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward."
Joshua,23,5,"And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you."
Joshua,23,6,"Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;"
Joshua,23,7,"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:"
Joshua,23,8,"But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day."
Joshua,23,9,"For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day."
Joshua,23,10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you."
Joshua,23,11,"Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God."
Joshua,23,12,"Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:"
Joshua,23,13,"Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you."
Joshua,23,14,"And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof."
Joshua,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you."
Joshua,23,16,"When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you."
Joshua,24,1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God."
Joshua,24,2,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods."
Joshua,24,3,"And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac."
Joshua,24,4,"And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt."
Joshua,24,5,"I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out."
Joshua,24,6,And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
Joshua,24,7,"And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season."
Joshua,24,8,"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:"
Joshua,24,10,But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
Joshua,24,11,"And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand."
Joshua,24,12,"And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow."
Joshua,24,13,"And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat."
Joshua,24,14,"Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD."
Joshua,24,15,"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
Joshua,24,16,"And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;"
Joshua,24,17,"For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:"
Joshua,24,18,"And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God."
Joshua,24,19,"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins."
Joshua,24,20,"If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good."
Joshua,24,21,"And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD."
Joshua,24,22,"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses."
Joshua,24,23,"Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel."
Joshua,24,24,"And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey."
Joshua,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem."
Joshua,24,26,"And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD."
Joshua,24,27,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God."
Joshua,24,28,"So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance."
Joshua,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old."
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash."
Joshua,24,31,"And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel."
Joshua,24,32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim."
Judges,1,1,"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?"
Judges,1,2,"And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
Judges,1,3,"And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him."
Judges,1,4,And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
Judges,1,5,"And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
Judges,1,6,"But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
Judges,1,7,"And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died."
Judges,1,8,"Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire."
Judges,1,9,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley."
Judges,1,10,"And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai."
Judges,1,11,And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:
Judges,1,12,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife."
Judges,1,13,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife."
Judges,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?"
Judges,1,15,"And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs."
Judges,1,16,"And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people."
Judges,1,17,"And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah."
Judges,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof."
Judges,1,19,"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."
Judges,1,20,"And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak."
Judges,1,21,And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
Judges,1,22,"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them."
Judges,1,23,And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
Judges,1,24,"And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy."
Judges,1,25,"And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family."
Judges,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day."
Judges,1,27,"Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land."
Judges,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out."
Judges,1,29,Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
Judges,1,30,"Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries."
Judges,1,31,"Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:"
Judges,1,32,"But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out."
Judges,1,33,"Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them."
Judges,1,34,And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
Judges,1,35,"But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries."
Judges,1,36,"And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward."
Judges,2,1,"And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you."
Judges,2,2,And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
Judges,2,3,"Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you."
Judges,2,4,"And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
Judges,2,5,And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.
Judges,2,6,"And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land."
Judges,2,7,"And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel."
Judges,2,8,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old."
Judges,2,9,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash."
Judges,2,10,"And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel."
Judges,2,11,"And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:"
Judges,2,12,"And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger."
Judges,2,13,"And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth."
Judges,2,14,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies."
Judges,2,15,"Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed."
Judges,2,16,"Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them."
Judges,2,17,"And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so."
Judges,2,18,"And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them."
Judges,2,19,"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way."
Judges,2,20,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;"
Judges,2,21,I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
Judges,2,22,"That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not."
Judges,2,23,"Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua."
Judges,3,1,"Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;"
Judges,3,2,"Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;"
Judges,3,3,"Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath."
Judges,3,4,"And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses."
Judges,3,5,"And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:"
Judges,3,6,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods."
Judges,3,7,"And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves."
Judges,3,8,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years."
Judges,3,9,"And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother."
Judges,3,10,"And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim."
Judges,3,11,And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges,3,12,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD."
Judges,3,13,"And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees."
Judges,3,14,So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab."
Judges,3,16,"But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh."
Judges,3,17,And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges,3,18,"And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present."
Judges,3,19,"But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him."
Judges,3,20,"And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat."
Judges,3,21,"And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:"
Judges,3,22,"And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out."
Judges,3,23,"Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them."
Judges,3,24,"When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber."
Judges,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth."
Judges,3,26,"And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath."
Judges,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them."
Judges,3,28,"And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over."
Judges,3,29,"And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man."
Judges,3,30,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
Judges,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel."
Judges,4,1,"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead."
Judges,4,2,"And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles."
Judges,4,3,And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
Judges,4,4,"And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time."
Judges,4,5,And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges,4,6,"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?"
Judges,4,7,"And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand."
Judges,4,8,"And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go."
Judges,4,9,"And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh."
Judges,4,10,And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
Judges,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh."
Judges,4,12,And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
Judges,4,13,"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon."
Judges,4,14,"And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him."
Judges,4,15,"And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet."
Judges,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left."
Judges,4,17,Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle."
Judges,4,19,"And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him."
Judges,4,20,"Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No."
Judges,4,21,"Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died."
Judges,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples."
Judges,4,23,So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
Judges,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
Judges,5,1,"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,"
Judges,5,2,"Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves."
Judges,5,3,"Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel."
Judges,5,4,"LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water."
Judges,5,5,"The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel."
Judges,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways."
Judges,5,7,"The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel."
Judges,5,8,They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
Judges,5,9,"My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD."
Judges,5,10,"Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way."
Judges,5,11,"They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates."
Judges,5,12,"Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam."
Judges,5,13,Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
Judges,5,14,"Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer."
Judges,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart."
Judges,5,16,"Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart."
Judges,5,17,"Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches."
Judges,5,18,Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
Judges,5,19,"The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money."
Judges,5,20,They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
Judges,5,21,"The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength."
Judges,5,22,"Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones."
Judges,5,23,"Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty."
Judges,5,24,"Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent."
Judges,5,25,"He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish."
Judges,5,26,"She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples."
Judges,5,27,"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."
Judges,5,28,"The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?"
Judges,5,29,"Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,"
Judges,5,30,"Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?"
Judges,5,31,"So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years."
Judges,6,1,And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
Judges,6,2,"And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds."
Judges,6,3,"And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;"
Judges,6,4,"And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass."
Judges,6,5,"For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it."
Judges,6,6,And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
Judges,6,7,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,"
Judges,6,8,"That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;"
Judges,6,9,"And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;"
Judges,6,10,"And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice."
Judges,6,11,"And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites."
Judges,6,12,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour."
Judges,6,13,"And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites."
Judges,6,14,"And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?"
Judges,6,15,"And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."
Judges,6,16,"And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man."
Judges,6,17,"And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me."
Judges,6,18,"Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again."
Judges,6,19,"And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it."
Judges,6,20,"And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so."
Judges,6,21,"Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight."
Judges,6,22,"And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face."
Judges,6,23,"And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die."
Judges,6,24,"Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
Judges,6,25,"And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:"
Judges,6,26,"And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down."
Judges,6,27,"Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night."
Judges,6,28,"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built."
Judges,6,29,"And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing."
Judges,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it."
Judges,6,31,"And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar."
Judges,6,32,"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar."
Judges,6,33,"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel."
Judges,6,34,"But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him."
Judges,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them."
Judges,6,36,"And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,"
Judges,6,37,"Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said."
Judges,6,38,"And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water."
Judges,6,39,"And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew."
Judges,6,40,"And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground."
Judges,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley."
Judges,7,2,"And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me."
Judges,7,3,"Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand."
Judges,7,4,"And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go."
Judges,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink."
Judges,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water."
Judges,7,7,"And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place."
Judges,7,8,"So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley."
Judges,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand."
Judges,7,10,"But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:"
Judges,7,11,And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
Judges,7,12,"And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude."
Judges,7,13,"And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along."
Judges,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host."
Judges,7,15,"And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian."
Judges,7,16,"And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."
Judges,7,17,"And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do."
Judges,7,18,"When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."
Judges,7,19,"So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands."
Judges,7,20,"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."
Judges,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled."
Judges,7,22,"And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath."
Judges,7,23,"And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites."
Judges,7,24,"And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan."
Judges,7,25,"And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan."
Judges,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply."
Judges,8,2,"And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
Judges,8,3,"God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that."
Judges,8,4,"And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them."
Judges,8,5,"And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian."
Judges,8,6,"And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?"
Judges,8,7,"And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
Judges,8,8,"And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him."
Judges,8,9,"And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
Judges,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword."
Judges,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure."
Judges,8,12,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host."
Judges,8,13,"And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,"
Judges,8,14,"And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men."
Judges,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?"
Judges,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth."
Judges,8,17,"And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city."
Judges,8,18,"Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king."
Judges,8,19,"And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you."
Judges,8,20,"And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth."
Judges,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks."
Judges,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian."
Judges,8,23,"And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you."
Judges,8,24,"And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)"
Judges,8,25,"And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey."
Judges,8,26,"And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks."
Judges,8,27,"And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house."
Judges,8,28,"Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon."
Judges,8,29,And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges,8,30,And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
Judges,8,31,"And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech."
Judges,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
Judges,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god."
Judges,8,34,"And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:"
Judges,8,35,"Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel."
Judges,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,"
Judges,9,2,"Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
Judges,9,3,"And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother."
Judges,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him."
Judges,9,5,"And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself."
Judges,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem."
Judges,9,7,"And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you."
Judges,9,8,"The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us."
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
Judges,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us."
Judges,9,11,"But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
Judges,9,12,"Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us."
Judges,9,13,"And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
Judges,9,14,"Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us."
Judges,9,15,"And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon."
Judges,9,16,"Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;"
Judges,9,17,"(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:"
Judges,9,18,"And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)"
Judges,9,19,"If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:"
Judges,9,20,"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."
Judges,9,21,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
Judges,9,22,"When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,"
Judges,9,23,Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
Judges,9,24,"That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren."
Judges,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech."
Judges,9,26,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him."
Judges,9,27,"And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech."
Judges,9,28,"And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?"
Judges,9,29,"And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out."
Judges,9,30,"And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled."
Judges,9,31,"And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee."
Judges,9,32,"Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:"
Judges,9,33,"And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion."
Judges,9,34,"And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies."
Judges,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait."
Judges,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."
Judges,9,37,"And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim."
Judges,9,38,"Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them."
Judges,9,39,"And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
Judges,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate."
Judges,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem."
Judges,9,42,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech."
Judges,9,43,"And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them."
Judges,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them."
Judges,9,45,"And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt."
Judges,9,46,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith."
Judges,9,47,"And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together."
Judges,9,48,"And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done."
Judges,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women."
Judges,9,50,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it."
Judges,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower."
Judges,9,52,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire."
Judges,9,53,"And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull."
Judges,9,54,"Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died."
Judges,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place."
Judges,9,56,"Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:"
Judges,9,57,And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
Judges,10,1,"And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim."
Judges,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir."
Judges,10,3,"And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years."
Judges,10,4,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead."
Judges,10,5,"And Jair died, and was buried in Camon."
Judges,10,6,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him."
Judges,10,7,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon."
Judges,10,8,"And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead."
Judges,10,9,"Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed."
Judges,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim."
Judges,10,11,"And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?"
Judges,10,12,"The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand."
Judges,10,13,"Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more."
Judges,10,14,Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
Judges,10,15,"And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day."
Judges,10,16,"And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel."
Judges,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh."
Judges,10,18,"And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
Judges,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah."
Judges,11,2,"And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman."
Judges,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him."
Judges,11,4,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel."
Judges,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:"
Judges,11,6,"And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
Judges,11,7,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?"
Judges,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
Judges,11,9,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
Judges,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words."
Judges,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh."
Judges,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?"
Judges,11,13,"And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably."
Judges,11,14,And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:
Judges,11,15,"And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:"
Judges,11,16,"But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;"
Judges,11,17,"Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh."
Judges,11,18,"Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab."
Judges,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place."
Judges,11,20,"But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
Judges,11,21,"And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country."
Judges,11,22,"And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan."
Judges,11,23,"So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?"
Judges,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess."
Judges,11,25,"And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,"
Judges,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?"
Judges,11,27,"Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
Judges,11,28,Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
Judges,11,29,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon."
Judges,11,30,"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,"
Judges,11,31,"Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."
Judges,11,32,So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
Judges,11,33,"And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel."
Judges,11,34,"And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter."
Judges,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back."
Judges,11,36,"And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon."
Judges,11,37,"And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows."
Judges,11,38,"And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains."
Judges,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,"
Judges,11,40,That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
Judges,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire."
Judges,12,2,"And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands."
Judges,12,3,"And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"
Judges,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites."
Judges,12,5,"And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;"
Judges,12,6,"Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand."
Judges,12,7,"And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead."
Judges,12,8,And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
Judges,12,9,"And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years."
Judges,12,10,"Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem."
Judges,12,11,"And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years."
Judges,12,12,"And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun."
Judges,12,13,"And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel."
Judges,12,14,"And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years."
Judges,12,15,"And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites."
Judges,13,1,And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
Judges,13,2,"And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not."
Judges,13,3,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son."
Judges,13,4,"Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:"
Judges,13,5,"For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
Judges,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:"
Judges,13,7,"But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death."
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born."
Judges,13,9,And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges,13,10,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day."
Judges,13,11,"And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am."
Judges,13,12,"And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?"
Judges,13,13,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware."
Judges,13,14,"She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe."
Judges,13,15,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee."
Judges,13,16,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD."
Judges,13,17,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?"
Judges,13,18,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?"
Judges,13,19,"So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on."
Judges,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground."
Judges,13,21,But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.
Judges,13,22,"And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God."
Judges,13,23,"But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these."
Judges,13,24,"And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him."
Judges,13,25,And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges,14,1,"And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines."
Judges,14,2,"And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife."
Judges,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."
Judges,14,4,"But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel."
Judges,14,5,"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him."
Judges,14,6,"And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done."
Judges,14,7,"And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well."
Judges,14,8,"And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion."
Judges,14,9,"And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion."
Judges,14,10,So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
Judges,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
Judges,14,12,"And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:"
Judges,14,13,"But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it."
Judges,14,14,"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle."
Judges,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?"
Judges,14,16,"And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?"
Judges,14,17,"And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people."
Judges,14,18,"And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle."
Judges,14,19,"And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house."
Judges,14,20,"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend."
Judges,15,1,"But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in."
Judges,15,2,"And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."
Judges,15,3,"And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure."
Judges,15,4,"And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails."
Judges,15,5,"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives."
Judges,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."
Judges,15,7,"And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
Judges,15,8,And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
Judges,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi."
Judges,15,10,"And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us."
Judges,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them."
Judges,15,12,"And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves."
Judges,15,13,"And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock."
Judges,15,14,"And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands."
Judges,15,15,"And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith."
Judges,15,16,"And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men."
Judges,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi."
Judges,15,18,"And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
Judges,15,19,"But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day."
Judges,15,20,And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Judges,16,1,"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her."
Judges,16,2,"And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him."
Judges,16,3,"And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron."
Judges,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
Judges,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver."
Judges,16,6,"And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee."
Judges,16,7,"And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
Judges,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
Judges,16,9,"Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known."
Judges,16,10,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound."
Judges,16,11,"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
Judges,16,12,"Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread."
Judges,16,13,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web."
Judges,16,14,"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."
Judges,16,15,"And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth."
Judges,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;"
Judges,16,17,"That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."
Judges,16,18,"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand."
Judges,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."
Judges,16,20,"And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him."
Judges,16,21,"But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."
Judges,16,22,Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
Judges,16,23,"Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."
Judges,16,24,"And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us."
Judges,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars."
Judges,16,26,"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them."
Judges,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport."
Judges,16,28,"And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
Judges,16,29,"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left."
Judges,16,30,"And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life."
Judges,16,31,"Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years."
Judges,17,1,"And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah."
Judges,17,2,"And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son."
Judges,17,3,"And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee."
Judges,17,4,"Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah."
Judges,17,5,"And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
Judges,17,6,"In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
Judges,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there."
Judges,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed."
Judges,17,9,"And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place."
Judges,17,10,"And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in."
Judges,17,11,And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
Judges,17,12,"And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah."
Judges,17,13,"Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest."
Judges,18,1,In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
Judges,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there."
Judges,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?"
Judges,18,4,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest."
Judges,18,5,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
Judges,18,6,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go."
Judges,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man."
Judges,18,8,"And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?"
Judges,18,9,"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land."
Judges,18,10,"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth."
Judges,18,11,"And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,12,"And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim."
Judges,18,13,"And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah."
Judges,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do."
Judges,18,15,"And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him."
Judges,18,16,"And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate."
Judges,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,18,"And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?"
Judges,18,19,"And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?"
Judges,18,20,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."
Judges,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them."
Judges,18,22,"And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan."
Judges,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?"
Judges,18,24,"And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?"
Judges,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household."
Judges,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house."
Judges,18,27,"And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire."
Judges,18,28,"And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein."
Judges,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first."
Judges,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land."
Judges,18,31,"And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
Judges,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah."
Judges,19,2,"And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months."
Judges,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him."
Judges,19,4,"And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there."
Judges,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way."
Judges,19,6,"And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry."
Judges,19,7,"And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again."
Judges,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them."
Judges,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home."
Judges,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him."
Judges,19,11,"And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it."
Judges,19,12,"And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah."
Judges,19,13,"And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah."
Judges,19,14,"And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin."
Judges,19,15,"And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging."
Judges,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites."
Judges,19,17,"And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?"
Judges,19,18,"And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house."
Judges,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing."
Judges,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street."
Judges,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink."
Judges,19,22,"Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him."
Judges,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly."
Judges,19,24,"Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing."
Judges,19,25,"But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go."
Judges,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light."
Judges,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold."
Judges,19,28,"And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place."
Judges,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel."
Judges,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds."
Judges,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh."
Judges,20,2,"And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."
Judges,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?"
Judges,20,4,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge."
Judges,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead."
Judges,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel."
Judges,20,7,"Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel."
Judges,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house."
Judges,20,9,But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;
Judges,20,10,"And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel."
Judges,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man."
Judges,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?"
Judges,20,13,"Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel."
Judges,20,14,"But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel."
Judges,20,15,"And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men."
Judges,20,16,"Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss."
Judges,20,17,"And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war."
Judges,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first."
Judges,20,19,"And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah."
Judges,20,20,And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
Judges,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men."
Judges,20,22,"And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day."
Judges,20,23,"(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)"
Judges,20,24,And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
Judges,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
Judges,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
Judges,20,27,"And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,"
Judges,20,28,"And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand."
Judges,20,29,And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
Judges,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times."
Judges,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
Judges,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways."
Judges,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah."
Judges,20,34,"And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them."
Judges,20,35,And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
Judges,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah."
Judges,20,37,"And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword."
Judges,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city."
Judges,20,39,"And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle."
Judges,20,40,"But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven."
Judges,20,41,"And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them."
Judges,20,42,Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
Judges,20,43,"Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising."
Judges,20,44,And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
Judges,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them."
Judges,20,46,So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
Judges,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months."
Judges,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to."
Judges,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife."
Judges,21,2,"And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;"
Judges,21,3,"And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?"
Judges,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
Judges,21,5,"And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death."
Judges,21,6,"And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
Judges,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"
Judges,21,8,"And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly."
Judges,21,9,"For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there."
Judges,21,10,"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."
Judges,21,11,"And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man."
Judges,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
Judges,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them."
Judges,21,14,And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
Judges,21,15,"And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel."
Judges,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
Judges,21,17,"And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel."
Judges,21,18,"Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin."
Judges,21,19,"Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah."
Judges,21,20,"Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;"
Judges,21,21,"And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
Judges,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty."
Judges,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them."
Judges,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance."
Judges,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Ruth,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there."
Ruth,1,3,"And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons."
Ruth,1,4,"And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years."
Ruth,1,5,And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread."
Ruth,1,7,"Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah."
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me."
Ruth,1,9,"The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people."
Ruth,1,11,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
Ruth,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;"
Ruth,1,13,"Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her."
Ruth,1,15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law."
Ruth,1,16,"And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:"
Ruth,1,17,"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me."
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her."
Ruth,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?"
Ruth,1,20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter."
Ruth,2,3,"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee."
Ruth,2,5,"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?"
Ruth,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:"
Ruth,2,7,"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house."
Ruth,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:"
Ruth,2,9,"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn."
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"
Ruth,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore."
Ruth,2,12,"The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust."
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens."
Ruth,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left."
Ruth,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:"
Ruth,2,16,"And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not."
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed."
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz."
Ruth,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen."
Ruth,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."
Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field."
Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
Ruth,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
Ruth,3,2,"And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor."
Ruth,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do."
Ruth,3,5,"And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do."
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her."
Ruth,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
Ruth,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."
Ruth,3,9,"And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman."
Ruth,3,10,"And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich."
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman."
Ruth,3,12,And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning."
Ruth,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor."
Ruth,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city."
Ruth,3,16,"And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."
Ruth,3,17,"And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law."
Ruth,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day."
Ruth,4,1,"Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:"
Ruth,4,4,"And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it."
Ruth,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."
Ruth,4,6,"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it."
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel."
Ruth,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe."
Ruth,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi."
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day."
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:"
Ruth,4,12,"And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman."
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son."
Ruth,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel."
Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him."
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,"
Ruth,4,19,"And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,"
Ruth,4,20,"And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
Ruth,4,21,"And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
Ruth,4,22,"And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:"
1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there."
1 Samuel,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
1 Samuel,1,5,But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel,1,6,"And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb."
1 Samuel,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore."
1 Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken."
1 Samuel,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee."
1 Samuel,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,16,Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
1 Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him."
1 Samuel,1,18,"And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad."
1 Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her."
1 Samuel,1,20,"Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever."
1 Samuel,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him."
1 Samuel,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young."
1 Samuel,1,25,"And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli."
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
1 Samuel,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
1 Samuel,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."
1 Samuel,2,7,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;"
1 Samuel,2,14,"And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither."
1 Samuel,2,15,"Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw."
1 Samuel,2,16,"And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force."
1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
1 Samuel,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people."
1 Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress."
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men."
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?"
1 Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house."
1 Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever."
1 Samuel,2,33,"And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age."
1 Samuel,2,34,"And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them."
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever."
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."
1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;"
1 Samuel,3,3,"And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;"
1 Samuel,3,4,"That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I."
1 Samuel,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
1 Samuel,3,6,"And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again."
1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him."
1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child."
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth."
1 Samuel,3,11,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle."
1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end."
1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not."
1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever."
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision."
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I."
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee."
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good."
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek."
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men."
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies."
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp."
1 Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight."
1 Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head."
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out."
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli."
1 Samuel,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see."
1 Samuel,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?"
1 Samuel,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken."
1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her."
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it."
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband."
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken."
1 Samuel,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod."
1 Samuel,5,2,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
1 Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again."
1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him."
1 Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof."
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god."
1 Samuel,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither."
1 Samuel,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts."
1 Samuel,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people."
1 Samuel,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place."
1 Samuel,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
1 Samuel,6,4,"Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords."
1 Samuel,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
1 Samuel,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:"
1 Samuel,6,8,"And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go."
1 Samuel,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us."
1 Samuel,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:"
1 Samuel,6,11,"And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods."
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,"And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
1 Samuel,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
1 Samuel,6,17,"And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;"
1 Samuel,6,18,"And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite."
1 Samuel,6,19,"And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter."
1 Samuel,6,20,"And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?"
1 Samuel,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you."
1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh."
1 Samuel,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him."
1 Samuel,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel."
1 Samuel,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar."
1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us."
1 Samuel,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
1 Samuel,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places."
1 Samuel,7,17,And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
1 Samuel,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
1 Samuel,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba."
1 Samuel,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment."
1 Samuel,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,"
1 Samuel,8,5,"And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
1 Samuel,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,7,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them."
1 Samuel,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee."
1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them."
1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,13,"And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers."
1 Samuel,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants."
1 Samuel,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
1 Samuel,8,16,"And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work."
1 Samuel,8,17,He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
1 Samuel,8,18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
1 Samuel,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;"
1 Samuel,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
1 Samuel,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,22,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city."
1 Samuel,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power."
1 Samuel,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people."
1 Samuel,9,3,"And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses."
1 Samuel,9,4,"And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not."
1 Samuel,9,5,"And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us."
1 Samuel,9,6,"And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go."
1 Samuel,9,7,"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"
1 Samuel,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way."
1 Samuel,9,9,"(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)"
1 Samuel,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was."
1 Samuel,9,11,"And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
1 Samuel,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:"
1 Samuel,9,13,"As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him."
1 Samuel,9,14,"And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,"
1 Samuel,9,16,"To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me."
1 Samuel,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people."
1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is."
1 Samuel,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart."
1 Samuel,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?"
1 Samuel,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?"
1 Samuel,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons."
1 Samuel,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee."
1 Samuel,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house."
1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad."
1 Samuel,9,27,"And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God."
1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?"
1 Samuel,10,2,"When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"
1 Samuel,10,4,"And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands."
1 Samuel,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:"
1 Samuel,10,6,"And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man."
1 Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee."
1 Samuel,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do."
1 Samuel,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day."
1 Samuel,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
1 Samuel,10,14,"And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel."
1 Samuel,10,15,"And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you."
1 Samuel,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not."
1 Samuel,10,17,And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
1 Samuel,10,18,"And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:"
1 Samuel,10,19,"And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands."
1 Samuel,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
1 Samuel,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff."
1 Samuel,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
1 Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king."
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house."
1 Samuel,10,26,"And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace."
1 Samuel,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee."
1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel."
1 Samuel,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee."
1 Samuel,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept."
1 Samuel,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh."
1 Samuel,11,6,"And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly."
1 Samuel,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent."
1 Samuel,11,8,"And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
1 Samuel,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you."
1 Samuel,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together."
1 Samuel,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death."
1 Samuel,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel."
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
1 Samuel,11,15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you."
1 Samuel,12,4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand."
1 Samuel,12,5,"And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness."
1 Samuel,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt."
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place."
1 Samuel,12,9,"And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them."
1 Samuel,12,10,"And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee."
1 Samuel,12,11,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe."
1 Samuel,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king."
1 Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:"
1 Samuel,12,15,"But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,16,"Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes."
1 Samuel,12,17,"Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king."
1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king."
1 Samuel,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;"
1 Samuel,12,21,"And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain."
1 Samuel,12,22,For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:"
1 Samuel,12,24,"Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you."
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king."
1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
1 Samuel,13,2,"Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
1 Samuel,13,3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear."
1 Samuel,13,4,"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal."
1 Samuel,13,5,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven."
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
1 Samuel,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
1 Samuel,13,9,"And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;"
1 Samuel,13,12,"Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee."
1 Samuel,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men."
1 Samuel,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
1 Samuel,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:"
1 Samuel,13,18,And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:"
1 Samuel,13,20,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock."
1 Samuel,13,21,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads."
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father."
1 Samuel,14,2,And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
1 Samuel,14,3,"And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone."
1 Samuel,14,4,"And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
1 Samuel,14,5,"The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah."
1 Samuel,14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few."
1 Samuel,14,7,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart."
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them."
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them."
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us."
1 Samuel,14,11,"And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
1 Samuel,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel."
1 Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him."
1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow."
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another."
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there."
1 Samuel,14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel."
1 Samuel,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand."
1 Samuel,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture."
1 Samuel,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan."
1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
1 Samuel,14,23,So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
1 Samuel,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food."
1 Samuel,14,25,And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath."
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint."
1 Samuel,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"
1 Samuel,14,31,And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
1 Samuel,14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood."
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day."
1 Samuel,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there."
1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
1 Samuel,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God."
1 Samuel,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day."
1 Samuel,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day."
1 Samuel,14,39,"For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him."
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee."
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped."
1 Samuel,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die."
1 Samuel,14,44,"And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan."
1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not."
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them."
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:"
1 Samuel,14,50,"And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle."
1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
1 Samuel,15,4,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
1 Samuel,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
1 Samuel,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night."
1 Samuel,15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
1 Samuel,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?"
1 Samuel,15,18,"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed."
1 Samuel,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king."
1 Samuel,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent."
1 Samuel,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou."
1 Samuel,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent."
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God."
1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons."
1 Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD."
1 Samuel,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee."
1 Samuel,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him."
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart."
1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this."
1 Samuel,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this."
1 Samuel,16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these."
1 Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither."
1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he."
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah."
1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee."
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well."
1 Samuel,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me."
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him."
1 Samuel,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep."
1 Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul."
1 Samuel,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer."
1 Samuel,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight."
1 Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim."
1 Samuel,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines."
1 Samuel,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them."
1 Samuel,17,4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
1 Samuel,17,5,"And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass."
1 Samuel,17,6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders."
1 Samuel,17,7,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
1 Samuel,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."
1 Samuel,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul."
1 Samuel,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
1 Samuel,17,14,And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
1 Samuel,17,15,But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
1 Samuel,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren;"
1 Samuel,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge."
1 Samuel,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
1 Samuel,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle."
1 Samuel,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army."
1 Samuel,17,22,"And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren."
1 Samuel,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them."
1 Samuel,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid."
1 Samuel,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."
1 Samuel,17,26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
1 Samuel,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
1 Samuel,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."
1 Samuel,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"
1 Samuel,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
1 Samuel,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him."
1 Samuel,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
1 Samuel,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
1 Samuel,17,35,"And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him."
1 Samuel,17,36,"Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God."
1 Samuel,17,37,"David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee."
1 Samuel,17,38,"And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail."
1 Samuel,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him."
1 Samuel,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance."
1 Samuel,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
1 Samuel,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
1 Samuel,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied."
1 Samuel,17,46,"This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."
1 Samuel,17,47,"And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands."
1 Samuel,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."
1 Samuel,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David."
1 Samuel,17,51,"Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled."
1 Samuel,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron."
1 Samuel,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents."
1 Samuel,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent."
1 Samuel,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell."
1 Samuel,17,56,"And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is."
1 Samuel,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
1 Samuel,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
1 Samuel,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house."
1 Samuel,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle."
1 Samuel,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick."
1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
1 Samuel,18,8,"And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?"
1 Samuel,18,9,And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1 Samuel,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice."
1 Samuel,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul."
1 Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
1 Samuel,18,14,And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
1 Samuel,18,15,"Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him."
1 Samuel,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them."
1 Samuel,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."
1 Samuel,18,18,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?"
1 Samuel,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife."
1 Samuel,18,20,"And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
1 Samuel,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain."
1 Samuel,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law."
1 Samuel,18,23,"And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
1 Samuel,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David."
1 Samuel,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired."
1 Samuel,18,27,"Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife."
1 Samuel,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him."
1 Samuel,18,29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by."
1 Samuel,19,1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David."
1 Samuel,19,2,"But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:"
1 Samuel,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee."
1 Samuel,19,4,"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:"
1 Samuel,19,5,"For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"
1 Samuel,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain."
1 Samuel,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past."
1 Samuel,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him."
1 Samuel,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand."
1 Samuel,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain."
1 Samuel,19,12,"So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
1 Samuel,19,13,"And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth."
1 Samuel,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick."
1 Samuel,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster."
1 Samuel,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?"
1 Samuel,19,18,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth."
1 Samuel,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
1 Samuel,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
1 Samuel,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
1 Samuel,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah."
1 Samuel,19,23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
1 Samuel,19,24,"And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?"
1 Samuel,20,2,"And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so."
1 Samuel,20,3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death."
1 Samuel,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee."
1 Samuel,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family."
1 Samuel,20,7,"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"
1 Samuel,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
1 Samuel,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?"
1 Samuel,20,11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
1 Samuel,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;"
1 Samuel,20,13,"The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father."
1 Samuel,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:"
1 Samuel,20,15,"But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth."
1 Samuel,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies."
1 Samuel,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
1 Samuel,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty."
1 Samuel,20,19,"And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel."
1 Samuel,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark."
1 Samuel,20,21,"And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth."
1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away."
1 Samuel,20,23,"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever."
1 Samuel,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat."
1 Samuel,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty."
1 Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean."
1 Samuel,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?"
1 Samuel,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:"
1 Samuel,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table."
1 Samuel,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?"
1 Samuel,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."
1 Samuel,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?"
1 Samuel,20,33,And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
1 Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."
1 Samuel,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."
1 Samuel,20,36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
1 Samuel,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?"
1 Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1 Samuel,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city."
1 Samuel,20,41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded."
1 Samuel,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."
1 Samuel,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?"
1 Samuel,21,2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place."
1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present."
1 Samuel,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women."
1 Samuel,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."
1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away."
1 Samuel,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul."
1 Samuel,21,8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
1 Samuel,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me."
1 Samuel,21,10,"And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
1 Samuel,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,13,"And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
1 Samuel,21,14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?"
1 Samuel,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?"
1 Samuel,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him."
1 Samuel,22,2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
1 Samuel,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me."
1 Samuel,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
1 Samuel,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth."
1 Samuel,22,6,"When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)"
1 Samuel,22,7,"Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;"
1 Samuel,22,8,"That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
1 Samuel,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
1 Samuel,22,10,"And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
1 Samuel,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king."
1 Samuel,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord."
1 Samuel,22,13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
1 Samuel,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?"
1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more."
1 Samuel,22,16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house."
1 Samuel,22,17,"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD."
1 Samuel,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
1 Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.
1 Samuel,22,22,"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house."
1 Samuel,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard."
1 Samuel,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors."
1 Samuel,23,2,"Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."
1 Samuel,23,3,"And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
1 Samuel,23,4,"Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand."
1 Samuel,23,5,"So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
1 Samuel,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand."
1 Samuel,23,7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars."
1 Samuel,23,8,"And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
1 Samuel,23,9,"And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod."
1 Samuel,23,10,"Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake."
1 Samuel,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down."
1 Samuel,23,12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up."
1 Samuel,23,13,"Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth."
1 Samuel,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
1 Samuel,23,15,And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
1 Samuel,23,16,"And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God."
1 Samuel,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth."
1 Samuel,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house."
1 Samuel,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?"
1 Samuel,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand."
1 Samuel,23,21,"And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me."
1 Samuel,23,22,"Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly."
1 Samuel,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah."
1 Samuel,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon."
1 Samuel,23,25,"Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon."
1 Samuel,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them."
1 Samuel,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land."
1 Samuel,23,28,"Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth."
1 Samuel,23,29,"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi."
1 Samuel,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
1 Samuel,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
1 Samuel,24,3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave."
1 Samuel,24,4,"And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily."
1 Samuel,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt."
1 Samuel,24,6,"And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD."
1 Samuel,24,7,"So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way."
1 Samuel,24,8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself."
1 Samuel,24,9,"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?"
1 Samuel,24,10,"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed."
1 Samuel,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it."
1 Samuel,24,12,"The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee."
1 Samuel,24,13,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee."
1 Samuel,24,14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
1 Samuel,24,15,"The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand."
1 Samuel,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept."
1 Samuel,24,17,"And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil."
1 Samuel,24,18,"And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not."
1 Samuel,24,19,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day."
1 Samuel,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand."
1 Samuel,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house."
1 Samuel,24,22,And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
1 Samuel,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
1 Samuel,25,2,"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
1 Samuel,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb."
1 Samuel,25,4,And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
1 Samuel,25,5,"And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"
1 Samuel,25,6,"And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast."
1 Samuel,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel."
1 Samuel,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David."
1 Samuel,25,9,"And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."
1 Samuel,25,10,"And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master."
1 Samuel,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?"
1 Samuel,25,12,"So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings."
1 Samuel,25,13,"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff."
1 Samuel,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them."
1 Samuel,25,15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:"
1 Samuel,25,16,"They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
1 Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him."
1 Samuel,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses."
1 Samuel,25,19,"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."
1 Samuel,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them."
1 Samuel,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good."
1 Samuel,25,22,"So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall."
1 Samuel,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
1 Samuel,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid."
1 Samuel,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send."
1 Samuel,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal."
1 Samuel,25,27,"And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord."
1 Samuel,25,28,"I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days."
1 Samuel,25,29,"Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling."
1 Samuel,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;"
1 Samuel,25,31,"That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid."
1 Samuel,25,32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:"
1 Samuel,25,33,"And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand."
1 Samuel,25,34,"For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall."
1 Samuel,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person."
1 Samuel,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."
1 Samuel,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone."
1 Samuel,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died."
1 Samuel,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife."
1 Samuel,25,40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife."
1 Samuel,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
1 Samuel,25,42,"And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
1 Samuel,25,43,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
1 Samuel,25,44,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim."
1 Samuel,26,1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?"
1 Samuel,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
1 Samuel,26,3,"And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
1 Samuel,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed."
1 Samuel,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him."
1 Samuel,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee."
1 Samuel,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time."
1 Samuel,26,9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?"
1 Samuel,26,10,"David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish."
1 Samuel,26,11,"The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go."
1 Samuel,26,12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them."
1 Samuel,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:"
1 Samuel,26,14,"And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?"
1 Samuel,26,15,"And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord."
1 Samuel,26,16,"This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster."
1 Samuel,26,17,"And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king."
1 Samuel,26,18,"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods."
1 Samuel,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains."
1 Samuel,26,21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
1 Samuel,26,22,"And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed."
1 Samuel,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation."
1 Samuel,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."
1 Samuel,27,1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand."
1 Samuel,27,2,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
1 Samuel,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife."
1 Samuel,27,4,And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
1 Samuel,27,5,"And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"
1 Samuel,27,6,Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
1 Samuel,27,7,And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1 Samuel,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt."
1 Samuel,27,9,"And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish."
1 Samuel,27,10,"And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites."
1 Samuel,27,11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever."
1 Samuel,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men."
1 Samuel,28,2,"And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever."
1 Samuel,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
1 Samuel,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa."
1 Samuel,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
1 Samuel,28,6,"And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."
1 Samuel,28,7,"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor."
1 Samuel,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee."
1 Samuel,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
1 Samuel,28,10,"And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing."
1 Samuel,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel."
1 Samuel,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul."
1 Samuel,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth."
1 Samuel,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself."
1 Samuel,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do."
1 Samuel,28,16,"Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?"
1 Samuel,28,17,"And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:"
1 Samuel,28,18,"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day."
1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel,28,20,"Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
1 Samuel,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me."
1 Samuel,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way."
1 Samuel,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
1 Samuel,28,24,"And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:"
1 Samuel,28,25,"And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
1 Samuel,29,1,Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
1 Samuel,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish."
1 Samuel,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?"
1 Samuel,29,4,"And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?"
1 Samuel,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
1 Samuel,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not."
1 Samuel,29,7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines."
1 Samuel,29,8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
1 Samuel,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle."
1 Samuel,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
1 Samuel,29,11,"So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
1 Samuel,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;"
1 Samuel,30,2,"And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way."
1 Samuel,30,3,"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives."
1 Samuel,30,4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
1 Samuel,30,5,"And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
1 Samuel,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God."
1 Samuel,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David."
1 Samuel,30,8,"And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all."
1 Samuel,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed."
1 Samuel,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor."
1 Samuel,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;"
1 Samuel,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights."
1 Samuel,30,13,"And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick."
1 Samuel,30,14,"We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
1 Samuel,30,15,"And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company."
1 Samuel,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
1 Samuel,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled."
1 Samuel,30,18,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
1 Samuel,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all."
1 Samuel,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil."
1 Samuel,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them."
1 Samuel,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart."
1 Samuel,30,23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand."
1 Samuel,30,24,"For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike."
1 Samuel,30,25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day."
1 Samuel,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;"
1 Samuel,30,27,"To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,"
1 Samuel,30,28,"And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,"
1 Samuel,30,29,"And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,"
1 Samuel,30,30,"And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,"
1 Samuel,30,31,"And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt."
1 Samuel,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons."
1 Samuel,31,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers."
1 Samuel,31,4,"Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him."
1 Samuel,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
1 Samuel,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
1 Samuel,31,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people."
1 Samuel,31,10,And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.
1 Samuel,31,11,And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
1 Samuel,31,12,"All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
1 Samuel,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
2 Samuel,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;"
2 Samuel,1,2,"It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance."
2 Samuel,1,3,"And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped."
2 Samuel,1,4,"And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
2 Samuel,1,5,"And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?"
2 Samuel,1,6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
2 Samuel,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I."
2 Samuel,1,8,"And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite."
2 Samuel,1,9,"He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me."
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord."
2 Samuel,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:"
2 Samuel,1,12,"And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword."
2 Samuel,1,13,"And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."
2 Samuel,1,14,"And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
2 Samuel,1,15,"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died."
2 Samuel,1,16,"And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed."
2 Samuel,1,17,And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
2 Samuel,1,18,"(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)"
2 Samuel,1,19,The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
2 Samuel,1,20,"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
2 Samuel,1,21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil."
2 Samuel,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty."
2 Samuel,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions."
2 Samuel,1,24,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."
2 Samuel,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places."
2 Samuel,1,26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."
2 Samuel,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
2 Samuel,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron."
2 Samuel,2,2,"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite."
2 Samuel,2,3,"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron."
2 Samuel,2,4,"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul."
2 Samuel,2,5,"And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him."
2 Samuel,2,6,"And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing."
2 Samuel,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them."
2 Samuel,2,8,"But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
2 Samuel,2,9,"And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."
2 Samuel,2,11,And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel,2,12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
2 Samuel,2,14,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise."
2 Samuel,2,15,"Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
2 Samuel,2,16,"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,17,"And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
2 Samuel,2,18,"And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe."
2 Samuel,2,19,And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2 Samuel,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am."
2 Samuel,2,21,"And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him."
2 Samuel,2,22,"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?"
2 Samuel,2,23,"Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."
2 Samuel,2,24,"Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?"
2 Samuel,2,27,"And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother."
2 Samuel,2,28,"So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."
2 Samuel,2,29,"And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim."
2 Samuel,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel."
2 Samuel,2,31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died."
2 Samuel,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day."
2 Samuel,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker."
2 Samuel,3,2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
2 Samuel,3,3,"And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;"
2 Samuel,3,4,"And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
2 Samuel,3,5,"And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron."
2 Samuel,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul."
2 Samuel,3,7,"And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?"
2 Samuel,3,8,"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?"
2 Samuel,3,9,"So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;"
2 Samuel,3,10,"To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."
2 Samuel,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him."
2 Samuel,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee."
2 Samuel,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face."
2 Samuel,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
2 Samuel,3,15,"And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish."
2 Samuel,3,16,"And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned."
2 Samuel,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:"
2 Samuel,3,18,"Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies."
2 Samuel,3,19,"And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin."
2 Samuel,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast."
2 Samuel,3,21,"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."
2 Samuel,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."
2 Samuel,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
2 Samuel,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
2 Samuel,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest."
2 Samuel,3,26,"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not."
2 Samuel,3,27,"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother."
2 Samuel,3,28,"And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:"
2 Samuel,3,29,"Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread."
2 Samuel,3,30,"So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
2 Samuel,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier."
2 Samuel,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."
2 Samuel,3,33,"And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?"
2 Samuel,3,34,"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him."
2 Samuel,3,35,"And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down."
2 Samuel,3,36,"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people."
2 Samuel,3,37,For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
2 Samuel,3,38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"
2 Samuel,3,39,"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness."
2 Samuel,4,1,"And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."
2 Samuel,4,2,"And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin."
2 Samuel,4,3,"And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)"
2 Samuel,4,4,"And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."
2 Samuel,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon."
2 Samuel,4,6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
2 Samuel,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night."
2 Samuel,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed."
2 Samuel,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"
2 Samuel,4,10,"When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:"
2 Samuel,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
2 Samuel,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron."
2 Samuel,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel."
2 Samuel,5,3,So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
2 Samuel,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither."
2 Samuel,5,7,Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
2 Samuel,5,8,"And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
2 Samuel,5,9,"So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward."
2 Samuel,5,10,"And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him."
2 Samuel,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house."
2 Samuel,5,12,"And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake."
2 Samuel,5,13,"And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David."
2 Samuel,5,14,"And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,"
2 Samuel,5,15,"Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
2 Samuel,5,16,"And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet."
2 Samuel,5,17,"But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold."
2 Samuel,5,18,The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel,5,19,"And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand."
2 Samuel,5,20,"And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim."
2 Samuel,5,21,"And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them."
2 Samuel,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
2 Samuel,5,23,"And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees."
2 Samuel,5,24,"And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines."
2 Samuel,5,25,"And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer."
2 Samuel,6,1,"Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand."
2 Samuel,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims."
2 Samuel,6,3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart."
2 Samuel,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark."
2 Samuel,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals."
2 Samuel,6,6,"And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it."
2 Samuel,6,7,And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
2 Samuel,6,8,"And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day."
2 Samuel,6,9,"And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?"
2 Samuel,6,10,So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
2 Samuel,6,11,"And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household."
2 Samuel,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness."
2 Samuel,6,13,"And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings."
2 Samuel,6,14,And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
2 Samuel,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet."
2 Samuel,6,16,"And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart."
2 Samuel,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
2 Samuel,6,18,"And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts."
2 Samuel,6,19,"And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house."
2 Samuel,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!"
2 Samuel,6,21,"And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD."
2 Samuel,6,22,"And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour."
2 Samuel,6,23,Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
2 Samuel,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;"
2 Samuel,7,2,"That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains."
2 Samuel,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee."
2 Samuel,7,4,"And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,"
2 Samuel,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle."
2 Samuel,7,7,"In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?"
2 Samuel,7,8,"Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:"
2 Samuel,7,9,"And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth."
2 Samuel,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,"
2 Samuel,7,11,"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house."
2 Samuel,7,12,"And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:"
2 Samuel,7,15,"But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee."
2 Samuel,7,16,And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
2 Samuel,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
2 Samuel,7,18,"Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?"
2 Samuel,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?"
2 Samuel,7,20,"And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant."
2 Samuel,7,21,"For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them."
2 Samuel,7,22,"Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?"
2 Samuel,7,24,"For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said."
2 Samuel,7,26,"And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee."
2 Samuel,7,27,"For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee."
2 Samuel,7,28,"And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:"
2 Samuel,7,29,"Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever."
2 Samuel,8,1,"And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines."
2 Samuel,8,2,"And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates."
2 Samuel,8,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots."
2 Samuel,8,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
2 Samuel,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went."
2 Samuel,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,8,8,"And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass."
2 Samuel,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,"
2 Samuel,8,10,"Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:"
2 Samuel,8,11,"Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;"
2 Samuel,8,12,"Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
2 Samuel,8,13,"And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men."
2 Samuel,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went."
2 Samuel,8,15,And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
2 Samuel,8,16,And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel,8,17,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;"
2 Samuel,8,18,And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.
2 Samuel,9,1,"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
2 Samuel,9,2,"And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he."
2 Samuel,9,3,"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet."
2 Samuel,9,4,"And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar."
2 Samuel,9,5,"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar."
2 Samuel,9,6,"Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!"
2 Samuel,9,7,"And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually."
2 Samuel,9,8,"And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?"
2 Samuel,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house."
2 Samuel,9,10,"Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
2 Samuel,9,11,"Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons."
2 Samuel,9,12,"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth."
2 Samuel,9,13,So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.
2 Samuel,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead."
2 Samuel,10,2,"Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,3,"And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
2 Samuel,10,4,"Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return."
2 Samuel,10,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men."
2 Samuel,10,7,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men."
2 Samuel,10,8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field."
2 Samuel,10,9,"When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:"
2 Samuel,10,10,"And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,11,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good."
2 Samuel,10,13,"And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him."
2 Samuel,10,14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together."
2 Samuel,10,16,"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them."
2 Samuel,10,17,"And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
2 Samuel,10,18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there."
2 Samuel,10,19,"And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more."
2 Samuel,11,1,"And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,11,2,"And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon."
2 Samuel,11,3,"And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
2 Samuel,11,4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house."
2 Samuel,11,5,"And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child."
2 Samuel,11,6,"And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David."
2 Samuel,11,7,"And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered."
2 Samuel,11,8,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,10,"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?"
2 Samuel,11,11,"And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing."
2 Samuel,11,12,"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow."
2 Samuel,11,13,"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah."
2 Samuel,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die."
2 Samuel,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were."
2 Samuel,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
2 Samuel,11,18,Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel,11,19,"And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,"
2 Samuel,11,20,"And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
2 Samuel,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for."
2 Samuel,11,23,"And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate."
2 Samuel,11,24,"And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
2 Samuel,11,25,"Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him."
2 Samuel,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
2 Samuel,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD."
2 Samuel,12,1,"And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
2 Samuel,12,2,The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
2 Samuel,12,3,"But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter."
2 Samuel,12,4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him."
2 Samuel,12,5,"And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
2 Samuel,12,7,"And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;"
2 Samuel,12,8,"And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things."
2 Samuel,12,9,"Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon."
2 Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife."
2 Samuel,12,11,"Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun."
2 Samuel,12,12,"For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."
2 Samuel,12,13,"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die."
2 Samuel,12,14,"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die."
2 Samuel,12,15,"And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick."
2 Samuel,12,16,"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."
2 Samuel,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."
2 Samuel,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread."
2 Samuel,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
2 Samuel,12,24,"And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him."
2 Samuel,12,25,"And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD."
2 Samuel,12,26,"And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
2 Samuel,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance."
2 Samuel,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
2 Samuel,13,2,"And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her."
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man."
2 Samuel,13,4,"And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
2 Samuel,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand."
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand."
2 Samuel,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat."
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."
2 Samuel,13,9,"And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."
2 Samuel,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother."
2 Samuel,13,11,"And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister."
2 Samuel,13,12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly."
2 Samuel,13,13,"And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee."
2 Samuel,13,14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone."
2 Samuel,13,16,"And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her."
2 Samuel,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."
2 Samuel,13,18,"And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."
2 Samuel,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying."
2 Samuel,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house."
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth."
2 Samuel,13,22,"And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons."
2 Samuel,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant."
2 Samuel,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him."
2 Samuel,13,28,"Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant."
2 Samuel,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled."
2 Samuel,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left."
2 Samuel,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent."
2 Samuel,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead."
2 Samuel,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him."
2 Samuel,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is."
2 Samuel,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore."
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day."
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:"
2 Samuel,14,3,"And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth."
2 Samuel,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king."
2 Samuel,14,5,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead."
2 Samuel,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him."
2 Samuel,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth."
2 Samuel,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee."
2 Samuel,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless."
2 Samuel,14,10,"And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more."
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth."
2 Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on."
2 Samuel,14,13,"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him."
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid."
2 Samuel,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God."
2 Samuel,14,17,"Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee."
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
2 Samuel,14,19,"And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:"
2 Samuel,14,20,"To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."
2 Samuel,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again."
2 Samuel,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant."
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face."
2 Samuel,14,25,But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel,14,26,"And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight."
2 Samuel,14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance."
2 Samuel,14,28,"So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face."
2 Samuel,14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
2 Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire."
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?"
2 Samuel,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me."
2 Samuel,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
2 Samuel,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."
2 Samuel,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee."
2 Samuel,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"
2 Samuel,15,5,"And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him."
2 Samuel,15,6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,7,"And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD."
2 Samuel,15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing."
2 Samuel,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."
2 Samuel,15,15,"And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint."
2 Samuel,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house."
2 Samuel,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."
2 Samuel,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
2 Samuel,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile."
2 Samuel,15,20,"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee."
2 Samuel,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be."
2 Samuel,15,22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city."
2 Samuel,15,25,"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:"
2 Samuel,15,26,"But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him."
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
2 Samuel,15,28,"See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me."
2 Samuel,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
2 Samuel,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
2 Samuel,15,31,"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
2 Samuel,15,32,"And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:"
2 Samuel,15,33,"Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:"
2 Samuel,15,34,"But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel."
2 Samuel,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear."
2 Samuel,15,37,"So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink."
2 Samuel,16,3,"And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father."
2 Samuel,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king."
2 Samuel,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came."
2 Samuel,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."
2 Samuel,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:"
2 Samuel,16,8,"The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man."
2 Samuel,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head."
2 Samuel,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?"
2 Samuel,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him."
2 Samuel,16,12,"It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day."
2 Samuel,16,13,"And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."
2 Samuel,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there."
2 Samuel,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king."
2 Samuel,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?"
2 Samuel,16,18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide."
2 Samuel,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence."
2 Samuel,16,20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do."
2 Samuel,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong."
2 Samuel,16,22,So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2 Samuel,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:"
2 Samuel,17,2,"And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:"
2 Samuel,17,3,And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
2 Samuel,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith."
2 Samuel,17,6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou."
2 Samuel,17,7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time."
2 Samuel,17,8,"For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
2 Samuel,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,10,"And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men."
2 Samuel,17,11,"Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person."
2 Samuel,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one."
2 Samuel,17,13,"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."
2 Samuel,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,15,"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him."
2 Samuel,17,17,Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
2 Samuel,17,18,"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down."
2 Samuel,17,19,"And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known."
2 Samuel,17,20,"And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you."
2 Samuel,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan."
2 Samuel,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother."
2 Samuel,17,26,So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
2 Samuel,17,28,"Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,"
2 Samuel,17,29,"And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
2 Samuel,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them."
2 Samuel,18,2,"And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city."
2 Samuel,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
2 Samuel,18,7,"Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men."
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2 Samuel,18,9,"And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away."
2 Samuel,18,10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak."
2 Samuel,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle."
2 Samuel,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,13,"Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me."
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak."
2 Samuel,18,15,"And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people."
2 Samuel,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent."
