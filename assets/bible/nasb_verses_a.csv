Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters."
Genesis,1,3,"Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light."
Genesis,1,4,God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis,1,5,"God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day."
Genesis,1,6,"Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”"
Genesis,1,7,"God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so."
Genesis,1,8,"God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day."
Genesis,1,9,"Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,10,"God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"Then God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,12,"The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,13,"There was evening and there was morning, a third day."
Genesis,1,14,"Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years;"
Genesis,1,15,and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so.
Genesis,1,16,"God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also."
Genesis,1,17,"God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,19,"There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day."
Genesis,1,20,"Then God said, “Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.”"
Genesis,1,21,"God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,22,"God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,23,"There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
Genesis,1,24,"Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,27,"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them."
Genesis,1,28,"God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,29,"Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;"
Genesis,1,30,"and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,31,"God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts."
Genesis,2,2,"By the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done."
Genesis,2,3,"Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made."
Genesis,2,4,"This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven."
Genesis,2,5,"Now no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground."
Genesis,2,6,But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
Genesis,2,7,"Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."
Genesis,2,8,"The LORD God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man whom He had formed."
Genesis,2,9,"Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers.
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold."
Genesis,2,12,The gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
Genesis,2,13,The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis,2,14,The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis,2,15,Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.
Genesis,2,16,"The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely;"
Genesis,2,17,"but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”"
Genesis,2,18,"Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.”"
Genesis,2,19,"Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name."
Genesis,2,20,"The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him."
Genesis,2,21,"So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place."
Genesis,2,22,"The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man."
Genesis,2,23,"The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.”"
Genesis,2,24,"For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;"
Genesis,3,3,"but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’”"
Genesis,3,4,"The serpent said to the woman, “You surely will not die!"
Genesis,3,5,"For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”"
Genesis,3,6,"When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
Genesis,3,7,"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings."
Genesis,3,8,"They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,9,"Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"He said, “I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”"
Genesis,3,11,"And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”"
Genesis,3,12,"The man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,13,"Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,14,"The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life;"
Genesis,3,15,"And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel.”"
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you.”"
Genesis,3,17,"Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of your life."
Genesis,3,18,“Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field;
Genesis,3,19,"By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall return.”"
Genesis,3,20,"Now the man called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all the living."
Genesis,3,21,"The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them."
Genesis,3,22,"Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever”—"
Genesis,3,23,"therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken."
Genesis,3,24,So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.
Genesis,4,1,"Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have gotten a manchild with the help of the LORD.”"
Genesis,4,2,"Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
Genesis,4,3,So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground.
Genesis,4,4,"Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering;"
Genesis,4,5,but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.
Genesis,4,6,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?"
Genesis,4,7,"If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it.”"
Genesis,4,8,"Cain told Abel his brother. And it came about when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”"
Genesis,4,10,"He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,"Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand."
Genesis,4,12,"When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth.”"
Genesis,4,13,"Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is too great to bear!"
Genesis,4,14,"Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,"So the LORD said to him, “Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, so that no one finding him would slay him."
Genesis,4,16,"Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city Enoch, after the name of his son."
Genesis,4,18,"Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael became the father of Methushael, and Methushael became the father of Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"Lamech took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
Genesis,4,21,His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
Genesis,4,22,"As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah."
Genesis,4,23,"Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, Listen to my voice, You wives of Lamech, Give heed to my speech, For I have killed a man for wounding me; And a boy for striking me;"
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”"
Genesis,4,25,"Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, she said, “God has appointed me another offspring in place of Abel, for Cain killed him.”"
Genesis,4,26,"To Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD."
Genesis,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God."
Genesis,5,2,"He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created."
Genesis,5,3,"When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth."
Genesis,5,4,"Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,5,"So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died."
Genesis,5,6,"Seth lived one hundred and five years, and became the father of Enosh."
Genesis,5,7,"Then Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after he became the father of Enosh, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,8,"So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died."
Genesis,5,9,"Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan."
Genesis,5,10,"Then Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he became the father of Kenan, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,11,"So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died."
Genesis,5,12,"Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel."
Genesis,5,13,"Then Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he became the father of Mahalalel, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,14,"So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died."
Genesis,5,15,"Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared."
Genesis,5,16,"Then Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Jared, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,17,"So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died."
Genesis,5,18,"Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch."
Genesis,5,19,"Then Jared lived eight hundred years after he became the father of Enoch, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,20,"So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died."
Genesis,5,21,"Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah."
Genesis,5,22,"Then Enoch walked with God three hundred years after he became the father of Methuselah, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,23,So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
Genesis,5,24,"Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him."
Genesis,5,25,"Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech."
Genesis,5,26,"Then Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after he became the father of Lamech, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,27,"So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died."
Genesis,5,28,"Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of a son."
Genesis,5,29,"Now he called his name Noah, saying, “This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands arising from the ground which the LORD has cursed.”"
Genesis,5,30,"Then Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years after he became the father of Noah, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,31,"So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died."
Genesis,5,32,"Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,1,"Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them,"
Genesis,6,2,"that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose."
Genesis,6,3,"Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”"
Genesis,6,4,"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown."
Genesis,6,5,"Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
Genesis,6,6,"The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart."
Genesis,6,7,"The LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.”"
Genesis,6,8,But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis,6,9,"These are the records of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God."
Genesis,6,10,"Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,11,"Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence."
Genesis,6,12,"God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth."
Genesis,6,13,"Then God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth."
Genesis,6,14,"Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch."
Genesis,6,15,"This is how you shall make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits."
Genesis,6,16,"You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks."
Genesis,6,17,"Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish."
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female."
Genesis,6,20,"Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every kind will come to you to keep them alive."
Genesis,6,21,"As for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be for food for you and for them.”"
Genesis,6,22,"Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did."
Genesis,7,1,"Then the LORD said to Noah, “Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this time."
Genesis,7,2,"You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female;"
Genesis,7,3,"also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth."
Genesis,7,4,"For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made.”"
Genesis,7,5,Noah did according to all that the LORD had commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth.
Genesis,7,7,Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood.
Genesis,7,8,"Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground,"
Genesis,7,9,"there went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah."
Genesis,7,10,"It came about after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth."
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the sky were opened."
Genesis,7,12,The rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,"On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark,"
Genesis,7,14,"they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, all sorts of birds."
Genesis,7,15,"So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life."
Genesis,7,16,"Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed it behind him."
Genesis,7,17,"Then the flood came upon the earth for forty days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth."
Genesis,7,18,"The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water."
Genesis,7,19,"The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered."
Genesis,7,20,"The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered."
Genesis,7,21,"All flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind;"
Genesis,7,22,"of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died."
Genesis,7,23,"Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark."
Genesis,7,24,The water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
Genesis,8,1,"But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided."
Genesis,8,2,"Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained;"
Genesis,8,3,"and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased."
Genesis,8,4,"In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis,8,5,"The water decreased steadily until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible."
Genesis,8,6,"Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made;"
Genesis,8,7,"and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth."
Genesis,8,8,"Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land;"
Genesis,8,9,"but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark, for the water was on the surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself."
Genesis,8,10,So he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark.
Genesis,8,11,"The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth."
Genesis,8,12,"Then he waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again."
Genesis,8,13,"Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the water was dried up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried up."
Genesis,8,14,"In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry."
Genesis,8,15,"Then God spoke to Noah, saying,"
Genesis,8,16,"“Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,8,18,"So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him."
Genesis,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark."
Genesis,8,20,"Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
Genesis,8,21,"The LORD smelled the soothing aroma; and the LORD said to Himself, “I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the intent of man’s heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"“While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, And cold and heat, And summer and winter, And day and night Shall not cease.”"
Genesis,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given."
Genesis,9,3,"Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green plant."
Genesis,9,4,"Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."
Genesis,9,5,"Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man’s brother I will require the life of man."
Genesis,9,6,"“Whoever sheds man’s blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man."
Genesis,9,7,"“As for you, be fruitful and multiply; Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.”"
Genesis,9,8,"Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,"
Genesis,9,9,"“Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you;"
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth."
Genesis,9,11,"I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth.”"
Genesis,9,12,"God said, “This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations;"
Genesis,9,13,"I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud,"
Genesis,9,15,"and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh."
Genesis,9,16,"When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,17,"And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,18,Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.
Genesis,9,19,"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated."
Genesis,9,20,Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard.
Genesis,9,21,"He drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent."
Genesis,9,22,"Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside."
Genesis,9,23,"But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father’s nakedness."
Genesis,9,24,"When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him."
Genesis,9,25,"So he said, “Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers.”"
Genesis,9,26,"He also said, “Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
Genesis,9,27,"“May God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.”"
Genesis,9,28,Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.
Genesis,9,29,"So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died."
Genesis,10,1,"Now these are the records of the generations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and sons were born to them after the flood."
Genesis,10,2,The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.
Genesis,10,3,The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
Genesis,10,4,"The sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim."
Genesis,10,5,"From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations."
Genesis,10,6,The sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.
Genesis,10,7,The sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
Genesis,10,8,Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth.
Genesis,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.”"
Genesis,10,10,"The beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
Genesis,10,11,"From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah,"
Genesis,10,12,and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
Genesis,10,13,Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim
Genesis,10,14,and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
Genesis,10,15,"Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth"
Genesis,10,16,and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite
Genesis,10,17,and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite
Genesis,10,18,and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.
Genesis,10,19,"The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha."
Genesis,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations."
Genesis,10,21,"Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the older brother of Japheth, children were born."
Genesis,10,22,The sons of Shem were Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
Genesis,10,23,The sons of Aram were Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
Genesis,10,24,Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
Genesis,10,25,"Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan."
Genesis,10,26,Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
Genesis,10,27,and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
Genesis,10,28,and Obal and Abimael and Sheba
Genesis,10,29,and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis,10,30,"Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east."
Genesis,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations."
Genesis,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood."
Genesis,11,1,Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
Genesis,11,2,"It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there."
Genesis,11,3,"They said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.” And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar."
Genesis,11,4,"They said, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”"
Genesis,11,5,The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
Genesis,11,6,"The LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them."
Genesis,11,7,"Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”"
Genesis,11,8,So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.
Genesis,11,9,"Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth."
Genesis,11,10,"These are the records of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old, and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;"
Genesis,11,11,"and Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,12,"Arpachshad lived thirty-five years, and became the father of Shelah;"
Genesis,11,13,"and Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Shelah, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,14,"Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber;"
Genesis,11,15,"and Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,16,"Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg;"
Genesis,11,17,"and Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,18,"Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu;"
Genesis,11,19,"and Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he became the father of Reu, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,20,"Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug;"
Genesis,11,21,"and Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he became the father of Serug, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,22,"Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor;"
Genesis,11,23,"and Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,24,"Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah;"
Genesis,11,25,"and Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and he had other sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,26,"Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran."
Genesis,11,27,"Now these are the records of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
Genesis,11,29,"Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah."
Genesis,11,30,Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Genesis,11,31,"Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans in order to enter the land of Canaan; and they went as far as Haran, and settled there."
Genesis,11,32,The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis,12,1,"Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father’s house, To the land which I will show you;"
Genesis,12,2,"And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing;"
Genesis,12,3,"And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”"
Genesis,12,4,So Abram went forth as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
Genesis,12,5,"Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan; thus they came to the land of Canaan."
Genesis,12,6,"Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanite was then in the land."
Genesis,12,7,"The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him."
Genesis,12,8,"Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD."
Genesis,12,9,"Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev."
Genesis,12,10,"Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land."
Genesis,12,11,"It came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman;"
Genesis,12,12,"and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me, but they will let you live."
Genesis,12,13,"Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you.”"
Genesis,12,14,"It came about when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful."
Genesis,12,15,Pharaoh’s officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis,12,16,Therefore he treated Abram well for her sake; and gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels.
Genesis,12,17,"But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife."
Genesis,12,18,"Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?"
Genesis,12,19,"Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her and go.”"
Genesis,12,20,"Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they escorted him away, with his wife and all that belonged to him."
Genesis,13,1,"So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him, and Lot with him."
Genesis,13,2,"Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold."
Genesis,13,3,"He went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,"
Genesis,13,4,to the place of the altar which he had made there formerly; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents."
Genesis,13,6,"And the land could not sustain them while dwelling together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together."
Genesis,13,7,And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
Genesis,13,8,"So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers."
Genesis,13,9,"Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if to the left, then I will go to the right; or if to the right, then I will go to the left.”"
Genesis,13,10,"Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere—this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go to Zoar."
Genesis,13,11,"So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they separated from each other."
Genesis,13,12,"Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the valley, and moved his tents as far as Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the LORD.
Genesis,13,14,"The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;"
Genesis,13,15,"for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever."
Genesis,13,16,"I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants can also be numbered."
Genesis,13,17,"Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you.”"
Genesis,13,18,"Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD."
Genesis,14,1,"And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,"
Genesis,14,2,"that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)."
Genesis,14,3,"All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea)."
Genesis,14,4,"Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but the thirteenth year they rebelled."
Genesis,14,5,"In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,"
Genesis,14,6,"and the Horites in their Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness."
Genesis,14,7,"Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and conquered all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-tamar."
Genesis,14,8,"And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim,"
Genesis,14,9,against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
Genesis,14,10,"Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell into them. But those who survived fled to the hill country."
Genesis,14,11,"Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply, and departed."
Genesis,14,12,"They also took Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions and departed, for he was living in Sodom."
Genesis,14,13,"Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were allies with Abram."
Genesis,14,14,"When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan."
Genesis,14,15,"He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, and also the women, and the people."
Genesis,14,17,"Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley)."
Genesis,14,18,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High.
Genesis,14,19,"He blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;"
Genesis,14,20,"And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” He gave him a tenth of all."
Genesis,14,21,"The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself.”"
Genesis,14,22,"Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,23,"that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, for fear you would say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’"
Genesis,14,24,"I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share.”"
Genesis,15,1,"After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great.”"
Genesis,15,2,"Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”"
Genesis,15,3,"And Abram said, “Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.”"
Genesis,15,4,"Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”"
Genesis,15,5,"And He took him outside and said, “Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”"
Genesis,15,6,Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.
Genesis,15,7,"And He said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it.”"
Genesis,15,8,"He said, “O Lord GOD, how may I know that I will possess it?”"
Genesis,15,9,"So He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,"Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds."
Genesis,15,11,"The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away."
Genesis,15,12,"Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him."
Genesis,15,13,"God said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years."
Genesis,15,14,"But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions."
Genesis,15,15,"As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age."
Genesis,15,16,"Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.”"
Genesis,15,17,"It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces."
Genesis,15,18,"On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:"
Genesis,15,19,the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
Genesis,15,20,and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
Genesis,15,21,and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.”
Genesis,16,1,"Now Sarai, Abram’s wife had borne him no children, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar."
Genesis,16,2,"So Sarai said to Abram, “Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai."
Genesis,16,3,"After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife."
Genesis,16,4,"He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her sight."
Genesis,16,5,"And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the LORD judge between you and me.”"
Genesis,16,6,"But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight.” So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence."
Genesis,16,7,"Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur."
Genesis,16,8,"He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from and where are you going?” And she said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”"
Genesis,16,9,"Then the angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority.”"
Genesis,16,10,"Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, “I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.”"
Genesis,16,11,"The angel of the LORD said to her further, “Behold, you are with child, And you will bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has given heed to your affliction."
Genesis,16,12,"“He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be against everyone, And everyone’s hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers.”"
Genesis,16,13,"Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees”; for she said, “Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?”"
Genesis,16,14,"Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
Genesis,16,15,"So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael."
Genesis,16,16,Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
Genesis,17,1,"Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless."
Genesis,17,2,"“I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly.”"
Genesis,17,3,"Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,"
Genesis,17,4,"“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations."
Genesis,17,5,"“No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations."
Genesis,17,6,"I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you."
Genesis,17,7,"I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you."
Genesis,17,8,"I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”"
Genesis,17,9,"God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations."
Genesis,17,10,"This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised."
Genesis,17,11,"And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you."
Genesis,17,12,"And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a servant who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants."
Genesis,17,13,A servant who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis,17,14,"But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”"
Genesis,17,15,"Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name."
Genesis,17,16,"I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”"
Genesis,17,17,"Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”"
Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!”"
Genesis,17,19,"But God said, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him."
Genesis,17,20,"As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation."
Genesis,17,21,"But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.”"
Genesis,17,22,"When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham."
Genesis,17,23,"Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all the servants who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had said to him."
Genesis,17,24,Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis,17,25,And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis,17,26,"In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
Genesis,17,27,"All the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
Genesis,18,1,"Now the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day."
Genesis,18,2,"When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth,"
Genesis,18,3,"and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by."
Genesis,18,4,"Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree;"
Genesis,18,5,"and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do, as you have said.”"
Genesis,18,6,"So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it and make bread cakes.”"
Genesis,18,7,"Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it."
Genesis,18,8,"He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed it before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate."
Genesis,18,9,"Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “There, in the tent.”"
Genesis,18,10,"He said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him."
Genesis,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing."
Genesis,18,12,"Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”"
Genesis,18,13,"And the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am so old?’"
Genesis,18,14,"Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”"
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah denied it however, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. And He said, “No, but you did laugh.”"
Genesis,18,16,"Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off."
Genesis,18,17,"The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,"
Genesis,18,18,"since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed?"
Genesis,18,19,"For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.”"
Genesis,18,20,"And the LORD said, “The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave."
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down now, and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know.”"
Genesis,18,22,"Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD."
Genesis,18,23,"Abraham came near and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?"
Genesis,18,24,Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?
Genesis,18,25,"Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”"
Genesis,18,26,"So the LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account.”"
Genesis,18,27,"And Abraham replied, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes."
Genesis,18,28,"Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five?” And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”"
Genesis,18,29,"He spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it on account of the forty.”"
Genesis,18,30,"Then he said, “Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”"
Genesis,18,31,"And he said, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the twenty.”"
Genesis,18,32,"Then he said, “Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the ten.”"
Genesis,18,33,"As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place."
Genesis,19,1,"Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground."
Genesis,19,2,"And he said, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said however, “No, but we shall spend the night in the square.”"
Genesis,19,3,"Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;"
Genesis,19,5,"and they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.”"
Genesis,19,6,"But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,"
Genesis,19,7,"and said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly."
Genesis,19,8,"Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof.”"
Genesis,19,9,"But they said, “Stand aside.” Furthermore, they said, “This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them.” So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door."
Genesis,19,10,"But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door."
Genesis,19,11,"They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway."
Genesis,19,12,"Then the two men said to Lot, “Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place;"
Genesis,19,13,"for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”"
Genesis,19,14,"Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, “Up, get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city.” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting."
Genesis,19,15,"When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.”"
Genesis,19,16,"But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city."
Genesis,19,17,"When they had brought them outside, one said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.”"
Genesis,19,18,"But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lords!"
Genesis,19,19,"Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die;"
Genesis,19,20,"now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) that my life may be saved.”"
Genesis,19,21,"He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken."
Genesis,19,22,"Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar."
Genesis,19,23,The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,"Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven,"
Genesis,19,25,"and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground."
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis,19,27,Now Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD;
Genesis,19,28,"and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"Thus it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived."
Genesis,19,30,"Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters."
Genesis,19,31,"Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth."
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father.”"
Genesis,19,33,"So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose."
Genesis,19,34,"On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father.”"
Genesis,19,35,"So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose."
Genesis,19,36,Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
Genesis,19,37,"The firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day."
Genesis,19,38,"As for the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day."
Genesis,20,1,"Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar."
Genesis,20,2,"Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah."
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married.”"
Genesis,20,4,"Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You slay a nation, even though blameless?"
Genesis,20,5,"Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”"
Genesis,20,6,"Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore, restore the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.”"
Genesis,20,8,So Abimelech arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened.
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.”"
Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?”"
Genesis,20,11,"Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife."
Genesis,20,12,"Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife;"
Genesis,20,13,"and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, ‘This is the kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”"
Genesis,20,14,"Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him."
Genesis,20,15,"Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.”"
Genesis,20,16,"To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are cleared.”"
Genesis,20,17,"Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore children."
Genesis,20,18,"For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife."
Genesis,21,1,"Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised."
Genesis,21,2,"So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him."
Genesis,21,3,"Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
Genesis,21,4,"Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis,21,6,"Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.”"
Genesis,21,7,"And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”"
Genesis,21,8,"The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned."
Genesis,21,9,"Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
Genesis,21,10,"Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.”"
Genesis,21,11,The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son.
Genesis,21,12,"But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named."
Genesis,21,13,"And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”"
Genesis,21,14,"So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba."
Genesis,21,15,"When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes."
Genesis,21,16,"Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “Do not let me see the boy die.” And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept."
Genesis,21,17,"God heard the lad crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is."
Genesis,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.”"
Genesis,21,19,Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.
Genesis,21,20,"God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer."
Genesis,21,21,"He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt."
Genesis,21,22,"Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do;"
Genesis,21,23,"now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.”"
Genesis,21,24,"Abraham said, “I swear it.”"
Genesis,21,25,But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized.
Genesis,21,26,"And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today.”"
Genesis,21,27,"Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant."
Genesis,21,28,Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis,21,29,"Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?”"
Genesis,21,30,"He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well.”"
Genesis,21,31,"Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath."
Genesis,21,32,"So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God."
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
Genesis,22,1,"Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,22,2,"He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.”"
Genesis,22,3,"So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him."
Genesis,22,4,On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
Genesis,22,5,"Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.”"
Genesis,22,6,"Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together."
Genesis,22,7,"Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”"
Genesis,22,8,"Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together."
Genesis,22,9,"Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood."
Genesis,22,10,Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis,22,11,"But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,22,12,"He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”"
Genesis,22,13,"Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son."
Genesis,22,14,"Abraham called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, “In the mount of the LORD it will be provided.”"
Genesis,22,15,"Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,"
Genesis,22,16,"and said, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,"
Genesis,22,17,"indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies."
Genesis,22,18,"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.”"
Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba."
Genesis,22,20,"Now it came about after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:"
Genesis,22,21,Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram
Genesis,22,22,and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.”
Genesis,22,23,"Bethuel became the father of Rebekah; these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother."
Genesis,22,24,"His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah."
Genesis,23,1,Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis,23,2,"Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her."
Genesis,23,3,"Then Abraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,"
Genesis,23,4,“I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
Genesis,23,5,"The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
Genesis,23,6,"“Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead.”"
Genesis,23,7,"So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth."
Genesis,23,8,"And he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your wish for me to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and approach Ephron the son of Zohar for me,"
Genesis,23,9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site.”"
Genesis,23,10,"Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth; even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
Genesis,23,11,"“No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,12,And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.
Genesis,23,13,"He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept it from me that I may bury my dead there.”"
Genesis,23,14,"Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
Genesis,23,15,"“My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,16,"Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard."
Genesis,23,17,"So Ephron’s field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over"
Genesis,23,18,"to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city."
Genesis,23,19,"After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,23,20,"So the field and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth."
Genesis,24,1,"Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way."
Genesis,24,2,"Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, “Please place your hand under my thigh,"
Genesis,24,3,"and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,"
Genesis,24,4,"but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”"
Genesis,24,5,"The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?”"
Genesis,24,6,"Then Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there!"
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give this land,’ He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there."
Genesis,24,8,"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath; only do not take my son back there.”"
Genesis,24,9,"So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter."
Genesis,24,10,"Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
Genesis,24,11,"He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water."
Genesis,24,12,"He said, “O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,"Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;"
Genesis,24,14,"now may it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and who answers, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’—may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac; and by this I will know that You have shown lovingkindness to my master.”"
Genesis,24,15,"Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder."
Genesis,24,16,"The girl was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had had relations with her; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up."
Genesis,24,17,"Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”"
Genesis,24,18,"She said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink."
Genesis,24,19,"Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking.”"
Genesis,24,20,"So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels."
Genesis,24,21,"Meanwhile, the man was gazing at her in silence, to know whether the LORD had made his journey successful or not."
Genesis,24,22,"When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold,"
Genesis,24,23,"and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to lodge in your father’s house?”"
Genesis,24,24,"She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”"
Genesis,24,25,"Again she said to him, “We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to lodge in.”"
Genesis,24,26,Then the man bowed low and worshiped the LORD.
Genesis,24,27,"He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His truth toward my master; as for me, the LORD has guided me in the way to the house of my master’s brothers.”"
Genesis,24,28,Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
Genesis,24,29,Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring.
Genesis,24,30,"When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring."
Genesis,24,31,"And he said, “Come in, blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?”"
Genesis,24,32,"So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him."
Genesis,24,33,"But when food was set before him to eat, he said, “I will not eat until I have told my business.” And he said, “Speak on.”"
Genesis,24,34,"So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant."
Genesis,24,35,"The LORD has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,24,36,"Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has."
Genesis,24,37,"My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;"
Genesis,24,38,"but you shall go to my father’s house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’"
Genesis,24,39,"I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman does not follow me.’"
Genesis,24,40,"He said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house;"
Genesis,24,41,"then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’"
Genesis,24,42,"“So I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now You will make my journey on which I go successful;"
Genesis,24,43,"behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar”;"
Genesis,24,44,"and she will say to me, “You drink, and I will draw for your camels also”; let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’"
Genesis,24,45,"“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’"
Genesis,24,46,"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’; so I drank, and she watered the camels also."
Genesis,24,47,"Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him’; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists."
Genesis,24,48,"And I bowed low and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son."
Genesis,24,49,"So now if you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left.”"
Genesis,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The matter comes from the LORD; so we cannot speak to you bad or good."
Genesis,24,51,"Here is Rebekah before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has spoken.”"
Genesis,24,52,"When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD."
Genesis,24,53,"The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother."
Genesis,24,54,"Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me away to my master.”"
Genesis,24,55,"But her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days, say ten; afterward she may go.”"
Genesis,24,56,"He said to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”"
Genesis,24,57,"And they said, “We will call the girl and consult her wishes.”"
Genesis,24,58,"Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”"
Genesis,24,59,Thus they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men.
Genesis,24,60,"They blessed Rebekah and said to her, “May you, our sister, Become thousands of ten thousands, And may your descendants possess The gate of those who hate them.”"
Genesis,24,61,"Then Rebekah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed."
Genesis,24,62,Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev.
Genesis,24,63,"Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming."
Genesis,24,64,"Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel."
Genesis,24,65,"She said to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “He is my master.” Then she took her veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis,24,67,"Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."
Genesis,25,1,"Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah."
Genesis,25,2,She bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.
Genesis,25,3,Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.
Genesis,25,4,The sons of Midian were Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
Genesis,25,5,Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac;
Genesis,25,6,"but to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the east."
Genesis,25,7,"These are all the years of Abraham’s life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years."
Genesis,25,8,"Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man and satisfied with life; and he was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,9,"Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre,"
Genesis,25,10,the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.
Genesis,25,11,"It came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi."
Genesis,25,12,"Now these are the records of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maid, bore to Abraham;"
Genesis,25,13,"and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam"
Genesis,25,14,"and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah."
Genesis,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve princes according to their tribes."
Genesis,25,17,"These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,18,They settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he settled in defiance of all his relatives.
Genesis,25,19,"Now these are the records of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham became the father of Isaac;"
Genesis,25,20,"and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife."
Genesis,25,21,"Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD answered him and Rebekah his wife conceived."
Genesis,25,22,"But the children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is so, why then am I this way?” So she went to inquire of the LORD."
Genesis,25,23,"The LORD said to her, “Two nations are in your womb; And two peoples will be separated from your body; And one people shall be stronger than the other; And the older shall serve the younger.”"
Genesis,25,24,"When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,"Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau."
Genesis,25,26,"Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them."
Genesis,25,27,"When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a peaceful man, living in tents."
Genesis,25,28,"Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
Genesis,25,29,"When Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished;"
Genesis,25,30,"and Esau said to Jacob, “Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom."
Genesis,25,31,"But Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.”"
Genesis,25,32,"Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die; so of what use then is the birthright to me?”"
Genesis,25,33,"And Jacob said, “First swear to me”; so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob."
Genesis,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright."
Genesis,26,1,"Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines."
Genesis,26,2,"The LORD appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you."
Genesis,26,3,"Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you, for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham."
Genesis,26,4,"I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;"
Genesis,26,5,"because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws.”"
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac lived in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,"When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “my wife,” thinking, “the men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful.”"
Genesis,26,8,"It came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing his wife Rebekah."
Genesis,26,9,"Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Behold, certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘I might die on account of her.’”"
Genesis,26,10,"Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”"
Genesis,26,11,"So Abimelech charged all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”"
Genesis,26,12,"Now Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him,"
Genesis,26,13,"and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy;"
Genesis,26,14,"for he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him."
Genesis,26,15,"Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth."
Genesis,26,16,"Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us.”"
Genesis,26,17,"And Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there."
Genesis,26,18,"Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them."
Genesis,26,19,"But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water,"
Genesis,26,20,"the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him."
Genesis,26,21,"Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah."
Genesis,26,22,"He moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth, for he said, “At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”"
Genesis,26,23,Then he went up from there to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,"The LORD appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham; Do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, For the sake of My servant Abraham.”"
Genesis,26,25,"So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well."
Genesis,26,26,Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and Phicol the commander of his army.
Genesis,26,27,"Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?”"
Genesis,26,28,"They said, “We see plainly that the LORD has been with you; so we said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,"
Genesis,26,29,"that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.’”"
Genesis,26,30,"Then he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,In the morning they arose early and exchanged oaths; then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis,26,32,"Now it came about on the same day, that Isaac’s servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”"
Genesis,26,33,So he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;"
Genesis,26,35,and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"Now it came about, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,27,2,"Isaac said, “Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death."
Genesis,27,3,"Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me;"
Genesis,27,4,"and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.”"
Genesis,27,5,"Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring home,"
Genesis,27,6,"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying,"
Genesis,27,7,"‘Bring me some game and prepare a savory dish for me, that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.’"
Genesis,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you."
Genesis,27,9,"Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there, that I may prepare them as a savory dish for your father, such as he loves."
Genesis,27,10,"Then you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”"
Genesis,27,11,"Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man."
Genesis,27,12,"Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.”"
Genesis,27,13,"But his mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.”"
Genesis,27,14,"So he went and got them, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savory food such as his father loved."
Genesis,27,15,"Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son."
Genesis,27,16,And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,"She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Jacob."
Genesis,27,18,"Then he came to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”"
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Get up, please, sit and eat of my game, that you may bless me.”"
Genesis,27,20,"Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the LORD your God caused it to happen to me.”"
Genesis,27,21,"Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come close, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”"
Genesis,27,22,"So Jacob came close to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”"
Genesis,27,23,"He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him."
Genesis,27,24,"And he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he said, “I am.”"
Genesis,27,25,"So he said, “Bring it to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, that I may bless you.” And he brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come close and kiss me, my son.”"
Genesis,27,27,"So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, “See, the smell of my son Is like the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed;"
Genesis,27,28,"Now may God give you of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And an abundance of grain and new wine;"
Genesis,27,29,"May peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you; Be master of your brothers, And may your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, And blessed be those who bless you.”"
Genesis,27,30,"Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"Then he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.”"
Genesis,27,32,"Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”"
Genesis,27,33,"Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who was he then that hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate of all of it before you came, and blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.”"
Genesis,27,34,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!”"
Genesis,27,35,"And he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,36,"Then he said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”"
Genesis,27,37,"But Isaac replied to Esau, “Behold, I have made him your master, and all his relatives I have given to him as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. Now as for you then, what can I do, my son?”"
Genesis,27,38,"Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” So Esau lifted his voice and wept."
Genesis,27,39,"Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, “Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling, And away from the dew of heaven from above."
Genesis,27,40,"“By your sword you shall live, And your brother you shall serve; But it shall come about when you become restless, That you will break his yoke from your neck.”"
Genesis,27,41,"So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”"
Genesis,27,42,"Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, “Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you."
Genesis,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban!"
Genesis,27,44,"Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides,"
Genesis,27,45,until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”
Genesis,27,46,"Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”"
Genesis,28,1,"So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan."
Genesis,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother."
Genesis,28,3,"May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples."
Genesis,28,4,"May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.”"
Genesis,28,5,"Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau."
Genesis,28,6,"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he charged him, saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,”"
Genesis,28,7,and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram.
Genesis,28,8,So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased his father Isaac;
Genesis,28,9,"and Esau went to Ishmael, and married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth."
Genesis,28,10,Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
Genesis,28,11,"He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place."
Genesis,28,12,"He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it."
Genesis,28,13,"And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants."
Genesis,28,14,"Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
Genesis,28,15,"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”"
Genesis,28,16,"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.”"
Genesis,28,17,"He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”"
Genesis,28,18,"So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top."
Genesis,28,19,"He called the name of that place Bethel; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz."
Genesis,28,20,"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear,"
Genesis,28,21,"and I return to my father’s house in safety, then the LORD will be my God."
Genesis,28,22,"This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.”"
Genesis,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east."
Genesis,29,2,"He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large."
Genesis,29,3,"When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.”"
Genesis,29,5,"He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.”"
Genesis,29,6,"And he said to them, “Is it well with him?” And they said, “It is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,7,"He said, “Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them.”"
Genesis,29,8,"But they said, “We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,9,"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
Genesis,29,10,"When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother."
Genesis,29,11,"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted his voice and wept."
Genesis,29,12,"Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, and she ran and told her father."
Genesis,29,13,"So when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he related to Laban all these things."
Genesis,29,14,"Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him a month."
Genesis,29,15,"Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”"
Genesis,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,"And Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of form and face."
Genesis,29,18,"Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”"
Genesis,29,19,"Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me.”"
Genesis,29,20,So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
Genesis,29,21,"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is completed, that I may go in to her.”"
Genesis,29,22,Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.
Genesis,29,23,"Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and Jacob went in to her."
Genesis,29,24,Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid.
Genesis,29,25,"So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?”"
Genesis,29,26,"But Laban said, “It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn."
Genesis,29,27,"Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years.”"
Genesis,29,28,"Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife."
Genesis,29,29,Laban also gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.
Genesis,29,30,"So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and indeed he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years."
Genesis,29,31,"Now the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren."
Genesis,29,32,"Leah conceived and bore a son and named him Reuben, for she said, “Because the LORD has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me.”"
Genesis,29,33,"Then she conceived again and bore a son and said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also.” So she named him Simeon."
Genesis,29,34,"She conceived again and bore a son and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore he was named Levi."
Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again and bore a son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing."
Genesis,30,1,"Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die.”"
Genesis,30,2,"Then Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”"
Genesis,30,3,"She said, “Here is my maid Bilhah, go in to her that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children.”"
Genesis,30,4,"So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her."
Genesis,30,5,Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan."
Genesis,30,7,Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,8,"So Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed.” And she named him Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife."
Genesis,30,10,Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,"Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad."
Genesis,30,12,Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,13,"Then Leah said, “Happy am I! For women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,15,"But she said to her, “Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son’s mandrakes also?” So Rachel said, “Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,16,"When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, then Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night."
Genesis,30,17,"God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"Then Leah said, “God has given me my wages because I gave my maid to my husband.” So she named him Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis,30,20,"Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,Afterward she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
Genesis,30,22,"Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb."
Genesis,30,23,"So she conceived and bore a son and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”"
Genesis,30,24,"She named him Joseph, saying, “May the LORD give me another son.”"
Genesis,30,25,"Now it came about when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me depart; for you yourself know my service which I have rendered you.”"
Genesis,30,27,"But Laban said to him, “If now it pleases you, stay with me; I have divined that the LORD has blessed me on your account.”"
Genesis,30,28,"He continued, “Name me your wages, and I will give it.”"
Genesis,30,29,"But he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your cattle have fared with me."
Genesis,30,30,"For you had little before I came and it has increased to a multitude, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?”"
Genesis,30,31,"So he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flock:"
Genesis,30,32,"let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep and every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages."
Genesis,30,33,"So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, will be considered stolen.”"
Genesis,30,34,"Laban said, “Good, let it be according to your word.”"
Genesis,30,35,"So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons."
Genesis,30,36,"And he put a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks."
Genesis,30,37,"Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods."
Genesis,30,38,"He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink."
Genesis,30,39,"So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted."
Genesis,30,40,"Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock."
Genesis,30,41,"Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods;"
Genesis,30,42,"but when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s."
Genesis,30,43,"So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,31,1,"Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.”"
Genesis,31,2,"Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as formerly."
Genesis,31,3,"Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”"
Genesis,31,4,"So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,"
Genesis,31,5,"and said to them, “I see your father’s attitude, that it is not friendly toward me as formerly, but the God of my father has been with me."
Genesis,31,6,You know that I have served your father with all my strength.
Genesis,31,7,"Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to hurt me."
Genesis,31,8,"If he spoke thus, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock brought forth striped."
Genesis,31,9,Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and mottled."
Genesis,31,11,"Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’"
Genesis,31,12,"He said, ‘Lift up now your eyes and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”"
Genesis,31,14,"Rachel and Leah said to him, “Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?"
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price."
Genesis,31,16,"Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you.”"
Genesis,31,17,Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels;
Genesis,31,18,"and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,19,"When Laban had gone to shear his flock, then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father’s."
Genesis,31,20,And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.
Genesis,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the Euphrates River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,"When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,"
Genesis,31,23,"then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days’ journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, “Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.”"
Genesis,31,25,"Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,26,"Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?"
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre;"
Genesis,31,28,and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.
Genesis,31,29,"It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.’"
Genesis,31,30,Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father’s house; but why did you steal my gods?”
Genesis,31,31,"Then Jacob replied to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force."
Genesis,31,32,The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
Genesis,31,33,"So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent."
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddle, and she sat on them. And Laban felt through all the tent but did not find them."
Genesis,31,35,"She said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me.” So he searched but did not find the household idols."
Genesis,31,36,"Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, “What is my transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?"
Genesis,31,37,"Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two."
Genesis,31,38,"These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks."
Genesis,31,39,That which was torn of beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it of my hand whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Genesis,31,40,"Thus I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes."
Genesis,31,41,"These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times."
Genesis,31,42,"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night.”"
Genesis,31,43,"Then Laban replied to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?"
Genesis,31,44,"So now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.”"
Genesis,31,45,Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Genesis,31,46,"Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap."
Genesis,31,47,"Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed."
Genesis,31,48,"Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore it was named Galeed,"
Genesis,31,49,"and Mizpah, for he said, “May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other."
Genesis,31,50,"If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.”"
Genesis,31,51,"Laban said to Jacob, “Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me."
Genesis,31,52,"This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm."
Genesis,31,53,"The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,54,"Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain."
Genesis,31,55,"Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place."
Genesis,32,1,"Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him."
Genesis,32,2,"Jacob said when he saw them, “This is God’s camp.” So he named that place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"He also commanded them saying, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: ‘Thus says your servant Jacob, “I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now;"
Genesis,32,5,"I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.”’”"
Genesis,32,6,"The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”"
Genesis,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies;"
Genesis,32,8,"for he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape.”"
Genesis,32,9,"Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will prosper you,’"
Genesis,32,10,"I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff only I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two companies."
Genesis,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children."
Genesis,32,12,"For You said, ‘I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered.’”"
Genesis,32,13,So he spent the night there. Then he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau:
Genesis,32,14,"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
Genesis,32,15,"thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys."
Genesis,32,16,"He delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass on before me, and put a space between droves.”"
Genesis,32,17,"He commanded the one in front, saying, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?’"
Genesis,32,18,"then you shall say, ‘These belong to your servant Jacob; it is a present sent to my lord Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.’”"
Genesis,32,19,"Then he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the droves, saying, “After this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him;"
Genesis,32,20,"and you shall say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us.’” For he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me. Then afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.”"
Genesis,32,21,"So the present passed on before him, while he himself spent that night in the camp."
Genesis,32,22,"Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,He took them and sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had.
Genesis,32,24,"Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak."
Genesis,32,25,"When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him."
Genesis,32,26,"Then he said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” But he said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”"
Genesis,32,27,"So he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”"
Genesis,32,28,"He said, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed.”"
Genesis,32,29,"Then Jacob asked him and said, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask my name?” And he blessed him there."
Genesis,32,30,"So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, “I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been preserved.”"
Genesis,32,31,"Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore, to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip."
Genesis,33,1,"Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids."
Genesis,33,2,"He put the maids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last."
Genesis,33,3,"But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
Genesis,33,4,"Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept."
Genesis,33,5,"He lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” So he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”"
Genesis,33,6,"Then the maids came near with their children, and they bowed down."
Genesis,33,7,"Leah likewise came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"And he said, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” And he said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”"
Genesis,33,9,"But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own.”"
Genesis,33,10,"Jacob said, “No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably."
Genesis,33,11,"Please take my gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have plenty.” Thus he urged him and he took it."
Genesis,33,12,"Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you.”"
Genesis,33,13,"But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me. And if they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Please let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”"
Genesis,33,15,"Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”"
Genesis,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Genesis,33,17,"Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the place is named Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city."
Genesis,33,19,"He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money."
Genesis,33,20,Then he erected there an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
Genesis,34,1,"Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land."
Genesis,34,2,"When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force."
Genesis,34,3,"He was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her."
Genesis,34,4,"So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this young girl for a wife.”"
Genesis,34,5,"Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept silent until they came in."
Genesis,34,6,Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Genesis,34,7,"Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done."
Genesis,34,8,"But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage."
Genesis,34,9,Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.
Genesis,34,10,"Thus you shall live with us, and the land shall be open before you; live and trade in it and acquire property in it.”"
Genesis,34,11,"Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “If I find favor in your sight, then I will give whatever you say to me."
Genesis,34,12,"Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; but give me the girl in marriage.”"
Genesis,34,13,"But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit, because he had defiled Dinah their sister."
Genesis,34,14,"They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us."
Genesis,34,15,"Only on this condition will we consent to you: if you will become like us, in that every male of you be circumcised,"
Genesis,34,16,"then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”"
Genesis,34,18,"Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son."
Genesis,34,19,"The young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father."
Genesis,34,20,"So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,"
Genesis,34,21,"“These men are friendly with us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them."
Genesis,34,22,"Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised."
Genesis,34,23,"Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us.”"
Genesis,34,24,"All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city."
Genesis,34,25,"Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and killed every male."
Genesis,34,26,"They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went forth."
Genesis,34,27,"Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and looted the city, because they had defiled their sister."
Genesis,34,28,"They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field;"
Genesis,34,29,"and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even all that was in the houses."
Genesis,34,30,"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be destroyed, I and my household.”"
Genesis,34,31,"But they said, “Should he treat our sister as a harlot?”"
Genesis,35,1,"Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”"
Genesis,35,2,"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments;"
Genesis,35,3,"and let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”"
Genesis,35,4,"So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."
Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him."
Genesis,35,7,"He built an altar there, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother."
Genesis,35,8,"Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; it was named Allon-bacuth."
Genesis,35,9,"Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name.” Thus He called him Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"God also said to him, “I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings shall come forth from you."
Genesis,35,12,"“The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, And I will give the land to your descendants after you.”"
Genesis,35,13,Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
Genesis,35,14,"Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it."
Genesis,35,15,"So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel."
Genesis,35,16,"Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe labor."
Genesis,35,17,"When she was in severe labor the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for now you have another son.”"
Genesis,35,18,"It came about as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin."
Genesis,35,19,"So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis,35,20,Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.
Genesis,35,21,Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis,35,22,Now there were twelve sons of Jacob—
Genesis,35,23,"the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;"
Genesis,35,24,the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
Genesis,35,25,"and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali;"
Genesis,35,26,"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram."
Genesis,35,27,"Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned."
Genesis,35,28,Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
Genesis,35,29,"Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, an old man of ripe age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
Genesis,36,1,"Now these are the records of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom)."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
Genesis,36,3,"also Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, the sister of Nebaioth."
Genesis,36,4,"Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel,"
Genesis,36,5,and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,36,6,"Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to another land away from his brother Jacob."
Genesis,36,7,"For their property had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock."
Genesis,36,8,So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
Genesis,36,9,These then are the records of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau’s wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,11,"The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho and Gatam and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,Timna was a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah.
Genesis,36,13,"These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,14,"These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon: she bore to Esau, Jeush and Jalam and Korah."
Genesis,36,15,"These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,"
Genesis,36,16,"chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah."
Genesis,36,17,"These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,18,"These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah."
Genesis,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs."
Genesis,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,"
Genesis,36,21,"and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom."
Genesis,36,22,The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna.
Genesis,36,23,"These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam."
Genesis,36,24,These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah—he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
Genesis,36,25,"These are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah."
Genesis,36,26,These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
Genesis,36,27,These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
Genesis,36,28,These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
Genesis,36,29,"These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,"
Genesis,36,30,"chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, according to their various chiefs in the land of Seir."
Genesis,36,31,Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel.
Genesis,36,32,"Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah."
Genesis,36,33,"Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place."
Genesis,36,34,"Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites became king in his place."
Genesis,36,35,"Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, became king in his place; and the name of his city was Avith."
Genesis,36,36,"Then Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah became king in his place."
Genesis,36,37,"Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River became king in his place."
Genesis,36,38,"Then Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor became king in his place."
Genesis,36,39,"Then Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab."
Genesis,36,40,"Now these are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, according to their families and their localities, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,"
Genesis,36,41,"chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,"
Genesis,36,42,"chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,"
Genesis,36,43,"chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of the Edomites), according to their habitations in the land of their possession."
Genesis,37,1,"Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"These are the records of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, when seventeen years of age, was pasturing the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth, along with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives. And Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father."
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic."
Genesis,37,4,His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.
Genesis,37,5,"Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more."
Genesis,37,6,"He said to them, “Please listen to this dream which I have had;"
Genesis,37,7,"for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf rose up and also stood erect; and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.”"
Genesis,37,8,"Then his brothers said to him, “Are you actually going to reign over us? Or are you really going to rule over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words."
Genesis,37,9,"Now he had still another dream, and related it to his brothers, and said, “Lo, I have had still another dream; and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”"
Genesis,37,10,"He related it to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow ourselves down before you to the ground?”"
Genesis,37,11,"His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind."
Genesis,37,12,Then his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock in Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,"Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “I will go.”"
Genesis,37,14,"Then he said to him, “Go now and see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
Genesis,37,15,"A man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, “What are you looking for?”"
Genesis,37,16,"He said, “I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing the flock.”"
Genesis,37,17,"Then the man said, “They have moved from here; for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death."
Genesis,37,19,"They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer!"
Genesis,37,20,"Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, ‘A wild beast devoured him.’ Then let us see what will become of his dreams!”"
Genesis,37,21,"But Reuben heard this and rescued him out of their hands and said, “Let us not take his life.”"
Genesis,37,22,"Reuben further said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him”—that he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father."
Genesis,37,23,"So it came about, when Joseph reached his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the varicolored tunic that was on him;"
Genesis,37,24,"and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, without any water in it."
Genesis,37,25,"Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring them down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers listened to him."
Genesis,37,28,"Then some Midianite traders passed by, so they pulled him up and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. Thus they brought Joseph into Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"Now Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his garments."
Genesis,37,30,"He returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is not there; as for me, where am I to go?”"
Genesis,37,31,"So they took Joseph’s tunic, and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood;"
Genesis,37,32,"and they sent the varicolored tunic and brought it to their father and said, “We found this; please examine it to see whether it is your son’s tunic or not.”"
Genesis,37,33,"Then he examined it and said, “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!”"
Genesis,37,34,"So Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days."
Genesis,37,35,"Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, “Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son.” So his father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh’s officer, the captain of the bodyguard."
Genesis,38,1,"And it came about at that time, that Judah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her and went in to her.
Genesis,38,3,So she conceived and bore a son and he named him Er.
Genesis,38,4,Then she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan.
Genesis,38,5,She bore still another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Chezib that she bore him.
Genesis,38,6,"Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD took his life."
Genesis,38,8,"Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”"
Genesis,38,9,"Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother’s wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother."
Genesis,38,10,But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also.
Genesis,38,11,"Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”; for he thought, “I am afraid that he too may die like his brothers.” So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house."
Genesis,38,12,"Now after a considerable time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
Genesis,38,13,"It was told to Tamar, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”"
Genesis,38,14,"So she removed her widow’s garments and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, “Here now, let me come in to you”; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”"
Genesis,38,17,"He said, therefore, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, moreover, “Will you give a pledge until you send it?”"
Genesis,38,18,"He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” And she said, “Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him."
Genesis,38,19,"Then she arose and departed, and removed her veil and put on her widow’s garments."
Genesis,38,20,"When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, he did not find her."
Genesis,38,21,"He asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?” But they said, “There has been no temple prostitute here.”"
Genesis,38,22,"So he returned to Judah, and said, “I did not find her; and furthermore, the men of the place said, ‘There has been no temple prostitute here.’”"
Genesis,38,23,"Then Judah said, “Let her keep them, otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her.”"
Genesis,38,24,"Now it was about three months later that Judah was informed, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot, and behold, she is also with child by harlotry.” Then Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”"
Genesis,38,25,"It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man to whom these things belong.” And she said, “Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?”"
Genesis,38,26,"Judah recognized them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not have relations with her again."
Genesis,38,27,"It came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”"
Genesis,38,29,"But it came about as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out. Then she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was named Perez."
Genesis,38,30,Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and he was named Zerah.
Genesis,39,1,"Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there."
Genesis,39,2,"The LORD was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian."
Genesis,39,3,Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and how the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Genesis,39,4,"So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge."
Genesis,39,5,"It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph; thus the LORD’S blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field."
Genesis,39,6,So he left everything he owned in Joseph’s charge; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
Genesis,39,7,"It came about after these events that his master’s wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, “Lie with me.”"
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge."
Genesis,39,9,"There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?”"
Genesis,39,10,"As she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her."
Genesis,39,11,"Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside."
Genesis,39,12,"She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside."
Genesis,39,13,"When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,"
Genesis,39,14,"she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed."
Genesis,39,15,"When he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside.”"
Genesis,39,16,So she left his garment beside her until his master came home.
Genesis,39,17,"Then she spoke to him with these words, “The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me;"
Genesis,39,18,"and as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”"
Genesis,39,19,"Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” his anger burned."
Genesis,39,20,"So Joseph’s master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined; and he was there in the jail."
Genesis,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer."
Genesis,39,22,"The chief jailer committed to Joseph’s charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible for it."
Genesis,39,23,"The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph’s charge because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made to prosper."
Genesis,40,1,"Then it came about after these things, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker."
Genesis,40,3,"So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the jail, the same place where Joseph was imprisoned."
Genesis,40,4,"The captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time."
Genesis,40,5,"Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation."
Genesis,40,6,"When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected."
Genesis,40,7,"He asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in confinement in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so sad today?”"
Genesis,40,8,"Then they said to him, “We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, please.”"
Genesis,40,9,"So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, there was a vine in front of me;"
Genesis,40,10,"and on the vine were three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, and its clusters produced ripe grapes."
Genesis,40,11,"Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”"
Genesis,40,12,"Then Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;"
Genesis,40,13,within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer.
Genesis,40,14,"Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house."
Genesis,40,15,"For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.”"
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, “I also saw in my dream, and behold, there were three baskets of white bread on my head;"
Genesis,40,17,"and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”"
Genesis,40,18,"Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;"
Genesis,40,19,"within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.”"
Genesis,40,20,"Thus it came about on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants."
Genesis,40,21,"He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;"
Genesis,40,22,"but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them."
Genesis,40,23,"Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
Genesis,41,1,"Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile."
Genesis,41,2,"And lo, from the Nile there came up seven cows, sleek and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass."
Genesis,41,3,"Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile."
Genesis,41,4,The ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis,41,5,"He fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good."
Genesis,41,6,"Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them."
Genesis,41,7,"The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I would make mention today of my own offenses."
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, both me and the chief baker."
Genesis,41,11,"We had a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream."
Genesis,41,12,"Now a Hebrew youth was with us there, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we related them to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. To each one he interpreted according to his own dream."
Genesis,41,13,"And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; he restored me in my office, but he hanged him.”"
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”"
Genesis,41,16,"Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”"
Genesis,41,17,"So Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile;"
Genesis,41,18,"and behold, seven cows, fat and sleek came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass."
Genesis,41,19,"Lo, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such as I had never seen for ugliness in all the land of Egypt;"
Genesis,41,20,and the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
Genesis,41,21,"Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had devoured them, for they were just as ugly as before. Then I awoke."
Genesis,41,22,"I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears, full and good, came up on a single stalk;"
Genesis,41,23,"and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them;"
Genesis,41,24,"and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”"
Genesis,41,25,"Now Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams are one and the same; God has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do."
Genesis,41,26,The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one and the same.
Genesis,41,27,"The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine."
Genesis,41,28,It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis,41,29,"Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt;"
Genesis,41,30,"and after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will ravage the land."
Genesis,41,31,So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it will be very severe.
Genesis,41,32,"Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is determined by God, and God will quickly bring it about."
Genesis,41,33,"Now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him exact a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance."
Genesis,41,35,"Then let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh’s authority, and let them guard it."
Genesis,41,36,"Let the food become as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish during the famine.”"
Genesis,41,37,Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
Genesis,41,38,"Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, in whom is a divine spirit?”"
Genesis,41,39,"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are."
Genesis,41,40,"You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater than you.”"
Genesis,41,41,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,42,"Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck."
Genesis,41,43,"He had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, “Bow the knee!” And he set him over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,45,"Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,"Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,47,During the seven years of plenty the land brought forth abundantly.
Genesis,41,48,So he gathered all the food of these seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities; he placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.
Genesis,41,49,"Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure."
Genesis,41,50,"Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis,41,51,"Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”"
Genesis,41,52,"He named the second Ephraim, “For,” he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”"
Genesis,41,53,"When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt came to an end,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis,41,55,"So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do.”"
Genesis,41,56,"When the famine was spread over all the face of the earth, then Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"The people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth."
Genesis,42,1,"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?”"
Genesis,42,2,"He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die.”"
Genesis,42,3,Then ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm may befall him.”"
Genesis,42,5,"So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also."
Genesis,42,6,Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
Genesis,42,7,"When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. And he said to them, “Where have you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”"
Genesis,42,8,"But Joseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and said to them, “You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land.”"
Genesis,42,10,"Then they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food."
Genesis,42,11,"We are all sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies.”"
Genesis,42,12,"Yet he said to them, “No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!”"
Genesis,42,13,"But they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers in all, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive.”"
Genesis,42,14,"Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies;"
Genesis,42,15,"by this you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here!"
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you that he may get your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.”"
Genesis,42,17,So he put them all together in prison for three days.
Genesis,42,18,"Now Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear God:"
Genesis,42,19,"if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for the rest of you, go, carry grain for the famine of your households,"
Genesis,42,20,"and bring your youngest brother to me, so your words may be verified, and you will not die.” And they did so."
Genesis,42,21,"Then they said to one another, “Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us.”"
Genesis,42,22,"Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Now comes the reckoning for his blood.”"
Genesis,42,23,"They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them."
Genesis,42,24,"He turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man’s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them."
Genesis,42,26,So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there.
Genesis,42,27,"As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,42,28,"Then he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack.” And their hearts sank, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”"
Genesis,42,29,"When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,"
Genesis,42,30,"“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country."
Genesis,42,31,"But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies."
Genesis,42,32,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’"
Genesis,42,33,"The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households, and go."
Genesis,42,34,"But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.’”"
Genesis,42,35,"Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed."
Genesis,42,36,"Their father Jacob said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me.”"
Genesis,42,37,"Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you.”"
Genesis,42,38,"But Jacob said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”"
Genesis,43,1,Now the famine was severe in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"So it came about when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.”"
Genesis,43,3,"Judah spoke to him, however, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’"
Genesis,43,4,"If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food."
Genesis,43,5,"But if you do not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”"
Genesis,43,6,"Then Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man whether you still had another brother?”"
Genesis,43,7,"But they said, “The man questioned particularly about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ So we answered his questions. Could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”"
Genesis,43,8,"Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the lad with me and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones."
Genesis,43,9,"I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever."
Genesis,43,10,"For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice.”"
Genesis,43,11,"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man as a present, a little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds."
Genesis,43,12,"Take double the money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake."
Genesis,43,13,"Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man;"
Genesis,43,14,"and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”"
Genesis,43,15,"So the men took this present, and they took double the money in their hand, and Benjamin; then they arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Bring the men into the house, and slay an animal and make ready; for the men are to dine with me at noon.”"
Genesis,43,17,"So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house."
Genesis,43,18,"Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, and take us for slaves with our donkeys.”"
Genesis,43,19,"So they came near to Joseph’s house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,"
Genesis,43,20,"and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food,"
Genesis,43,21,"and it came about when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand."
Genesis,43,22,We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks.”
Genesis,43,23,"He said, “Be at ease, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them."
Genesis,43,24,"Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder."
Genesis,43,25,So they prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
Genesis,43,26,"When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which was in their hand and bowed to the ground before him."
Genesis,43,27,"Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, “Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”"
Genesis,43,28,"They said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” They bowed down in homage."
Genesis,43,29,"As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” And he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”"
Genesis,43,30,"Joseph hurried out for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there."
Genesis,43,31,"Then he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.”"
Genesis,43,32,"So they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is loathsome to the Egyptians."
Genesis,43,33,"Now they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment."
Genesis,43,34,"He took portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him."
Genesis,44,1,"Then he commanded his house steward, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack."
Genesis,44,2,"Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph had told him."
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4,"They had just gone out of the city, and were not far off, when Joseph said to his house steward, “Up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?"
Genesis,44,5,Is not this the one from which my lord drinks and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.’”
Genesis,44,6,So he overtook them and spoke these words to them.
Genesis,44,7,"They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing."
Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?"
Genesis,44,9,"With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”"
Genesis,44,10,"So he said, “Now let it also be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be innocent.”"
Genesis,44,11,"Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack."
Genesis,44,12,"He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack."
Genesis,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and when each man loaded his donkey, they returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him."
Genesis,44,15,"Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed practice divination?”"
Genesis,44,16,"So Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found.”"
Genesis,44,17,"But he said, “Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”"
Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah approached him, and said, “Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’"
Genesis,44,20,"We said to my lord, ‘We have an old father and a little child of his old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.’"
Genesis,44,21,"Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him.’"
Genesis,44,22,"But we said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’"
Genesis,44,23,"You said to your servants, however, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’"
Genesis,44,24,"Thus it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
Genesis,44,25,"Our father said, ‘Go back, buy us a little food.’"
Genesis,44,26,"But we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’"
Genesis,44,27,"Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;"
Genesis,44,28,"and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces,” and I have not seen him since."
Genesis,44,29,"If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’"
Genesis,44,30,"Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad’s life,"
Genesis,44,31,"when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die. Thus your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow."
Genesis,44,32,"For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever.’"
Genesis,44,33,"Now, therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers."
Genesis,44,34,For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me—for fear that I see the evil that would overtake my father?”
Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, “Have everyone go out from me.” So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of it."
Genesis,45,3,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come closer to me.” And they came closer. And he said, “I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,"Now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life."
Genesis,45,6,"For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting."
Genesis,45,7,"God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance."
Genesis,45,8,"Now, therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay."
Genesis,45,10,"You shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have."
Genesis,45,11,"There I will also provide for you, for there are still five years of famine to come, and you and your household and all that you have would be impoverished.”’"
Genesis,45,12,"Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which is speaking to you."
Genesis,45,13,"Now you must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and all that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here.”"
Genesis,45,14,"Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."
Genesis,45,15,"He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him."
Genesis,45,16,"Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants."
Genesis,45,17,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan,"
Genesis,45,18,"and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat of the land.’"
Genesis,45,19,"Now you are ordered, ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come."
Genesis,45,20,"Do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”"
Genesis,45,21,"Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey."
Genesis,45,22,"To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments."
Genesis,45,23,"To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey."
Genesis,45,24,"So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the journey.”"
Genesis,45,25,"Then they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob."
Genesis,45,26,"They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” But he was stunned, for he did not believe them."
Genesis,45,27,"When they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived."
Genesis,45,28,"Then Israel said, “It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”"
Genesis,46,1,"So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
Genesis,46,2,"God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,46,3,"He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there."
Genesis,46,4,"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph will close your eyes.”"
Genesis,46,5,Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis,46,6,"They took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him:"
Genesis,46,7,"his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt."
Genesis,46,8,"Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn."
Genesis,46,9,The sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi.
Genesis,46,10,The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
Genesis,46,11,"The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Genesis,46,12,The sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis,46,13,The sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvvah and Iob and Shimron.
Genesis,46,14,The sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel.
Genesis,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three."
Genesis,46,16,"The sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli."
Genesis,46,17,The sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
Genesis,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons."
Genesis,46,19,The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,46,20,"Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis,46,21,"The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard."
Genesis,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; there were fourteen persons in all."
Genesis,46,23,The sons of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis,46,24,The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.
Genesis,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; there were seven persons in all."
Genesis,46,26,"All the persons belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob’s sons, were sixty-six persons in all,"
Genesis,46,27,"and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy."
Genesis,46,28,"Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out the way before him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
Genesis,46,29,"Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time."
Genesis,46,30,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”"
Genesis,46,31,"Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me;"
Genesis,46,32,"and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’"
Genesis,46,33,"When Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’"
Genesis,46,34,"you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,’ that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians.”"
Genesis,47,1,"Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,2,He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,"Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” So they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.”"
Genesis,47,4,"They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now, therefore, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,5,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you."
Genesis,47,6,"The land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land, let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”"
Genesis,47,7,Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,8,"Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many years have you lived?”"
Genesis,47,9,"So Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty; few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, nor have they attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning.”"
Genesis,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from his presence."
Genesis,47,11,"So Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered."
Genesis,47,12,"Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to their little ones."
Genesis,47,13,"Now there was no food in all the land, because the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine."
Genesis,47,14,"Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house."
Genesis,47,15,"When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone.”"
Genesis,47,16,"Then Joseph said, “Give up your livestock, and I will give you food for your livestock, since your money is gone.”"
Genesis,47,17,"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year."
Genesis,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent, and the cattle are my lord’s. There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our lands."
Genesis,47,19,"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. So give us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”"
Genesis,47,20,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh’s."
Genesis,47,21,"As for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of Egypt’s border to the other."
Genesis,47,22,"Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land."
Genesis,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, and you may sow the land."
Genesis,47,24,"At the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones.”"
Genesis,47,25,"So they said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”"
Genesis,47,26,"Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt valid to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s."
Genesis,47,27,"Now Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous."
Genesis,47,28,Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the length of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
Genesis,47,29,"When the time for Israel to die drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “Please, if I have found favor in your sight, place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and faithfulness. Please do not bury me in Egypt,"
Genesis,47,30,"but when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” And he said, “I will do as you have said.”"
Genesis,47,31,"He said, “Swear to me.” So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed in worship at the head of the bed."
Genesis,48,1,"Now it came about after these things that Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is sick.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him."
Genesis,48,2,"When it was told to Jacob, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel collected his strength and sat up in the bed."
Genesis,48,3,"Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,"
Genesis,48,4,"and He said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’"
Genesis,48,5,"Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are."
Genesis,48,6,But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
Genesis,48,7,"Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”"
Genesis,48,8,"When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”"
Genesis,48,9,"Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” So he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.”"
Genesis,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were so dim from age that he could not see. Then Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them."
Genesis,48,11,"Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let me see your children as well.”"
Genesis,48,12,"Then Joseph took them from his knees, and bowed with his face to the ground."
Genesis,48,13,"Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them close to him."
Genesis,48,14,"But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, crossing his hands, although Manasseh was the firstborn."
Genesis,48,15,"He blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,"
Genesis,48,16,"The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; And may my name live on in them, And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”"
Genesis,48,17,"When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him; and he grasped his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head."
Genesis,48,18,"Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand on his head.”"
Genesis,48,19,"But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know; he also will become a people and he also will be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.”"
Genesis,48,20,"He blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will pronounce blessing, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!’” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh."
Genesis,48,21,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers."
Genesis,48,22,"I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.”"
Genesis,49,1,"Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, “Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will befall you in the days to come."
Genesis,49,2,"“Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob; And listen to Israel your father."
Genesis,49,3,"“Reuben, you are my firstborn; My might and the beginning of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power."
Genesis,49,4,"“Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father’s bed; Then you defiled it—he went up to my couch."
Genesis,49,5,“Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their swords are implements of violence.
Genesis,49,6,"“Let my soul not enter into their council; Let not my glory be united with their assembly; Because in their anger they slew men, And in their self-will they lamed oxen."
Genesis,49,7,"“Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel. I will disperse them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel."
Genesis,49,8,"“Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father’s sons shall bow down to you."
Genesis,49,9,"“Judah is a lion’s whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him up?"
Genesis,49,10,"“The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples."
Genesis,49,11,"“He ties his foal to the vine, And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes."
Genesis,49,12,"“His eyes are dull from wine, And his teeth white from milk."
Genesis,49,13,"“Zebulun will dwell at the seashore; And he shall be a haven for ships, And his flank shall be toward Sidon."
Genesis,49,14,"“Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between the sheepfolds."
Genesis,49,15,"“When he saw that a resting place was good And that the land was pleasant, He bowed his shoulder to bear burdens, And became a slave at forced labor."
Genesis,49,16,"“Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel."
Genesis,49,17,"“Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path, That bites the horse’s heels, So that his rider falls backward."
Genesis,49,18,"“For Your salvation I wait, O LORD."
Genesis,49,19,"“As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, But he will raid at their heels."
Genesis,49,20,"“As for Asher, his food shall be rich, And he will yield royal dainties."
Genesis,49,21,"“Naphtali is a doe let loose, He gives beautiful words."
Genesis,49,22,"“Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a spring; Its branches run over a wall."
Genesis,49,23,"“The archers bitterly attacked him, And shot at him and harassed him;"
Genesis,49,24,"But his bow remained firm, And his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),"
Genesis,49,25,"From the God of your father who helps you, And by the Almighty who blesses you With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb."
Genesis,49,26,"“The blessings of your father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers."
Genesis,49,27,"“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he devours the prey, And in the evening he divides the spoil.”"
Genesis,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him."
Genesis,49,29,"Then he charged them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
Genesis,49,30,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site."
Genesis,49,31,"There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah—"
Genesis,49,32,"the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth.”"
Genesis,49,33,"When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,50,1,"Then Joseph fell on his father’s face, and wept over him and kissed him."
Genesis,50,2,Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis,50,3,"Now forty days were required for it, for such is the period required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days."
Genesis,50,4,"When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please speak to Pharaoh, saying,"
Genesis,50,5,"‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’”"
Genesis,50,6,"Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”"
Genesis,50,7,"So Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
Genesis,50,8,and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father’s household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.
Genesis,50,9,There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company.
Genesis,50,10,"When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he observed seven days mourning for his father."
Genesis,50,11,"Now when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
Genesis,50,12,Thus his sons did for him as he had charged them;
Genesis,50,13,"for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite."
Genesis,50,14,"After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father."
Genesis,50,15,"When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him!”"
Genesis,50,16,"So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father charged before he died, saying,"
Genesis,50,17,"‘Thus you shall say to Joseph, “Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong.”’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
Genesis,50,18,"Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”"
Genesis,50,19,"But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in God’s place?"
Genesis,50,20,"As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive."
Genesis,50,21,"So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.” So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them."
Genesis,50,22,"Now Joseph stayed in Egypt, he and his father’s household, and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years."
Genesis,50,23,"Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s sons; also the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees."
Genesis,50,24,"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob.”"
Genesis,50,25,"Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones up from here.”"
Genesis,50,26,So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
Exodus,1,1,Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came each one with his household:
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,"All the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number, but Joseph was already in Egypt."
Exodus,1,6,"Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph."
Exodus,1,9,"He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we."
Exodus,1,10,"Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land.”"
Exodus,1,11,"So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel."
Exodus,1,13,The Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously;
Exodus,1,14,"and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them."
Exodus,1,15,"Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other was named Puah;"
Exodus,1,16,"and he said, “When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see them upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live."
Exodus,1,18,"So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them.”"
Exodus,1,20,"So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty."
Exodus,1,21,"Because the midwives feared God, He established households for them."
Exodus,1,22,"Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you are to cast into the Nile, and every daughter you are to keep alive.”"
Exodus,2,1,Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi.
Exodus,2,2,"The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a wicker basket and covered it over with tar and pitch. Then she put the child into it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile."
Exodus,2,4,His sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,"The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it to her."
Exodus,2,6,"When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the boy was crying. And she had pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”"
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go ahead.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren."
Exodus,2,12,"So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"He went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, “Why are you striking your companion?”"
Exodus,2,14,"But he said, “Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Surely the matter has become known.”"
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
Exodus,2,17,"Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"When they came to Reuel their father, he said, “Why have you come back so soon today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"So they said, “An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,"He said to his daughters, “Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”"
Exodus,2,21,"Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses."
Exodus,2,22,"Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"Now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to God."
Exodus,2,24,"So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them."
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,"The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"So Moses said, “I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up.”"
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”"
Exodus,3,5,"Then He said, “Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"He said also, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"The LORD said, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings."
Exodus,3,8,"So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite."
Exodus,3,9,"Now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them."
Exodus,3,10,"Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"And He said, “Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Then Moses said to God, “Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ Now they may say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”"
Exodus,3,15,"God, furthermore, said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt."
Exodus,3,17,"So I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’"
Exodus,3,18,"They will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt and you will say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,"But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion."
Exodus,3,20,So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21,"I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,4,1,"Then Moses said, “What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’”"
Exodus,4,2,"The LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.”"
Exodus,4,3,"Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it."
Exodus,4,4,"But the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand and grasp it by its tail”—so he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand—"
Exodus,4,5,"“that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”"
Exodus,4,6,"The LORD furthermore said to him, “Now put your hand into your bosom.” So he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow."
Exodus,4,7,"Then He said, “Put your hand into your bosom again.” So he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh."
Exodus,4,8,"“If they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the witness of the last sign."
Exodus,4,9,"But if they will not believe even these two signs or heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”"
Exodus,4,10,"Then Moses said to the LORD, “Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”"
Exodus,4,11,"The LORD said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?"
Exodus,4,12,"Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say.”"
Exodus,4,13,"But he said, “Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever You will.”"
Exodus,4,14,"Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, “Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do."
Exodus,4,16,"Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him."
Exodus,4,17,"You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.”"
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,"So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"The LORD said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Israel is My son, My firstborn."
Exodus,4,23,"So I said to you, ‘Let My son go that he may serve Me’; but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.”’”"
Exodus,4,24,Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
Exodus,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet, and she said, “You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me.”"
Exodus,4,26,"So He let him alone. At that time she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood”—because of the circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"Now the LORD said to Aaron, “Go to meet Moses in the wilderness.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do."
Exodus,4,29,Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel;
Exodus,4,30,and Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses. He then performed the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus,4,31,"So the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed low and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.’”"
Exodus,5,2,"But Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and besides, I will not let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, otherwise He will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labors!”"
Exodus,5,5,"Again Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!”"
Exodus,5,6,"So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying,"
Exodus,5,7,“You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus,5,8,"But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,"Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words.”"
Exodus,5,10,"So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I am not going to give you any straw."
Exodus,5,11,"You go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but none of your labor will be reduced.’”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus,5,13,"The taskmasters pressed them, saying, “Complete your work quota, your daily amount, just as when you had straw.”"
Exodus,5,14,"Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?”"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?"
Exodus,5,16,"There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people.”"
Exodus,5,17,"But he said, “You are lazy, very lazy; therefore you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’"
Exodus,5,18,"So go now and work; for you will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, “You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,20,"When they left Pharaoh’s presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them."
Exodus,5,21,"They said to them, “May the LORD look upon you and judge you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh’s sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, “O Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me?"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he will let them go, and under compulsion he will drive them out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,2,"God spoke further to Moses and said to him, “I am the LORD;"
Exodus,6,3,"and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned."
Exodus,6,5,"Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments."
Exodus,6,7,"Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you for a possession; I am the LORD.’”"
Exodus,6,9,"So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of their despondency and cruel bondage."
Exodus,6,10,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, “Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?”"
Exodus,6,13,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers’ households. The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
Exodus,6,16,These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the length of Levi’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years.
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families."
Exodus,6,18,The sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the length of Kohath’s life was one hundred and thirty-three years.
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years."
Exodus,6,21,The sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.
Exodus,6,22,The sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,The sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
Exodus,6,25,"Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites according to their families."
Exodus,6,26,"It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.”"
Exodus,6,27,They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was the same Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,6,28,"Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “I am the LORD; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses said before the LORD, “Behold, I am unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land."
Exodus,7,3,But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,7,4,"When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments."
Exodus,7,5,"The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.”"
Exodus,7,6,"So Moses and Aaron did it; as the LORD commanded them, thus they did."
Exodus,7,7,"Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh."
Exodus,7,8,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Work a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.’”"
Exodus,7,10,"So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent."
Exodus,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts."
Exodus,7,12,For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
Exodus,7,13,"Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent."
Exodus,7,16,"You shall say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you have not listened until now.”"
Exodus,7,17,"Thus says the LORD, “By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile.”’”"
Exodus,7,19,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”"
Exodus,7,20,"So Moses and Aaron did even as the LORD had commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood."
Exodus,7,21,"The fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was through all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,23,Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this.
Exodus,7,24,"So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile."
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
Exodus,8,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,2,"But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite your whole territory with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls."
Exodus,8,4,So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants.”’”
Exodus,8,5,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,"The magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Entreat the LORD that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, “The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I entreat for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, that they may be left only in the Nile?”"
Exodus,8,10,"Then he said, “Tomorrow.” So he said, “May it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God."
Exodus,8,11,The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile.”
Exodus,8,12,"Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"The LORD did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courts, and the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats through all the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,17,"They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"The magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast."
Exodus,8,19,"Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,20,"Now the LORD said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he comes out to the water, and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,21,"For if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they dwell."
Exodus,8,22,"But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of flies will be there, in order that you may know that I, the LORD, am in the midst of the land."
Exodus,8,23,I will put a division between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will occur.”’”
Exodus,8,24,Then the LORD did so. And there came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of flies in all the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,25,"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.”"
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses said, “It is not right to do so, for we will sacrifice to the LORD our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not then stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,We must go a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us.”
Exodus,8,28,"Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make supplication for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"Then Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall make supplication to the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully again in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,30,So Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.
Exodus,8,31,"The LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people; not one remained."
Exodus,8,32,"But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and speak to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,2,"For if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them,"
Exodus,9,3,"behold, the hand of the LORD will come with a very severe pestilence on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks."
Exodus,9,4,"But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel.”’”"
Exodus,9,5,"The LORD set a definite time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,"So the LORD did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died."
Exodus,9,7,"Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take for yourselves handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,10,"So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"And the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,14,"For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"For if by now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut off from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"But, indeed, for this reason I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go.
Exodus,9,18,"Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now."
Exodus,9,19,"Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die.”’”"
Exodus,9,20,The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses;
Exodus,9,21,but he who paid no regard to the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"Now the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"The hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time; the LORD is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones."
Exodus,9,28,"Make supplication to the LORD, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”"
Exodus,9,29,"Moses said to him, “As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease and there will be hail no longer, that you may know that the earth is the LORD’S."
Exodus,9,30,"But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God.”"
Exodus,9,31,"(Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they ripen late.)"
Exodus,9,33,"So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the LORD; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
Exodus,9,35,"Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of Mine among them,"
Exodus,10,2,"and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and how I performed My signs among them, that you may know that I am the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,3,"Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,10,4,"For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory."
Exodus,10,5,"They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They will also eat the rest of what has escaped—what is left to you from the hail—and they will eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field."
Exodus,10,6,"Then your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, something which neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day.’” And he turned and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the LORD your God! Who are the ones that are going?”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moses said, “We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we shall go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,10,"Then he said to them, “Thus may the LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Take heed, for evil is in your mind."
Exodus,10,11,"Not so! Go now, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desire.” So they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence."
Exodus,10,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat every plant of the land, even all that the hail has left.”"
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; they were very numerous. There had never been so many locusts, nor would there be so many again."
Exodus,10,15,"For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and make supplication to the LORD your God, that He would only remove this death from me.”"
Exodus,10,18,He went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,So the LORD shifted the wind to a very strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go."
Exodus,10,21,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings."
Exodus,10,24,"Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Even your little ones may go with you.”"
Exodus,10,25,"But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the LORD our God. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the LORD.”"
Exodus,10,27,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!”"
Exodus,10,29,"Moses said, “You are right; I shall never see your face again!”"
Exodus,11,1,"Now the LORD said to Moses, “One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely."
Exodus,11,2,Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold.”
Exodus,11,3,"The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Furthermore, the man Moses himself was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, both in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people."
Exodus,11,4,"Moses said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,"
Exodus,11,5,"and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the firstborn of the cattle as well."
Exodus,11,6,"Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again."
Exodus,11,7,"But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’"
Exodus,11,8,"All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who follow you,’ and after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger."
Exodus,11,9,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land."
Exodus,12,1,"Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,12,2,“This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to you.
Exodus,12,3,"Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers’ households, a lamb for each household."
Exodus,12,4,"Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons in them; according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb."
Exodus,12,5,Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
Exodus,12,6,"You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight."
Exodus,12,7,"Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it."
Exodus,12,8,"They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Exodus,12,9,"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, both its head and its legs along with its entrails."
Exodus,12,10,"And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire."
Exodus,12,11,"Now you shall eat it in this manner: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste—it is the LORD’S Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments—I am the LORD."
Exodus,12,13,"The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,"‘Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance."
Exodus,12,15,"Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you."
Exodus,12,17,"You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance."
Exodus,12,18,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening."
Exodus,12,19,"Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an alien or a native of the land."
Exodus,12,20,You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.’”
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Passover lamb."
Exodus,12,22,"You shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning."
Exodus,12,23,"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you."
Exodus,12,24,And you shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children forever.
Exodus,12,25,"When you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, you shall observe this rite."
Exodus,12,26,"And when your children say to you, ‘What does this rite mean to you?’"
Exodus,12,27,"you shall say, ‘It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but spared our homes.’” And the people bowed low and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,"Then the sons of Israel went and did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did."
Exodus,12,29,"Now it came about at midnight that the LORD struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle."
Exodus,12,30,"Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead."
Exodus,12,31,"Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the LORD, as you have said."
Exodus,12,32,"Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also.”"
Exodus,12,33,"The Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We will all be dead.”"
Exodus,12,34,"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders."
Exodus,12,35,"Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;"
Exodus,12,36,"and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Thus they plundered the Egyptians."
Exodus,12,37,"Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children."
Exodus,12,38,"A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock."
Exodus,12,39,"They baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus,12,41,"And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"It is a night to be observed for the LORD for having brought them out from the land of Egypt; this night is for the LORD, to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations."
Exodus,12,43,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat of it;"
Exodus,12,44,"but every man’s slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it."
Exodus,12,45,A sojourner or a hired servant shall not eat of it.
Exodus,12,46,"It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it."
Exodus,12,47,All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this.
Exodus,12,48,"But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat of it."
Exodus,12,49,The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who sojourns among you.”
Exodus,12,50,Then all the sons of Israel did so; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,51,And on that same day the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
Exodus,13,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Sanctify to Me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me.”"
Exodus,13,3,"Moses said to the people, “Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. And nothing leavened shall be eaten."
Exodus,13,4,"On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go forth."
Exodus,13,5,"It shall be when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall observe this rite in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD."
Exodus,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders."
Exodus,13,8,"You shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,"Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year."
Exodus,13,11,"“Now when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,"
Exodus,13,12,"you shall devote to the LORD the first offspring of every womb, and the first offspring of every beast that you own; the males belong to the LORD."
Exodus,13,13,"But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem."
Exodus,13,14,"And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery."
Exodus,13,15,"It came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, the first offspring of every womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’"
Exodus,13,16,"So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,17,"Now when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, “The people might change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt.
Exodus,13,19,"Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, “God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you.”"
Exodus,13,20,Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus,13,21,"The LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night."
Exodus,13,22,"He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people."
Exodus,14,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,14,2,"“Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea."
Exodus,14,3,"For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’"
Exodus,14,4,"Thus I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” And they did so."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”"
Exodus,14,6,So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him;
Exodus,14,7,"and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them."
Exodus,14,8,"The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out boldly."
Exodus,14,9,"Then the Egyptians chased after them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"As Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD."
Exodus,14,11,"Then they said to Moses, “Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”"
Exodus,14,13,"But Moses said to the people, “Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever."
Exodus,14,14,The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent.”
Exodus,14,15,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward."
Exodus,14,16,"As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land."
Exodus,14,17,"As for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,"The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them."
Exodus,14,20,"So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night."
Exodus,14,21,"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided."
Exodus,14,22,"The sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,23,"Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,24,"At the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion."
Exodus,14,25,"He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,"So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh’s entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained."
Exodus,14,29,"But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,30,"Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore."
Exodus,14,31,"When Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said, “I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"“The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; This is my God, and I will praise Him; My father’s God, and I will extol Him."
Exodus,15,3,“The LORD is a warrior; The LORD is His name.
Exodus,15,4,“Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,“The deeps cover them; They went down into the depths like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"“Your right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power, Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,"“And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You; You send forth Your burning anger, and it consumes them as chaff."
Exodus,15,8,"“At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up, The flowing waters stood up like a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea."
Exodus,15,9,"“The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be gratified against them; I will draw out my sword, my hand will destroy them.’"
Exodus,15,10,"“You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"“Who is like You among the gods, O LORD? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders?"
Exodus,15,12,"“You stretched out Your right hand, The earth swallowed them."
Exodus,15,13,“In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed; In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.
Exodus,15,14,"“The peoples have heard, they tremble; Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia."
Exodus,15,15,"“Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away."
Exodus,15,16,"“Terror and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone; Until Your people pass over, O LORD, Until the people pass over whom You have purchased."
Exodus,15,17,"“You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, The place, O LORD, which You have made for Your dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established."
Exodus,15,18,“The LORD shall reign forever and ever.”
Exodus,15,19,"For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea."
Exodus,15,20,"Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam answered them, “Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea.”"
Exodus,15,22,"Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water."
Exodus,15,23,"When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah."
Exodus,15,24,"So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"Then he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There He made for them a statute and regulation, and there He tested them."
Exodus,15,26,"And He said, “If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters."
Exodus,16,1,"Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
Exodus,16,3,"The sons of Israel said to them, “Would that we had died by the LORD’S hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction."
Exodus,16,5,"On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.”"
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, “At evening you will know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt;"
Exodus,16,7,"and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your grumblings against the LORD; and what are we, that you grumble against us?”"
Exodus,16,8,"Moses said, “This will happen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, ‘Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.’”"
Exodus,16,10,"It came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”"
Exodus,16,13,"So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp."
Exodus,16,14,"When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"This is what the LORD has commanded, ‘Gather of it every man as much as he should eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.’”"
Exodus,16,17,"The sons of Israel did so, and some gathered much and some little."
Exodus,16,18,"When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat."
Exodus,16,19,"Moses said to them, “Let no man leave any of it until morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"They gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the sun grew hot, it would melt."
Exodus,16,22,"Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,"
Exodus,16,23,"then he said to them, “This is what the LORD meant: Tomorrow is a sabbath observance, a holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.”"
Exodus,16,24,"So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it."
Exodus,16,25,"Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will be none.”"
Exodus,16,27,"It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions?"
Exodus,16,29,"See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.”"
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"The house of Israel named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"Then Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded, ‘Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,16,33,"Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"The sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus,17,1,"Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water that we may drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Moses and said, “Why, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “What shall I do to this people? A little more and they will stone me.”"
Exodus,17,5,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"He named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us, or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses’ hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”"
Exodus,17,15,Moses built an altar and named it The LORD is My Banner;
Exodus,17,16,"and he said, “The LORD has sworn; the LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away,"
Exodus,18,3,"and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for Moses said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,18,4,"The other was named Eliezer, for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”"
Exodus,18,5,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of God."
Exodus,18,6,"He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.”"
Exodus,18,7,"Then Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them."
Exodus,18,9,"Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,10,"So Jethro said, “Blessed be the LORD who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people.”"
Exodus,18,12,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God."
Exodus,18,13,"It came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning until the evening."
Exodus,18,14,"Now when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God."
Exodus,18,16,"When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and make known the statutes of God and His laws.”"
Exodus,18,17,"Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good."
Exodus,18,18,"You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone."
Exodus,18,19,"Now listen to me: I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You be the people’s representative before God, and you bring the disputes to God,"
Exodus,18,20,"then teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk and the work they are to do."
Exodus,18,21,"Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place these over them as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens."
Exodus,18,22,"Let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.”"
Exodus,18,24,So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Exodus,18,25,"Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens."
Exodus,18,26,"They judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Moses, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge."
Exodus,18,27,"Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land."
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel:"
Exodus,19,4,"‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to Myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;"
Exodus,19,6,and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.”
Exodus,19,7,"So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,19,8,"All the people answered together and said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do!” And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD."
Exodus,19,9,"The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also believe in you forever.” Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD."
Exodus,19,10,"The LORD also said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments;"
Exodus,19,11,"and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."
Exodus,19,12,"You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, ‘Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,19,13,"No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.”"
Exodus,19,14,"So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they washed their garments."
Exodus,19,15,"He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.”"
Exodus,19,16,"So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,"And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently."
Exodus,19,19,"When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder."
Exodus,19,20,"The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up."
Exodus,19,21,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish."
Exodus,19,22,"Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, or else the LORD will break out against them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds about the mountain and consecrate it.’”"
Exodus,19,24,"Then the LORD said to him, “Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break forth upon them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus,20,1,"Then God spoke all these words, saying,"
Exodus,20,2,"“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Exodus,20,3,“You shall have no other gods before Me.
Exodus,20,4,"“You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth."
Exodus,20,5,"You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Exodus,20,6,"but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments."
Exodus,20,7,"“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain."
Exodus,20,8,"“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
Exodus,20,9,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you."
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy."
Exodus,20,12,"“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you."
Exodus,20,13,“You shall not murder.
Exodus,20,14,“You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,“You shall not steal.
Exodus,20,16,“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
Exodus,20,18,"All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance."
Exodus,20,19,"Then they said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, or we will die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,"So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,"You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves."
Exodus,20,24,"You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it."
Exodus,20,26,"And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.’"
Exodus,21,1,“Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them:
Exodus,21,2,"“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment."
Exodus,21,3,"If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone."
Exodus,21,5,"But if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,’"
Exodus,21,6,"then his master shall bring him to God, then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him permanently."
Exodus,21,7,"“If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her."
Exodus,21,9,"If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters."
Exodus,21,10,"If he takes to himself another woman, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights."
Exodus,21,11,"If he will not do these three things for her, then she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money."
Exodus,21,12,“He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,"But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee."
Exodus,21,14,"If, however, a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to kill him craftily, you are to take him even from My altar, that he may die."

Exodus,21,20,"“If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished."
Exodus,21,21,"If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property."
Exodus,21,22,"“If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely, yet there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman’s husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide."
Exodus,21,23,"But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life,"
Exodus,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"

Exodus,22,9,"For every breach of trust, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any lost thing about which one says, ‘This is it,’ the case of both parties shall come before the judges; he whom the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor."
Exodus,22,10,"“If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep for him, and it dies or is hurt or is driven away while no one is looking,"
Exodus,22,11,"an oath before the LORD shall be made by the two of them that he has not laid hands on his neighbor’s property; and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution."

Exodus,22,25,"“If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act as a creditor to him; you shall not charge him interest."
Exodus,22,26,"If you ever take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets,"

Exodus,23,31,"I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River Euphrates; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you."
Exodus,23,32,You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
Exodus,23,33,"They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”"
Exodus,24,1,"Then He said to Moses, “Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance."
Exodus,24,2,"Moses alone, however, shall come near to the LORD, but they shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him.”"
Exodus,24,3,"Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do!”"
Exodus,24,4,"Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel."
Exodus,24,5,"He sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD."
Exodus,24,6,"Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar."
Exodus,24,7,"Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!”"
Exodus,24,8,"So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”"
Exodus,24,9,"Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,"
Exodus,24,10,"and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself."
Exodus,24,11,"Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank."
Exodus,24,12,"Now the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction.”"
Exodus,24,13,"So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God."
Exodus,24,14,"But to the elders he said, “Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them.”"
Exodus,24,15,"Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain."
Exodus,24,16,"The glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud."
Exodus,24,17,And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountain top.
Exodus,24,18,Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Exodus,25,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,25,2,“Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for Me; from every man whose heart moves him you shall raise My contribution.

Exodus,25,11,"You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and you shall make a gold molding around it."
Exodus,25,12,"You shall cast four gold rings for it and fasten them on its four feet, and two rings shall be on one side of it and two rings on the other side of it."
Exodus,25,13,You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
Exodus,25,14,"You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark with them."
Exodus,25,15,The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it.
Exodus,25,16,You shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.
Exodus,25,17,"“You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide."
Exodus,25,18,"You shall make two cherubim of gold, make them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat."

Exodus,25,20,"The cherubim shall have their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings and facing one another; the faces of the cherubim are to be turned toward the mercy seat."
Exodus,25,21,"You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I will give to you."
Exodus,25,22,"There I will meet with you; and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about all that I will give you in commandment for the sons of Israel."
Exodus,25,23,"“You shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long and one cubit wide and one and a half cubits high."
Exodus,25,24,You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold border around it.
Exodus,25,25,You shall make for it a rim of a handbreadth around it; and you shall make a gold border for the rim around it.
Exodus,25,26,You shall make four gold rings for it and put rings on the four corners which are on its four feet.
Exodus,25,27,The rings shall be close to the rim as holders for the poles to carry the table.
Exodus,25,28,"You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that with them the table may be carried."

Exodus,31,10,"the woven garments as well, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, with which to carry on their priesthood;"
Exodus,31,11,"the anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the holy place, they are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.”"
Exodus,31,12,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,31,13,"“But as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘You shall surely observe My sabbaths; for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you."
Exodus,31,14,"Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people."
Exodus,31,15,"For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,31,16,"So the sons of Israel shall observe the sabbath, to celebrate the sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.’"
Exodus,31,17,"It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased from labor, and was refreshed.”"
Exodus,31,18,"When He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God."
Exodus,32,1,"Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron and said to him, “Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron said to them, “Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”"
Exodus,32,3,Then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, “This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,32,5,"Now when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.”"
Exodus,32,6,"So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play."
Exodus,32,7,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves."
Exodus,32,8,"They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’”"
Exodus,32,9,"The LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people."
Exodus,32,10,"Now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation.”"
Exodus,32,11,"Then Moses entreated the LORD his God, and said, “O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.
Exodus,32,15,"Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one side and the other."
Exodus,32,16,"The tablets were God’s work, and the writing was God’s writing engraved on the tablets."
Exodus,32,17,"Now when Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of war in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,"But he said, “It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, Nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat; But the sound of singing I hear.”"
Exodus,32,19,"It came about, as soon as Moses came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses’ anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,"He took the calf which they had made and burned it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it over the surface of the water and made the sons of Israel drink it."
Exodus,32,21,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought such great sin upon them?”"
Exodus,32,22,"Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil."
Exodus,32,23,"For they said to me, ‘Make a god for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’"
Exodus,32,24,"I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.’ So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”"
Exodus,32,25,Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control—for Aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies—
Exodus,32,26,"then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him."
Exodus,32,27,"He said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Every man of you put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.’”"
Exodus,32,28,"So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day."
Exodus,32,29,"Then Moses said, “Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD—for every man has been against his son and against his brother—in order that He may bestow a blessing upon you today.”"
Exodus,32,30,"On the next day Moses said to the people, “You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to the LORD, perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"Then Moses returned to the LORD, and said, “Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves."
Exodus,32,32,"But now, if You will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out from Your book which You have written!”"
Exodus,32,33,"The LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book."
Exodus,32,34,"But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,"Then the LORD smote the people, because of what they did with the calf which Aaron had made."
Exodus,33,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’"
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite."
Exodus,33,3,"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are an obstinate people, and I might destroy you on the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard this sad word, they went into mourning, and none of them put on his ornaments."
Exodus,33,5,"For the LORD had said to Moses, “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘You are an obstinate people; should I go up in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you. Now therefore, put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what I shall do with you.’”"
Exodus,33,6,"So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward."
Exodus,33,7,"Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"And it came about, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he entered the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and the LORD would speak with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and worship, each at the entrance of his tent."
Exodus,33,11,"Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Then Moses said to the LORD, “See, You say to me, ‘Bring up this people!’ But You Yourself have not let me know whom You will send with me. Moreover, You have said, ‘I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.’"
Exodus,33,13,"Now therefore, I pray You, if I have found favor in Your sight, let me know Your ways that I may know You, so that I may find favor in Your sight. Consider too, that this nation is Your people.”"
Exodus,33,14,"And He said, “My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.”"
Exodus,33,15,"Then he said to Him, “If Your presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here."
Exodus,33,16,"For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, may be distinguished from all the other people who are upon the face of the earth?”"
Exodus,33,17,"The LORD said to Moses, “I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight and I have known you by name.”"
Exodus,33,18,"Then Moses said, “I pray You, show me Your glory!”"
Exodus,33,19,"And He said, “I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.”"
Exodus,33,20,"But He said, “You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!”"
Exodus,33,21,"Then the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock;"
Exodus,33,22,"and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,"Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen.”"
Exodus,34,1,"Now the LORD said to Moses, “Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered."
Exodus,34,2,"So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain."
Exodus,34,3,"No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain.”"
Exodus,34,4,"So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand."
Exodus,34,5,The LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD.
Exodus,34,6,"Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth;"
Exodus,34,7,"who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.”"
Exodus,34,8,Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship.
Exodus,34,9,"He said, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your own possession.”"
Exodus,34,10,"Then God said, “Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the LORD, for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you."
Exodus,34,11,"“Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite."
Exodus,34,12,"Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare in your midst."
Exodus,34,13,"But rather, you are to tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim"
Exodus,34,14,"—for you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God—"
Exodus,34,15,"otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice,"
Exodus,34,16,"and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters might play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons also to play the harlot with their gods."
Exodus,34,17,You shall make for yourself no molten gods.
Exodus,34,18,"“You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,"“The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me, and all your male livestock, the first offspring from cattle and sheep."
Exodus,34,20,"You shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from a donkey; and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. None shall appear before Me empty-handed."
Exodus,34,21,"“You shall work six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during plowing time and harvest you shall rest."
Exodus,34,22,"You shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, that is, the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year."
Exodus,34,23,"Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,"For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God."
Exodus,34,25,"“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor is the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover to be left over until morning."
Exodus,34,26,“You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. “You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
Exodus,34,27,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”"
Exodus,34,28,"So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments."
Exodus,34,29,"It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses’ hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him."
Exodus,34,30,"So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him."
Exodus,34,31,"Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them."
Exodus,34,32,"Afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them to do everything that the LORD had spoken to him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face."
Exodus,34,34,"But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out; and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded,"
Exodus,34,35,"the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone. So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him."
Exodus,35,1,"Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, “These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:"
Exodus,35,2,"“For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy day, a sabbath of complete rest to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death."
Exodus,35,3,You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day.”
Exodus,35,4,"Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying,"
Exodus,35,5,"‘Take from among you a contribution to the LORD; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as the LORD’S contribution: gold, silver, and bronze,"
Exodus,35,6,"and blue, purple and scarlet material, fine linen, goats’ hair,"
Exodus,35,7,"and rams’ skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,"
Exodus,35,8,"and oil for lighting, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense,"
Exodus,35,9,and onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,"‘Let every skillful man among you come, and make all that the LORD has commanded:"
Exodus,35,11,"the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;"
Exodus,35,12,"the ark and its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain of the screen;"
Exodus,35,13,"the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;"
Exodus,35,14,the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for the light;
Exodus,35,15,"and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle;"
Exodus,35,16,"the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;"
Exodus,35,17,"the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;"
Exodus,35,18,the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords;
Exodus,35,19,"the woven garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.’”"
Exodus,35,20,Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses’ presence.
Exodus,35,21,Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the LORD’S contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.
Exodus,35,22,"Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so did every man who presented an offering of gold to the LORD."
Exodus,35,23,"Every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet material and fine linen and goats’ hair and rams’ skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them."
Exodus,35,24,Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the LORD’S contribution; and every man who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service brought it.
Exodus,35,25,"All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, in blue and purple and scarlet material and in fine linen."
Exodus,35,26,All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats’ hair.
Exodus,35,27,The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece;
Exodus,35,28,and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
Exodus,35,29,"The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring material for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD."
Exodus,35,30,"Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,35,31,"And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship;"
Exodus,35,32,"to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze,"
Exodus,35,33,"and in the cutting of stones for settings and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work."
Exodus,35,34,"He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan."
Exodus,35,35,"He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs."
Exodus,36,1,"“Now Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful person in whom the LORD has put skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the construction of the sanctuary, shall perform in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.”"
Exodus,36,2,"Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful person in whom the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it."
Exodus,36,3,They received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary. And they still continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
Exodus,36,4,"And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work which he was performing,"
Exodus,36,5,"and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the LORD commanded us to perform.”"
Exodus,36,6,"So Moses issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, “Let no man or woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary.” Thus the people were restrained from bringing any more."
Exodus,36,7,"For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it."
Exodus,36,8,"All the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet material, with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman, Bezalel made them."
Exodus,36,9,The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements.
Exodus,36,10,He joined five curtains to one another and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
Exodus,36,11,He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.
Exodus,36,12,He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other.
Exodus,36,13,"He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was a unit."
Exodus,36,14,Then he made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all.
Exodus,36,15,The length of each curtain was thirty cubits and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had the same measurements.
Exodus,36,16,He joined five curtains by themselves and the other six curtains by themselves.
Exodus,36,17,"Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the first set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set."
Exodus,36,18,He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it would be a unit.
Exodus,36,19,"He made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above."
Exodus,36,20,"Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright."
Exodus,36,21,Ten cubits was the length of each board and one and a half cubits the width of each board.
Exodus,36,22,"There were two tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle."
Exodus,36,23,He made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side;
Exodus,36,24,and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
Exodus,36,25,"Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,"
Exodus,36,26,and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
Exodus,36,27,"For the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards."
Exodus,36,28,He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
Exodus,36,29,"They were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners."
Exodus,36,30,"There were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board."
Exodus,36,31,"Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle,"
Exodus,36,32,"and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear side to the west."
Exodus,36,33,He made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.
Exodus,36,34,"He overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold."
Exodus,36,35,"Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman."
Exodus,36,36,"He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them."
Exodus,36,37,"He made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver;"
Exodus,36,38,"and he made its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five sockets were of bronze."
Exodus,37,1,"Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits;"
Exodus,37,2,"and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around."
Exodus,37,3,"He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it."
Exodus,37,4,He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus,37,5,"He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry it."
Exodus,37,6,"He made a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide."
Exodus,37,7,He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat;
Exodus,37,8,one cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at the two ends.
Exodus,37,9,"The cherubim had their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat."
Exodus,37,10,"Then he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high."
Exodus,37,11,"He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around."
Exodus,37,12,"He made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around."
Exodus,37,13,He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.
Exodus,37,14,"Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table."
Exodus,37,15,"He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table."
Exodus,37,16,"He made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out drink offerings, of pure gold."
Exodus,37,17,"Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were of one piece with it."
Exodus,37,18,There were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it;
Exodus,37,19,"three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand."
Exodus,37,20,"In the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs and its flowers;"
Exodus,37,21,"and a bulb was under the first pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the second pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the third pair of branches coming out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand."
Exodus,37,22,Their bulbs and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was a single hammered work of pure gold.
Exodus,37,23,He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.
Exodus,37,24,He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
Exodus,37,25,"Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high; its horns were of one piece with it."
Exodus,37,26,"He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around."
Exodus,37,27,"He made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides—on opposite sides—as holders for poles with which to carry it."
Exodus,37,28,He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus,37,29,"And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer."
Exodus,38,1,"Then he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, square, and three cubits high."
Exodus,38,2,"He made its horns on its four corners, its horns being of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze."
Exodus,38,3,"He made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze."

Exodus,38,6,He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
Exodus,38,7,"He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks."
Exodus,38,8,"Moreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Exodus,38,9,"Then he made the court: for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits;"
Exodus,38,10,"their twenty pillars, and their twenty sockets, made of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver."

Exodus,38,21,"This is the number of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were numbered according to the command of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Exodus,38,22,"Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,38,23,"With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and a weaver in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and fine linen."
Exodus,38,24,"All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the wave offering, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary."
Exodus,38,25,"The silver of those of the congregation who were numbered was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;"

Exodus,38,27,"The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket."
Exodus,38,28,"Of the 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and made bands for them."
Exodus,38,29,"The bronze of the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels."

Exodus,38,31,"and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around."
Exodus,39,1,"Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet material, they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place as well as the holy garments which were for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,2,"He made the ephod of gold, and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen."
Exodus,39,3,"Then they hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads to be woven in with the blue and the purple and the scarlet material, and the fine linen, the work of a skillful workman."
Exodus,39,4,They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two upper ends.
Exodus,39,5,"The skillfully woven band which was on it was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,6,"They made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree settings; they were engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel."
Exodus,39,7,"And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,8,"He made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen."
Exodus,39,9,"It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double."
Exodus,39,10,"And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row was a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald;"
Exodus,39,11,"and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond;"
Exodus,39,12,"and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;"
Exodus,39,13,"and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree settings when they were mounted."
Exodus,39,14,"The stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, engraved with the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes."
Exodus,39,15,"They made on the breastpiece chains like cords, of twisted cordage work in pure gold."
Exodus,39,16,"They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece."
Exodus,39,17,Then they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece.
Exodus,39,18,"They put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it."
Exodus,39,19,"They made two gold rings and placed them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod."
Exodus,39,20,"Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod."
Exodus,39,21,"They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,22,"Then he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;"
Exodus,39,23,"and the opening of the robe was at the top in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, so that it would not be torn."
Exodus,39,24,They made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material and twisted linen on the hem of the robe.
Exodus,39,25,"They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe,"
Exodus,39,26,"alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe for the service, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,27,"They made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons,"
Exodus,39,28,"and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated caps of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twisted linen,"
Exodus,39,29,"and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue and purple and scarlet material, the work of the weaver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,30,"They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, “Holy to the LORD.”"
Exodus,39,31,"They fastened a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,39,32,Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed; and the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
Exodus,39,33,"They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars and its sockets;"
Exodus,39,34,"and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of porpoise skins, and the screening veil;"
Exodus,39,35,the ark of the testimony and its poles and the mercy seat;
Exodus,39,36,"the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;"
Exodus,39,37,"the pure gold lampstand, with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;"
Exodus,39,38,"and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the veil for the doorway of the tent;"
Exodus,39,39,"the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the laver and its stand;"
Exodus,39,40,"the hangings for the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;"
Exodus,39,41,"the woven garments for ministering in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests."
Exodus,39,42,So the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus,39,43,"And Moses examined all the work and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, this they had done. So Moses blessed them."
Exodus,40,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Exodus,40,2,“On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus,40,3,"You shall place the ark of the testimony there, and you shall screen the ark with the veil."
Exodus,40,4,You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps.
Exodus,40,5,"Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,6,You shall set the altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus,40,7,You shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.
Exodus,40,8,You shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court.
Exodus,40,9,"Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy."
Exodus,40,10,"You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, and the altar shall be most holy."
Exodus,40,11,"You shall anoint the laver and its stand, and consecrate it."
Exodus,40,12,Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
Exodus,40,13,"You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister as a priest to Me."
Exodus,40,14,You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them;
Exodus,40,15,"and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father, that they may minister as priests to Me; and their anointing will qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”"
Exodus,40,16,"Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did."
Exodus,40,17,"Now in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected."
Exodus,40,18,"Moses erected the tabernacle and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and inserted its bars and erected its pillars."
Exodus,40,19,"He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,20,"Then he took the testimony and put it into the ark, and attached the poles to the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark."
Exodus,40,21,"He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up a veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,22,"Then he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil."
Exodus,40,23,"He set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,24,"Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,25,"He lighted the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,26,Then he placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil;
Exodus,40,27,"and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,28,Then he set up the veil for the doorway of the tabernacle.
Exodus,40,29,"He set the altar of burnt offering before the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,30,He placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
Exodus,40,31,From it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
Exodus,40,32,"When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,33,"He erected the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the veil for the gateway of the court. Thus Moses finished the work."
Exodus,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,35,"Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,36,"Throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would set out;"
Exodus,40,37,"but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up."
Exodus,40,38,"For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel."
Leviticus,1,1,"Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,"
Leviticus,1,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock."
Leviticus,1,3,"If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer it, a male without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD."
Leviticus,1,4,"He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, that it may be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf."
Leviticus,1,5,He shall slay the young bull before the LORD; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,1,6,He shall then skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus,1,7,The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
Leviticus,1,8,"Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head and the suet over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar."
Leviticus,1,9,"Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,10,"‘But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without defect."
Leviticus,1,11,"He shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,1,12,"He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar."
Leviticus,1,13,"The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,14,"‘But if his offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering from the turtledoves or from young pigeons."
Leviticus,1,15,"The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar."
Leviticus,1,16,"He shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar eastward, to the place of the ashes."
Leviticus,1,17,"Then he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not sever it. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,1,"‘Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it."
Leviticus,2,2,"He shall then bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all of its frankincense. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,3,"The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy, of the offerings to the LORD by fire."
Leviticus,2,4,"‘Now when you bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"If your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil;"
Leviticus,2,6,you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,7,"Now if your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"When you bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to the LORD, it shall be presented to the priest and he shall bring it to the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"The priest then shall take up from the grain offering its memorial portion, and shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,10,The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy of the offerings to the LORD by fire.
Leviticus,2,11,"‘No grain offering, which you bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven, for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,12,"As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to the LORD, but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar."
Leviticus,2,13,"Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt."
Leviticus,2,14,"‘Also if you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the LORD, you shall bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, grits of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened things."
Leviticus,2,15,You shall then put oil on it and lay incense on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,16,"The priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion, part of its grits and its oil with all its incense as an offering by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,1,"‘Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he is going to offer out of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,2,"He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,3,"From the sacrifice of the peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,4,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,5,"Then Aaron’s sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,6,"But if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD is from the flock, he shall offer it, male or female, without defect."
Leviticus,3,7,"If he is going to offer a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the LORD,"
Leviticus,3,8,"and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it before the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,9,"From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall bring as an offering by fire to the LORD, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,10,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,11,"Then the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,12,"‘Moreover, if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD,"
Leviticus,3,13,"and he shall lay his hand on its head and slay it before the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,14,"From it he shall present his offering as an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,15,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,16,"The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire for a soothing aroma; all fat is the LORD’S."
Leviticus,3,17,It is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you shall not eat any fat or any blood.’”
Leviticus,4,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,4,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a person sins unintentionally in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and commits any of them,"
Leviticus,4,3,"if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer to the LORD a bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed."
Leviticus,4,4,"He shall bring the bull to the doorway of the tent of meeting before the LORD, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slay the bull before the LORD."
Leviticus,4,5,"Then the anointed priest is to take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the tent of meeting,"
Leviticus,4,6,"and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,4,7,The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which is before the LORD in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,8,"He shall remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,4,9,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys"
Leviticus,4,10,"(just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings), and the priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,11,"But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse,"
Leviticus,4,12,"that is, all the rest of the bull, he is to bring out to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned."
Leviticus,4,13,"‘Now if the whole congregation of Israel commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty;"
Leviticus,4,14,"when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,4,15,"Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be slain before the LORD."
Leviticus,4,16,Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting;
Leviticus,4,17,"and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil."
Leviticus,4,18,He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,19,He shall remove all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus,4,20,"He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,21,Then he is to bring out the bull to a place outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
Leviticus,4,22,"‘When a leader sins and unintentionally does any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty,"
Leviticus,4,23,"if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without defect."
Leviticus,4,24,He shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slay it in the place where they slay the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus,4,25,Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,26,"All its fat he shall offer up in smoke on the altar as in the case of the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,27,"‘Now if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty,"
Leviticus,4,28,"if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he has committed."
Leviticus,4,29,He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,30,The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,31,"Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,32,"‘But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without defect."
Leviticus,4,33,He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,34,"The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,35,"Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,1,"‘Now if a person sins after he hears a public adjuration to testify when he is a witness, whether he has seen or otherwise known, if he does not tell it, then he will bear his guilt."
Leviticus,5,2,"Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast or the carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things, though it is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he will be guilty."
Leviticus,5,3,"Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort his uncleanness may be with which he becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty."
Leviticus,5,4,"Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, in whatever matter a man may speak thoughtlessly with an oath, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty in one of these."
Leviticus,5,5,"So it shall be when he becomes guilty in one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned."
Leviticus,5,6,"He shall also bring his guilt offering to the LORD for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin."
Leviticus,5,7,"‘But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD his guilt offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first that which is for the sin offering and shall nip its head at the front of its neck, but he shall not sever it."
Leviticus,5,9,"He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,10,"The second he shall then prepare as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed, and it will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,11,"‘But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it or place incense on it, for it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of the LORD by fire: it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,13,"So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest shall become the priest’s, like the grain offering.’”"
Leviticus,5,14,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,5,15,"“If a person acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against the LORD’S holy things, then he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation in silver by shekels, in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering."
Leviticus,5,16,"He shall make restitution for that which he has sinned against the holy thing, and shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,17,"“Now if a person sins and does any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, though he was unaware, still he is guilty and shall bear his punishment."
Leviticus,5,18,"He is then to bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his error in which he sinned unintentionally and did not know it, and it will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD.”
Leviticus,6,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,2,"“When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD, and deceives his companion in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted to him, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his companion,"
Leviticus,6,3,"or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do;"
Leviticus,6,4,"then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall restore what he took by robbery or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him or the lost thing which he found,"
Leviticus,6,5,or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering.
Leviticus,6,6,"Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering,"
Leviticus,6,7,"and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt.”"
Leviticus,6,8,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,9,"“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law for the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it."
Leviticus,6,10,"The priest is to put on his linen robe, and he shall put on undergarments next to his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire reduces the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,"Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place."
Leviticus,6,12,"The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it."
Leviticus,6,13,Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out.
Leviticus,6,14,‘Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar.
Leviticus,6,15,"Then one of them shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,16,What is left of it Aaron and his sons are to eat. It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place; they are to eat it in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,6,17,"It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering."
Leviticus,6,18,"Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to the LORD. Whoever touches them will become consecrated.’”"
Leviticus,6,19,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,20,"“This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the LORD on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening."
Leviticus,6,21,"It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is well stirred, you shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,22,The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons shall offer it. By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the LORD.
Leviticus,6,23,So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten.”
Leviticus,6,24,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,25,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slain the sin offering shall be slain before the LORD; it is most holy."
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,6,27,"Anyone who touches its flesh will become consecrated; and when any of its blood splashes on a garment, in a holy place you shall wash what was splashed on."
Leviticus,6,28,"Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water."
Leviticus,6,29,Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,30,But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus,7,1,‘Now this is the law of the guilt offering; it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,2,"In the place where they slay the burnt offering they are to slay the guilt offering, and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"Then he shall offer from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,"
Leviticus,7,4,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe on the liver he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,7,5,The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,7,"The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it."
Leviticus,7,8,"Also the priest who presents any man’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has presented."
Leviticus,7,9,"Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it."
Leviticus,7,10,"Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to all alike."
Leviticus,7,11,‘Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be presented to the LORD.
Leviticus,7,12,"If he offers it by way of thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of well stirred fine flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,7,13,"With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present his offering with cakes of leavened bread."
Leviticus,7,14,Of this he shall present one of every offering as a contribution to the LORD; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,15,"‘Now as for the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings, it shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it over until morning."
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what is left of it may be eaten;"
Leviticus,7,17,but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,"So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings should ever be eaten on the third day, he who offers it will not be accepted, and it will not be reckoned to his benefit. It shall be an offensive thing, and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity."
Leviticus,7,19,"‘Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat such flesh."
Leviticus,7,20,"But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, in his uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,21,"When anyone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, that person shall be cut off from his people.’”"
Leviticus,7,22,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,7,23,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘You shall not eat any fat from an ox, a sheep or a goat."
Leviticus,7,24,"Also the fat of an animal which dies and the fat of an animal torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but you must certainly not eat it."
Leviticus,7,25,"For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is offered to the LORD, even the person who eats shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,26,"You are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal, in any of your dwellings."
Leviticus,7,27,"Any person who eats any blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people.’”"
Leviticus,7,28,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,7,29,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,30,"His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to the LORD. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be presented as a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,7,31,"The priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons."
Leviticus,7,32,You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,33,"The one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as his portion."
Leviticus,7,34,"For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their due forever from the sons of Israel."
Leviticus,7,35,"‘This is that which is consecrated to Aaron and that which is consecrated to his sons from the offerings by fire to the LORD, in that day when he presented them to serve as priests to the LORD."
Leviticus,7,36,These the LORD had commanded to be given them from the sons of Israel in the day that He anointed them. It is their due forever throughout their generations.’”
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings,"
Leviticus,7,38,which the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to present their offerings to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus,8,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,8,2,"“Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread,"
Leviticus,8,3,and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting.”
Leviticus,8,4,"So Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of meeting,"
Leviticus,8,5,"Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded to do.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and washed them with water.
Leviticus,8,7,"He put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he tied it to him."
Leviticus,8,8,"He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim."
Leviticus,8,9,"He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,"Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them."
Leviticus,8,11,"He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them."
Leviticus,8,12,"Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him."
Leviticus,8,13,"Next Moses had Aaron’s sons come near and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,"Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering."
Leviticus,8,15,"Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it."
Leviticus,8,16,"He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,"Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,19,Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
Leviticus,8,20,"When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke."
Leviticus,8,21,"After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,23,"Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"He also had Aaron’s sons come near; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,8,25,"He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,26,"From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer, and placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,27,He then put all these on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons and presented them as a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus,8,28,Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus,8,29,"Moses also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,30,"So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him."
Leviticus,8,31,"Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’"
Leviticus,8,32,The remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire.
Leviticus,8,33,"You shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days."
Leviticus,8,34,"The LORD has commanded to do as has been done this day, to make atonement on your behalf."
Leviticus,8,35,"At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you will not die, for so I have been commanded.”"
Leviticus,8,36,Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD had commanded through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus,9,2,"and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without defect, and offer them before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,3,"Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, for a burnt offering,"
Leviticus,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD will appear to you.’”"
Leviticus,9,5,"So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,6,"Moses said, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"Moses then said to Aaron, “Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering for the people, that you may make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
Leviticus,9,9,"Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put some on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,9,10,"The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering, he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,"The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp."
Leviticus,9,12,Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
Leviticus,9,13,"They handed the burnt offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,"He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar."
Leviticus,9,15,"Then he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first."
Leviticus,9,16,"He also presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance."
Leviticus,9,17,"Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning."
Leviticus,9,18,"Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, and the fat covering, and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver,"
Leviticus,9,20,they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus,9,21,"But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,"Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
Leviticus,10,1,"Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them."
Leviticus,10,2,"And fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what the LORD spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored.’” So Aaron, therefore, kept silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp.”"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you will not die and that He will not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the burning which the LORD has brought about."
Leviticus,10,7,"You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, or you will die; for the LORD’S anointing oil is upon you.” So they did according to the word of Moses."
Leviticus,10,8,"The LORD then spoke to Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,10,9,"“Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die—it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations—"
Leviticus,10,10,"and so as to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,"
Leviticus,10,11,and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them through Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12,"Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that is left over from the LORD’S offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy."
Leviticus,10,13,"You shall eat it, moreover, in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due out of the LORD’S offerings by fire; for thus I have been commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,"The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons’ due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel."
Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering before the LORD; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you, just as the LORD has commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,16,"But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying,"
Leviticus,10,17,"“Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,19,"But Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. When things like these happened to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of the LORD?”"
Leviticus,10,20,"When Moses heard that, it seemed good in his sight."
Leviticus,11,1,"The LORD spoke again to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,"
Leviticus,11,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘These are the creatures which you may eat from all the animals that are on the earth."
Leviticus,11,3,"Whatever divides a hoof, thus making split hoofs, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat."
Leviticus,11,4,"Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these, among those which chew the cud, or among those which divide the hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,5,"Likewise, the shaphan, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;"
Leviticus,11,6,"the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;"
Leviticus,11,7,"and the pig, for though it divides the hoof, thus making a split hoof, it does not chew cud, it is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,8,You shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,9,"‘These you may eat, whatever is in the water: all that have fins and scales, those in the water, in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat."
Leviticus,11,10,"But whatever is in the seas and in the rivers that does not have fins and scales among all the teeming life of the water, and among all the living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable things to you,"
Leviticus,11,11,"and they shall be abhorrent to you; you may not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall detest."
Leviticus,11,12,Whatever in the water does not have fins and scales is abhorrent to you.
Leviticus,11,13,"‘These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they are abhorrent, not to be eaten: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard,"
Leviticus,11,14,"and the kite and the falcon in its kind,"
Leviticus,11,15,"every raven in its kind,"
Leviticus,11,16,"and the ostrich and the owl and the sea gull and the hawk in its kind,"
Leviticus,11,17,"and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl,"
Leviticus,11,18,"and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture,"
Leviticus,11,19,"and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,‘All the winged insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,21,Yet these you may eat among all the winged insects which walk on all fours: those which have above their feet jointed legs with which to jump on the earth.
Leviticus,11,22,"These of them you may eat: the locust in its kinds, and the devastating locust in its kinds, and the cricket in its kinds, and the grasshopper in its kinds."
Leviticus,11,23,But all other winged insects which are four-footed are detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,24,"‘By these, moreover, you will be made unclean: whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening,"
Leviticus,11,25,and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,26,"Concerning all the animals which divide the hoof but do not make a split hoof, or which do not chew cud, they are unclean to you: whoever touches them becomes unclean."
Leviticus,11,27,"Also whatever walks on its paws, among all the creatures that walk on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening,"
Leviticus,11,28,and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,29,"‘Now these are to you the unclean among the swarming things which swarm on the earth: the mole, and the mouse, and the great lizard in its kinds,"
Leviticus,11,30,"and the gecko, and the crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand reptile, and the chameleon."
Leviticus,11,31,These are to you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,32,"Also anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead becomes unclean, including any wooden article, or clothing, or a skin, or a sack—any article of which use is made—it shall be put in the water and be unclean until evening, then it becomes clean."
Leviticus,11,33,"As for any earthenware vessel into which one of them may fall, whatever is in it becomes unclean and you shall break the vessel."
Leviticus,11,34,"Any of the food which may be eaten, on which water comes, shall become unclean, and any liquid which may be drunk in every vessel shall become unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"Everything, moreover, on which part of their carcass may fall becomes unclean; an oven or a stove shall be smashed; they are unclean and shall continue as unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,36,"Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, though the one who touches their carcass shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"If a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to be sown, it is clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"Though if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,39,"‘Also if one of the animals dies which you have for food, the one who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,40,"He too, who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening, and the one who picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,41,"‘Now every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is detestable, not to be eaten."
Leviticus,11,42,"Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all fours, whatever has many feet, in respect to every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are detestable."
Leviticus,11,43,Do not render yourselves detestable through any of the swarming things that swarm; and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them so that you become unclean.
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth."
Leviticus,11,45,"For I am the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; thus you shall be holy, for I am holy.’”"
Leviticus,11,46,"This is the law regarding the animal and the bird, and every living thing that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth,"
Leviticus,11,47,"to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the edible creature and the creature which is not to be eaten."
Leviticus,12,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,12,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: ‘When a woman gives birth and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days, as in the days of her menstruation she shall be unclean."
Leviticus,12,3,On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,"Then she shall remain in the blood of her purification for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are completed."
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall remain in the blood of her purification for sixty-six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"‘When the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a one year old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering."
Leviticus,12,7,"Then he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, whether a male or a female."
Leviticus,12,8,"But if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”"
Leviticus,13,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,13,2,"“When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests."
Leviticus,13,3,"The priest shall look at the mark on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"The priest shall look at him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days."
Leviticus,13,6,"The priest shall look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and the mark has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"“But if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again to the priest."
Leviticus,13,8,"The priest shall look, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy."
Leviticus,13,9,"“When the infection of leprosy is on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,"The priest shall then look, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,"
Leviticus,13,11,"it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"If the leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of him who has the infection from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see,"
Leviticus,13,13,"then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; it has all turned white and he is clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"The priest shall look at the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy."
Leviticus,13,16,"Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest,"
Leviticus,13,17,"and the priest shall look at him, and behold, if the infection has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,18,"“When the body has a boil on its skin and it is healed,"
Leviticus,13,19,"and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white, bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest;"
Leviticus,13,20,"and the priest shall look, and behold, if it appears to be lower than the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it and it is not lower than the skin and is faded, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days;"
Leviticus,13,22,"and if it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is only the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"“Or if the body sustains in its skin a burn by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,"
Leviticus,13,25,"then the priest shall look at it. And if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn. Therefore, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest looks at it, and indeed, there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days;"
Leviticus,13,27,"and the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,28,"But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is only the scar of the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,"“Now if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard,"
Leviticus,13,30,"then the priest shall look at the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and there is thin yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard."
Leviticus,13,31,"But if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and indeed, it appears to be no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days."
Leviticus,13,32,"On the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection, and if the scale has not spread and no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the appearance of the scale is no deeper than the skin,"
Leviticus,13,33,"then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the priest shall isolate the person with the scale seven more days."
Leviticus,13,34,"Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale, and if the scale has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,"But if the scale spreads farther in the skin after his cleansing,"
Leviticus,13,36,"then the priest shall look at him, and if the scale has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellowish hair; he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"If in his sight the scale has remained, however, and black hair has grown in it, the scale has healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"“When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots,"
Leviticus,13,39,"then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies are a faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,40,"“Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,41,"If his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"But if on the bald head or the bald forehead, there occurs a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,"
Leviticus,13,44,"he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head."
Leviticus,13,45,"“As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’"
Leviticus,13,46,He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
Leviticus,13,47,"“When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment,"
Leviticus,13,48,"whether in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in any article made of leather,"
Leviticus,13,49,"if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest."
Leviticus,13,50,Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,"He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy, it is unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire."
Leviticus,13,53,"“But if the priest shall look, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather,"
Leviticus,13,54,then the priest shall order them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs and he shall quarantine it for seven more days.
Leviticus,13,55,"After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating away has produced bareness on the top or on the front of it."
Leviticus,13,56,"“Then if the priest looks, and if the mark has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether from the warp or from the woof;"
Leviticus,13,57,"and if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; the article with the mark shall be burned in the fire."
Leviticus,13,58,"The garment, whether the warp or the woof, or any article of leather from which the mark has departed when you washed it, it shall then be washed a second time and will be clean.”"
Leviticus,13,59,"This is the law for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean."
Leviticus,14,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,14,2,"“This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. Now he shall be brought to the priest,"
Leviticus,14,3,"and the priest shall go out to the outside of the camp. Thus the priest shall look, and if the infection of leprosy has been healed in the leper,"
Leviticus,14,4,then the priest shall give orders to take two live clean birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop for the one who is to be cleansed.
Leviticus,14,5,The priest shall also give orders to slay the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
Leviticus,14,6,"As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood and the scarlet string and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was slain over the running water."
Leviticus,14,7,"He shall then sprinkle seven times the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the live bird go free over the open field."
Leviticus,14,8,"The one to be cleansed shall then wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water and be clean. Now afterward, he may enter the camp, but he shall stay outside his tent for seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"It will be on the seventh day that he shall shave off all his hair: he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair. He shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and be clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"“Now on the eighth day he is to take two male lambs without defect, and a yearling ewe lamb without defect, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil;"
Leviticus,14,11,and the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man to be cleansed and the aforesaid before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,14,12,"Then the priest shall take the one male lamb and bring it for a guilt offering, with the log of oil, and present them as a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,13,"Next he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, at the place of the sanctuary—for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy."
Leviticus,14,14,"The priest shall then take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,14,15,"The priest shall also take some of the log of oil, and pour it into his left palm;"
Leviticus,14,16,"the priest shall then dip his right-hand finger into the oil that is in his left palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,17,"Of the remaining oil which is in his palm, the priest shall put some on the right ear lobe of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering;"
Leviticus,14,18,"while the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s palm, he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,19,"The priest shall next offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterward, he shall slaughter the burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,20,"The priest shall offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"“But if he is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil,"
Leviticus,14,22,"and two turtledoves or two young pigeons which are within his means, the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"Then the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,24,"The priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall offer them for a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,25,Next he shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus,14,26,The priest shall also pour some of the oil into his left palm;
Leviticus,14,27,and with his right-hand finger the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,28,"The priest shall then put some of the oil that is in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering."
Leviticus,14,29,"Moreover, the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s palm he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,30,"He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means."
Leviticus,14,31,"He shall offer what he can afford, the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. So the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed."
Leviticus,14,32,"This is the law for him in whom there is an infection of leprosy, whose means are limited for his cleansing.”"
Leviticus,14,33,"The LORD further spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:"
Leviticus,14,34,"“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a mark of leprosy on a house in the land of your possession,"
Leviticus,14,35,"then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘Something like a mark of leprosy has become visible to me in the house.’"
Leviticus,14,36,"The priest shall then command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to look at the mark, so that everything in the house need not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to look at the house."
Leviticus,14,37,"So he shall look at the mark, and if the mark on the walls of the house has greenish or reddish depressions and appears deeper than the surface,"
Leviticus,14,38,"then the priest shall come out of the house, to the doorway, and quarantine the house for seven days."
Leviticus,14,39,"The priest shall return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the mark has indeed spread in the walls of the house,"
Leviticus,14,40,then the priest shall order them to tear out the stones with the mark in them and throw them away at an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus,14,41,"He shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall dump the plaster that they scrape off at an unclean place outside the city."
Leviticus,14,42,"Then they shall take other stones and replace those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house."
Leviticus,14,43,"“If, however, the mark breaks out again in the house after he has torn out the stones and scraped the house, and after it has been replastered,"
Leviticus,14,44,"then the priest shall come in and make an inspection. If he sees that the mark has indeed spread in the house, it is a malignant mark in the house; it is unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"He shall therefore tear down the house, its stones, and its timbers, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall take them outside the city to an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,"Moreover, whoever goes into the house during the time that he has quarantined it, becomes unclean until evening."
Leviticus,14,47,"Likewise, whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes."
Leviticus,14,48,"“If, on the other hand, the priest comes in and makes an inspection and the mark has not indeed spread in the house after the house has been replastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the mark has not reappeared."
Leviticus,14,49,"To cleanse the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop,"
Leviticus,14,50,and he shall slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
Leviticus,14,51,"Then he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string, with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird as well as in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"He shall thus cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water, along with the live bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet string."
Leviticus,14,53,"However, he shall let the live bird go free outside the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.”"
Leviticus,14,54,"This is the law for any mark of leprosy—even for a scale,"
Leviticus,14,55,"and for the leprous garment or house,"
Leviticus,14,56,"and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot—"
Leviticus,14,57,to teach when they are unclean and when they are clean. This is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus,15,1,"The LORD also spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"This, moreover, shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: it is his uncleanness whether his body allows its discharge to flow or whether his body obstructs its discharge."
Leviticus,15,4,"Every bed on which the person with the discharge lies becomes unclean, and everything on which he sits becomes unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"Anyone, moreover, who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening;"
Leviticus,15,6,"and whoever sits on the thing on which the man with the discharge has been sitting, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,7,Also whoever touches the person with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,8,"Or if the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, he too shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,9,Every saddle on which the person with the discharge rides becomes unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"Whoever then touches any of the things which were under him shall be unclean until evening, and he who carries them shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,11,"Likewise, whomever the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,12,"However, an earthenware vessel which the person with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water."
Leviticus,15,13,"‘Now when the man with the discharge becomes cleansed from his discharge, then he shall count off for himself seven days for his cleansing; he shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water and will become clean."
Leviticus,15,14,"Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest;"
Leviticus,15,15,"and the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD because of his discharge."
Leviticus,15,16,"‘Now if a man has a seminal emission, he shall bathe all his body in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,17,"As for any garment or any leather on which there is seminal emission, it shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,18,"If a man lies with a woman so that there is a seminal emission, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,19,"‘When a woman has a discharge, if her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,20,"Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,21,Anyone who touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,22,Whoever touches any thing on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,23,"Whether it be on the bed or on the thing on which she is sitting, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"‘Now if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days, not at the period of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond that period, all the days of her impure discharge she shall continue as though in her menstrual impurity; she is unclean."
Leviticus,15,26,"Any bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her like her bed at menstruation; and every thing on which she sits shall be unclean, like her uncleanness at that time."
Leviticus,15,27,"Likewise, whoever touches them shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"When she becomes clean from her discharge, she shall count off for herself seven days; and afterward she will be clean."
Leviticus,15,29,"Then on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them in to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,15,30,The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on her behalf before the LORD because of her impure discharge.’
Leviticus,15,31,"“Thus you shall keep the sons of Israel separated from their uncleanness, so that they will not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is among them.”"
Leviticus,15,32,"This is the law for the one with a discharge, and for the man who has a seminal emission so that he is unclean by it,"
Leviticus,15,33,"and for the woman who is ill because of menstrual impurity, and for the one who has a discharge, whether a male or a female, or a man who lies with an unclean woman."
Leviticus,16,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had approached the presence of the LORD and died."
Leviticus,16,2,"The LORD said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter at any time into the holy place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark, or he will die; for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,3,Aaron shall enter the holy place with this: with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,"He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body, and he shall be girded with the linen sash and attired with the linen turban (these are holy garments). Then he shall bathe his body in water and put them on."
Leviticus,16,5,He shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,"Then Aaron shall offer the bull for the sin offering which is for himself, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household."
Leviticus,16,7,He shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,"Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for the scapegoat."
Leviticus,16,9,"Then Aaron shall offer the goat on which the lot for the LORD fell, and make it a sin offering."
Leviticus,16,10,"But the goat on which the lot for the scapegoat fell shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness as the scapegoat."
Leviticus,16,11,"“Then Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement for himself and for his household, and he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself."
Leviticus,16,12,"He shall take a firepan full of coals of fire from upon the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside the veil."
Leviticus,16,13,"He shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the ark of the testimony, otherwise he will die."
Leviticus,16,14,"Moreover, he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; also in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times."
Leviticus,16,15,"“Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,16,"He shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the impurities of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which abides with them in the midst of their impurities."
Leviticus,16,17,"When he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, no one shall be in the tent of meeting until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,"Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides."
Leviticus,16,19,"With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it, and from the impurities of the sons of Israel consecrate it."
Leviticus,16,20,"“When he finishes atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall offer the live goat."
Leviticus,16,21,"Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands in readiness."
Leviticus,16,22,The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus,16,23,"“Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there."
Leviticus,16,24,"He shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes, and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people."
Leviticus,16,25,Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,The one who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; then afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus,16,27,"But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and their refuse in the fire."
Leviticus,16,28,"Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, then afterward he shall come into the camp."
Leviticus,16,29,"“This shall be a permanent statute for you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall humble your souls and not do any work, whether the native, or the alien who sojourns among you;"
Leviticus,16,30,for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you; you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
Leviticus,16,31,"It is to be a sabbath of solemn rest for you, that you may humble your souls; it is a permanent statute."
Leviticus,16,32,"So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father’s place shall make atonement: he shall thus put on the linen garments, the holy garments,"
Leviticus,16,33,"and make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar. He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly."
Leviticus,16,34,"Now you shall have this as a permanent statute, to make atonement for the sons of Israel for all their sins once every year.” And just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so he did."
Leviticus,17,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,17,2,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD has commanded, saying,"
Leviticus,17,3,"“Any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp,"
Leviticus,17,4,"and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguiltiness is to be reckoned to that man. He has shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,5,"The reason is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing in the open field, that they may bring them in to the LORD, at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD."
Leviticus,17,6,"The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,17,7,They shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot. This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations.”’
Leviticus,17,8,"“Then you shall say to them, ‘Any man from the house of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,"
Leviticus,17,9,"and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man also shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,17,10,"‘And any man from the house of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,11,"For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.’"
Leviticus,17,12,"Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, ‘No person among you may eat blood, nor may any alien who sojourns among you eat blood.’"
Leviticus,17,13,"So when any man from the sons of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth."
Leviticus,17,14,"“For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, ‘You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.’"
Leviticus,17,15,"When any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or an alien, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean."
Leviticus,17,16,"But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he shall bear his guilt.”"
Leviticus,18,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,18,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,18,3,"You shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes."
Leviticus,18,4,"You are to perform My judgments and keep My statutes, to live in accord with them; I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,18,5,"So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, by which a man may live if he does them; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,18,6,‘None of you shall approach any blood relative of his to uncover nakedness; I am the LORD.
Leviticus,18,7,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you are not to uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,8,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness.
Leviticus,18,9,"The nakedness of your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether born at home or born outside, their nakedness you shall not uncover."
Leviticus,18,10,"The nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for their nakedness is yours."
Leviticus,18,11,"The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, born to your father, she is your sister, you shall not uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,12,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s blood relative.
Leviticus,18,13,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s blood relative."
Leviticus,18,14,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother; you shall not approach his wife, she is your aunt."
Leviticus,18,15,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,16,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness.
Leviticus,18,17,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, nor shall you take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness."
Leviticus,18,18,"You shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a rival while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,19,‘Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity.
Leviticus,18,20,"You shall not have intercourse with your neighbor’s wife, to be defiled with her."
Leviticus,18,21,"You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,18,22,You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.
Leviticus,18,23,"Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion."
Leviticus,18,24,‘Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
Leviticus,18,25,"For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants."
Leviticus,18,26,"But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you"
Leviticus,18,27,"(for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled);"
Leviticus,18,28,"so that the land will not spew you out, should you defile it, as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you."
Leviticus,18,29,"For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people."
Leviticus,18,30,"Thus you are to keep My charge, that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am the LORD your God.’”"
Leviticus,19,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
Leviticus,19,2,"“Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy."
Leviticus,19,3,"Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father, and you shall keep My sabbaths; I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,4,Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods; I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,19,5,"‘Now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted."
Leviticus,19,6,"It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire."
Leviticus,19,7,"So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an offense; it will not be accepted."
Leviticus,19,8,"Everyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,19,9,"‘Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest."
Leviticus,19,10,"Nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the needy and for the stranger. I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,11,"‘You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another."
Leviticus,19,12,"You shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,19,13,"‘You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning."
Leviticus,19,14,"You shall not curse a deaf man, nor place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall revere your God; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,19,15,"‘You shall do no injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly."
Leviticus,19,16,"You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you are not to act against the life of your neighbor; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,19,17,"‘You shall not hate your fellow countryman in your heart; you may surely reprove your neighbor, but shall not incur sin because of him."
Leviticus,19,18,"You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,19,19,"‘You are to keep My statutes. You shall not breed together two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together."
Leviticus,19,20,"‘Now if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death, because she was not free."
Leviticus,19,21,"He shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt offering."
Leviticus,19,22,"The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,19,23,"‘When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten."
Leviticus,19,24,"But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD."
Leviticus,19,25,"In the fifth year you are to eat of its fruit, that its yield may increase for you; I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,26,"‘You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor practice divination or soothsaying."
Leviticus,19,27,You shall not round off the side-growth of your heads nor harm the edges of your beard.
Leviticus,19,28,You shall not make any cuts in your body for the dead nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves: I am the LORD.
Leviticus,19,29,"‘Do not profane your daughter by making her a harlot, so that the land will not fall to harlotry and the land become full of lewdness."
Leviticus,19,30,You shall keep My sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am the LORD.
Leviticus,19,31,‘Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,19,32,"‘You shall rise up before the grayheaded and honor the aged, and you shall revere your God; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,19,33,"‘When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong."
Leviticus,19,34,"The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,35,"‘You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or capacity."
Leviticus,19,36,"You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin; I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt."
Leviticus,19,37,You shall thus observe all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them; I am the LORD.’”
Leviticus,20,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,20,2,"“You shall also say to the sons of Israel: ‘Any man from the sons of Israel or from the aliens sojourning in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones."
Leviticus,20,3,"I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name."
Leviticus,20,4,"If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death,"
Leviticus,20,5,"then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him, by playing the harlot after Molech."
Leviticus,20,6,"‘As for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists, to play the harlot after them, I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people."
Leviticus,20,7,"You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,20,8,You shall keep My statutes and practice them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
Leviticus,20,9,"‘If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his bloodguiltiness is upon him."
Leviticus,20,10,"‘If there is a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, one who commits adultery with his friend’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,20,11,"If there is a man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death, their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,12,"If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have committed incest, their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,13,"If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,14,"If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother, it is immorality; both he and they shall be burned with fire, so that there will be no immorality in your midst."
Leviticus,20,15,"If there is a man who lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death; you shall also kill the animal."
Leviticus,20,16,"If there is a woman who approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,17,"‘If there is a man who takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he bears his guilt."
Leviticus,20,18,"If there is a man who lies with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has exposed the flow of her blood; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people."
Leviticus,20,19,"You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister, for such a one has made naked his blood relative; they will bear their guilt."
Leviticus,20,20,If there is a man who lies with his uncle’s wife he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless.
Leviticus,20,21,"If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife, it is abhorrent; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They will be childless."
Leviticus,20,22,"‘You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out."
Leviticus,20,23,"Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them."
Leviticus,20,24,"Hence I have said to you, “You are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples."
Leviticus,20,25,"You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean."
Leviticus,20,26,"Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine."
Leviticus,20,27,"‘Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.’”"
Leviticus,21,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: ‘No one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people,"
Leviticus,21,2,"except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother and his father and his son and his daughter and his brother,"
Leviticus,21,3,"also for his virgin sister, who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself."
Leviticus,21,4,"He shall not defile himself as a relative by marriage among his people, and so profane himself."
Leviticus,21,5,"They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh."
Leviticus,21,6,"They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they present the offerings by fire to the LORD, the food of their God; so they shall be holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"They shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God."
Leviticus,21,8,"You shall consecrate him, therefore, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I the LORD, who sanctifies you, am holy."
Leviticus,21,9,"Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by harlotry, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire."
Leviticus,21,10,"‘The priest who is the highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes;"
Leviticus,21,11,"nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself even for his father or his mother;"
Leviticus,21,12,"nor shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,21,13,He shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus,21,14,"A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is profaned by harlotry, these he may not take; but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people,"
Leviticus,21,15,so that he will not profane his offspring among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.’”
Leviticus,21,16,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,21,17,"“Speak to Aaron, saying, ‘No man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect shall approach to offer the food of his God."
Leviticus,21,18,"For no one who has a defect shall approach: a blind man, or a lame man, or he who has a disfigured face, or any deformed limb,"
Leviticus,21,19,"or a man who has a broken foot or broken hand,"
Leviticus,21,20,"or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed testicles."
Leviticus,21,21,"No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a defect is to come near to offer the LORD’S offerings by fire; since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the food of his God."
Leviticus,21,22,"He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy,"
Leviticus,21,23,"only he shall not go in to the veil or come near the altar because he has a defect, so that he will not profane My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’”"
Leviticus,21,24,So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
Leviticus,22,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,2,"“Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to Me, so as not to profane My holy name; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,3,"Say to them, ‘If any man among all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy gifts which the sons of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from before Me; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,4,"No man of the descendants of Aaron, who is a leper or who has a discharge, may eat of the holy gifts until he is clean. And if one touches anything made unclean by a corpse or if a man has a seminal emission,"
Leviticus,22,5,"or if a man touches any teeming things by which he is made unclean, or any man by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness;"
Leviticus,22,6,"a person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy gifts unless he has bathed his body in water."
Leviticus,22,7,"But when the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he shall eat of the holy gifts, for it is his food."
Leviticus,22,8,"He shall not eat an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,9,"They shall therefore keep My charge, so that they will not bear sin because of it and die thereby because they profane it; I am the LORD who sanctifies them."
Leviticus,22,10,"‘No layman, however, is to eat the holy gift; a sojourner with the priest or a hired man shall not eat of the holy gift."
Leviticus,22,11,"But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money, that one may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his food."
Leviticus,22,12,"If a priest’s daughter is married to a layman, she shall not eat of the offering of the gifts."
Leviticus,22,13,"But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no child and returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s food; but no layman shall eat of it."
Leviticus,22,14,"But if a man eats a holy gift unintentionally, then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy gift to the priest."
Leviticus,22,15,"They shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel which they offer to the LORD,"
Leviticus,22,16,and so cause them to bear punishment for guilt by eating their holy gifts; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’”
Leviticus,22,17,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,18,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or of the aliens in Israel who presents his offering, whether it is any of their votive or any of their freewill offerings, which they present to the LORD for a burnt offering—"
Leviticus,22,19,"for you to be accepted—it must be a male without defect from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats."
Leviticus,22,20,"Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it will not be accepted for you."
Leviticus,22,21,"When a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a special vow or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it."
Leviticus,22,22,"Those that are blind or fractured or maimed or having a running sore or eczema or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,23,"In respect to an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member, you may present it for a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted."
Leviticus,22,24,"Also anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the LORD, or sacrifice in your land,"
Leviticus,22,25,"nor shall you accept any such from the hand of a foreigner for offering as the food of your God; for their corruption is in them, they have a defect, they shall not be accepted for you.’”"
Leviticus,22,26,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,22,27,"“When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,28,"But, whether it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not kill both it and its young in one day."
Leviticus,22,29,"When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted."
Leviticus,22,30,"It shall be eaten on the same day, you shall leave none of it until morning; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,31,"So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am the LORD."
Leviticus,22,32,"“You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel; I am the LORD who sanctifies you,"
Leviticus,22,33,"who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the LORD.”"
Leviticus,23,1,"The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD’S appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy convocations—My appointed times are these:"
Leviticus,23,3,"‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings."
Leviticus,23,4,"‘These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them."
Leviticus,23,5,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the LORD’S Passover."
Leviticus,23,6,Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus,23,7,On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.
Leviticus,23,8,But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.’”
Leviticus,23,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest."
Leviticus,23,11,He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD for you to be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus,23,12,"Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,13,"Its grain offering shall then be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the LORD for a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine."
Leviticus,23,14,"Until this same day, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places."
Leviticus,23,15,"‘You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete sabbaths."
Leviticus,23,16,You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD.
Leviticus,23,17,"You shall bring in from your dwelling places two loaves of bread for a wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,18,"Along with the bread you shall present seven one year old male lambs without defect, and a bull of the herd and two rams; they are to be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,19,You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male lambs one year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Leviticus,23,20,The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering with two lambs before the LORD; they are to be holy to the LORD for the priest.
Leviticus,23,21,On this same day you shall make a proclamation as well; you are to have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a perpetual statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.
Leviticus,23,22,"‘When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the needy and the alien. I am the LORD your God.’”"
Leviticus,23,23,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,24,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month on the first of the month you shall have a rest, a reminder by blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation."
Leviticus,23,25,"You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.’”"
Leviticus,23,26,"The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,27,"“On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble your souls and present an offering by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,28,"You shall not do any work on this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,29,"If there is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,23,30,"As for any person who does any work on this same day, that person I will destroy from among his people."
Leviticus,23,31,You shall do no work at all. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
Leviticus,23,32,"It is to be a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall humble your souls; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening you shall keep your sabbath.”"
Leviticus,23,33,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,34,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘On the fifteenth of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work of any kind.
Leviticus,23,36,For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD; it is an assembly. You shall do no laborious work.
Leviticus,23,37,"‘These are the appointed times of the LORD which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the LORD—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day’s matter on its own day—"
Leviticus,23,38,"besides those of the sabbaths of the LORD, and besides your gifts and besides all your votive and freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,39,"‘On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days, with a rest on the first day and a rest on the eighth day."
Leviticus,23,40,"Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,You shall thus celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,"You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths,"
Leviticus,23,43,so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’”
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the LORD.
Leviticus,24,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,2,"“Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually."
Leviticus,24,3,"Outside the veil of testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the LORD continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations."
Leviticus,24,4,He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.
Leviticus,24,5,“Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake.
Leviticus,24,6,"You shall set them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD."
Leviticus,24,7,"You shall put pure frankincense on each row that it may be a memorial portion for the bread, even an offering by fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,24,8,Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel.
Leviticus,24,9,"It shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the LORD’S offerings by fire, his portion forever.”"
Leviticus,24,10,"Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel; and the Israelite woman’s son and a man of Israel struggled with each other in the camp."
Leviticus,24,11,"The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)"
Leviticus,24,12,They put him in custody so that the command of the LORD might be made clear to them.
Leviticus,24,13,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,14,"“Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"You shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If anyone curses his God, then he will bear his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"Moreover, the one who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The alien as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,"‘If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,24,18,"The one who takes the life of an animal shall make it good, life for life."
Leviticus,24,19,"If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to him:"
Leviticus,24,20,"fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him."
Leviticus,24,21,"Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good, but the one who kills a man shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,"There shall be one standard for you; it shall be for the stranger as well as the native, for I am the LORD your God.’”"
Leviticus,24,23,"Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"The LORD then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying,"
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the LORD."
Leviticus,25,3,"Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop,"
Leviticus,25,4,"but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"Your harvest’s aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical year."
Leviticus,25,6,"All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food; yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you."
Leviticus,25,7,Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.
Leviticus,25,8,"‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.
Leviticus,25,10,"You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family."
Leviticus,25,11,"You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines."
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.
Leviticus,25,14,"If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend’s hand, you shall not wrong one another."
Leviticus,25,15,"Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops."
Leviticus,25,16,"In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of crops he is selling to you."
Leviticus,25,17,"So you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry them out, that you may live securely on the land."
Leviticus,25,19,"Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it."
Leviticus,25,20,"But if you say, “What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our crops?”"
Leviticus,25,21,then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years.
Leviticus,25,22,"When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop, eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in."
Leviticus,25,23,"‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me."
Leviticus,25,24,"Thus for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land."
Leviticus,25,25,"‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his relative has sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his means as to find sufficient for its redemption,"
Leviticus,25,27,"then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his property."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, that he may return to his property."
Leviticus,25,29,"‘Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year."
Leviticus,25,30,"But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"As for cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession."
Leviticus,25,33,"What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,"But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their perpetual possession."
Leviticus,25,35,"‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Do not take usurious interest from him, but revere your God, that your countryman may live with you."
Leviticus,25,37,"You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service."
Leviticus,25,40,"He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee."
Leviticus,25,41,"He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers."
Leviticus,25,42,For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale.
Leviticus,25,43,"You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God."
Leviticus,25,44,As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you.
Leviticus,25,45,"Then, too, it is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession."
Leviticus,25,46,"You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one another."
Leviticus,25,47,"‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the descendants of a stranger’s family,"
Leviticus,25,48,"then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him,"
Leviticus,25,49,"or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be with him.
Leviticus,25,51,"If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption;"
Leviticus,25,52,"and if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption."
Leviticus,25,53,Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule over him with severity in your sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"‘You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you set up for yourselves an image or a sacred pillar, nor shall you place a figured stone in your land to bow down to it; for I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,26,2,You shall keep My sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary; I am the LORD.
Leviticus,26,3,"If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them out,"
Leviticus,26,4,"then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Indeed, your threshing will last for you until grape gathering, and grape gathering will last until sowing time. You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land."
Leviticus,26,6,"I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down with no one making you tremble. I shall also eliminate harmful beasts from the land, and no sword will pass through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,But you will chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword;
Leviticus,26,8,"five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,You will eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new.
Leviticus,26,11,"Moreover, I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be their slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect."
Leviticus,26,14,"‘But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these commandments,"
Leviticus,26,15,"if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My covenant,"
Leviticus,26,16,"I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat it up."
Leviticus,26,17,"I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you."
Leviticus,26,18,"If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,I will also break down your pride of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze.
Leviticus,26,20,"Your strength will be spent uselessly, for your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"‘If then, you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will let loose among you the beasts of the field, which will bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that your roads lie deserted."
Leviticus,26,23,"‘And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with hostility against Me,"
Leviticus,26,24,"then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,"I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands."
Leviticus,26,26,"When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you will eat and not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"‘Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with hostility against Me,"
Leviticus,26,28,"then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,"Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters you will eat."
Leviticus,26,30,"I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul shall abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas."
Leviticus,26,32,I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over it.
Leviticus,26,33,"You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste."
Leviticus,26,34,"‘Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies’ land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths."
Leviticus,26,35,"All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it."
Leviticus,26,36,"As for those of you who may be left, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them, and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the sword, and they will fall."
Leviticus,26,37,"They will therefore stumble over each other as if running from the sword, although no one is pursuing; and you will have no strength to stand up before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies’ land will consume you."
Leviticus,26,39,So those of you who may be left will rot away because of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them.
Leviticus,26,40,"‘If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their forefathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also in their acting with hostility against Me—"
Leviticus,26,41,"I also was acting with hostility against them, to bring them into the land of their enemies—or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity,"
Leviticus,26,42,"then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"For the land will be abandoned by them, and will make up for its sabbaths while it is made desolate without them. They, meanwhile, will be making amends for their iniquity, because they rejected My ordinances and their soul abhorred My statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.’”"
Leviticus,26,46,These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the LORD established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai.
Leviticus,27,1,"Again, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man makes a difficult vow, he shall be valued according to your valuation of persons belonging to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,3,"If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,If it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus,27,6,"But if they are from a month even up to five years old, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"If they are from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him."
Leviticus,27,9,"‘Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the LORD, any such that one gives to the LORD shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall become holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"If, however, it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the LORD, then he shall place the animal before the priest."
Leviticus,27,12,"The priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,14,"‘Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"Yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"‘Again, if a man consecrates to the LORD part of the fields of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,18,"If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, however, then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation."
Leviticus,27,19,"If the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may pass to him."
Leviticus,27,20,"Yet if he will not redeem the field, but has sold the field to another man, it may no longer be redeemed;"
Leviticus,27,21,"and when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field set apart; it shall be for the priest as his property."
Leviticus,27,22,"Or if he consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of the field of his own property,"
Leviticus,27,23,then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the LORD.
Leviticus,27,24,"In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, to whom the possession of the land belongs."
Leviticus,27,25,"Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs."
Leviticus,27,26,"‘However, a firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may consecrate it; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD’S."
Leviticus,27,27,"But if it is among the unclean animals, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation and add to it one-fifth of it; and if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,28,"‘Nevertheless, anything which a man sets apart to the LORD out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the fields of his own property, shall not be sold or redeemed. Anything devoted to destruction is most holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,29,No one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,"‘Thus all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S; it is holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,31,"If, therefore, a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he shall add to it one-fifth of it."
Leviticus,27,32,"For every tenth part of herd or flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,33,"He is not to be concerned whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; or if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”"
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai.
Numbers,1,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
Numbers,1,2,"“Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head"
Numbers,1,3,"from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies."
Numbers,1,4,"With you, moreover, there shall be a man of each tribe, each one head of his father’s household."
Numbers,1,5,"These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;"
Numbers,1,6,"of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;"
Numbers,1,7,"of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;"
Numbers,1,8,"of Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar;"
Numbers,1,9,"of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;"
Numbers,1,10,"of the sons of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; of Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;"
Numbers,1,11,"of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni;"
Numbers,1,12,"of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;"
Numbers,1,13,"of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran;"
Numbers,1,14,"of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel;"
Numbers,1,15,"of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan."
Numbers,1,16,"These are they who were called of the congregation, the leaders of their fathers’ tribes; they were the heads of divisions of Israel.”"
Numbers,1,17,"So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,"
Numbers,1,18,"and they assembled all the congregation together on the first of the second month. Then they registered by ancestry in their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, head by head,"
Numbers,1,19,just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,1,20,"Now the sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,21,"their numbered men of the tribe of Reuben were 46,500."
Numbers,1,22,"Of the sons of Simeon, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, their numbered men, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,23,"their numbered men of the tribe of Simeon were 59,300."
Numbers,1,24,"Of the sons of Gad, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,25,"their numbered men of the tribe of Gad were 45,650."
Numbers,1,26,"Of the sons of Judah, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,27,"their numbered men of the tribe of Judah were 74,600."
Numbers,1,28,"Of the sons of Issachar, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,29,"their numbered men of the tribe of Issachar were 54,400."
Numbers,1,30,"Of the sons of Zebulun, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,31,"their numbered men of the tribe of Zebulun were 57,400."
Numbers,1,32,"Of the sons of Joseph, namely, of the sons of Ephraim, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,33,"their numbered men of the tribe of Ephraim were 40,500."
Numbers,1,34,"Of the sons of Manasseh, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,35,"their numbered men of the tribe of Manasseh were 32,200."
Numbers,1,36,"Of the sons of Benjamin, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,37,"their numbered men of the tribe of Benjamin were 35,400."
Numbers,1,38,"Of the sons of Dan, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,39,"their numbered men of the tribe of Dan were 62,700."
Numbers,1,40,"Of the sons of Asher, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,41,"their numbered men of the tribe of Asher were 41,500."
Numbers,1,42,"Of the sons of Naphtali, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,"
Numbers,1,43,"their numbered men of the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400."
Numbers,1,44,"These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each of whom was of his father’s household."
Numbers,1,45,"So all the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ households, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war in Israel,"
Numbers,1,46,"even all the numbered men were 603,550."
Numbers,1,47,"The Levites, however, were not numbered among them by their fathers’ tribe."
Numbers,1,48,"For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,1,49,"“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel."
Numbers,1,50,"But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it; they shall also camp around the tabernacle."
Numbers,1,51,"So when the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman who comes near shall be put to death."
Numbers,1,52,"The sons of Israel shall camp, each man by his own camp, and each man by his own standard, according to their armies."
Numbers,1,53,"But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there will be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.”"
Numbers,1,54,"Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all which the LORD had commanded Moses, so they did."
Numbers,2,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,2,2,"“The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ households; they shall camp around the tent of meeting at a distance."
Numbers,2,3,"Now those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab,"
Numbers,2,4,"and his army, even their numbered men, 74,600."
Numbers,2,5,"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and the leader of the sons of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar,"
Numbers,2,6,"and his army, even their numbered men, 54,400."
Numbers,2,7,"Then comes the tribe of Zebulun, and the leader of the sons of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon,"
Numbers,2,8,"and his army, even his numbered men, 57,400."
Numbers,2,9,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Judah: 186,400, by their armies. They shall set out first."
Numbers,2,10,"“On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur,"
Numbers,2,11,"and his army, even their numbered men, 46,500."
Numbers,2,12,"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the sons of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,"
Numbers,2,13,"and his army, even their numbered men, 59,300."
Numbers,2,14,"Then comes the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the sons of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel,"
Numbers,2,15,"and his army, even their numbered men, 45,650."
Numbers,2,16,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Reuben: 151,450 by their armies. And they shall set out second."
Numbers,2,17,"“Then the tent of meeting shall set out with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; just as they camp, so they shall set out, every man in his place by their standards."
Numbers,2,18,"“On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud,"
Numbers,2,19,"and his army, even their numbered men, 40,500."
Numbers,2,20,"Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the sons of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,"
Numbers,2,21,"and his army, even their numbered men, 32,200."
Numbers,2,22,"Then comes the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the sons of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni,"
Numbers,2,23,"and his army, even their numbered men, 35,400."
Numbers,2,24,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Ephraim: 108,100, by their armies. And they shall set out third."
Numbers,2,25,"“On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Dan: Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,"
Numbers,2,26,"and his army, even their numbered men, 62,700."
Numbers,2,27,"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the sons of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran,"
Numbers,2,28,"and his army, even their numbered men, 41,500."
Numbers,2,29,"Then comes the tribe of Naphtali, and the leader of the sons of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan,"
Numbers,2,30,"and his army, even their numbered men, 53,400."
Numbers,2,31,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Dan was 157,600. They shall set out last by their standards.”"
Numbers,2,32,"These are the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ households; the total of the numbered men of the camps by their armies, 603,550."
Numbers,2,33,"The Levites, however, were not numbered among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,2,34,"Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, every one by his family according to his father’s household."
Numbers,3,1,Now these are the records of the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"These then are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests."
Numbers,3,4,But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered strange fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron.
Numbers,3,5,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,3,6,"“Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him."
Numbers,3,7,"They shall perform the duties for him and for the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,8,"They shall also keep all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, along with the duties of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,9,You shall thus give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel.
Numbers,3,10,"So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the layman who comes near shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,3,11,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,3,12,"“Now, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn, the first issue of the womb among the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall be Mine."
Numbers,3,13,"For all the firstborn are Mine; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, from man to beast. They shall be Mine; I am the LORD.”"
Numbers,3,14,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,"
Numbers,3,15,"“Number the sons of Levi by their fathers’ households, by their families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number.”"
Numbers,3,16,"So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, just as he had been commanded."
Numbers,3,17,These then are the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon and Kohath and Merari.
Numbers,3,18,These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei;
Numbers,3,19,"and the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel;"
Numbers,3,20,and the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers’ households.
Numbers,3,21,Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these were the families of the Gershonites.
Numbers,3,22,"Their numbered men, in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, even their numbered men were 7,500."
Numbers,3,23,"The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward,"
Numbers,3,24,and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
Numbers,3,25,"Now the duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,3,26,"and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords, according to all the service concerning them."
Numbers,3,27,Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites and the family of the Hebronites and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.
Numbers,3,28,"In the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, performing the duties of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,29,"The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the southward side of the tabernacle,"
Numbers,3,30,and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
Numbers,3,31,"Now their duties involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, and the screen, and all the service concerning them;"
Numbers,3,32,"and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was the chief of the leaders of Levi, and had the oversight of those who perform the duties of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,33,Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.
Numbers,3,34,"Their numbered men in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, were 6,200."
Numbers,3,35,The leader of the fathers’ households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the northward side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,36,"Now the appointed duties of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, all its equipment, and the service concerning them,"
Numbers,3,37,and the pillars around the court with their sockets and their pegs and their cords.
Numbers,3,38,"Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, are Moses and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel; but the layman coming near was to be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of the LORD by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000."
Numbers,3,40,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names."
Numbers,3,41,"You shall take the Levites for Me, I am the LORD, instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel.”"
Numbers,3,42,"So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded him;"
Numbers,3,43,"and all the firstborn males by the number of names from a month old and upward, for their numbered men were 22,273."
Numbers,3,44,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,3,45,“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel and the cattle of the Levites. And the Levites shall be Mine; I am the LORD.
Numbers,3,46,"For the ransom of the 273 of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who are in excess beyond the Levites,"
Numbers,3,47,"you shall take five shekels apiece, per head; you shall take them in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs),"
Numbers,3,48,"and give the money, the ransom of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons.”"
Numbers,3,49,"So Moses took the ransom money from those who were in excess, beyond those ransomed by the Levites;"
Numbers,3,50,"from the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, 1,365."
Numbers,3,51,"Then Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and to his sons, at the command of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,4,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,4,2,"“Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ households,"
Numbers,4,3,"from thirty years and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,4,"This is the work of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of meeting, concerning the most holy things."
Numbers,4,5,"“When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and they shall take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it;"
Numbers,4,6,"and they shall lay a covering of porpoise skin on it, and shall spread over it a cloth of pure blue, and shall insert its poles."
Numbers,4,7,"Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a cloth of blue and put on it the dishes and the pans and the sacrificial bowls and the jars for the drink offering, and the continual bread shall be on it."
Numbers,4,8,"They shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet material, and cover the same with a covering of porpoise skin, and they shall insert its poles."
Numbers,4,9,"Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps and its snuffers, and its trays and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it;"
Numbers,4,10,"and they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put it on the carrying bars."
Numbers,4,11,"Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall insert its poles;"
Numbers,4,12,"and they shall take all the utensils of service, with which they serve in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and put them on the carrying bars."
Numbers,4,13,"Then they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it."
Numbers,4,14,"They shall also put on it all its utensils by which they serve in connection with it: the firepans, the forks and shovels and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a cover of porpoise skin over it and insert its poles."
Numbers,4,15,"When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry."
Numbers,4,16,"“The responsibility of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light and the fragrant incense and the continual grain offering and the anointing oil—the responsibility of all the tabernacle and of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.”"
Numbers,4,17,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,4,18,“Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites.
Numbers,4,19,But do this to them that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his work and to his load;
Numbers,4,20,"but they shall not go in to see the holy objects even for a moment, or they will die.”"
Numbers,4,21,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,4,22,"“Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ households, by their families;"
Numbers,4,23,"from thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them; all who enter to perform the service to do the work in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,24,"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying:"
Numbers,4,25,"they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering of porpoise skin that is on top of it, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,4,26,"and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the gate of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform."
Numbers,4,27,"All the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their loads and in all their work, shall be performed at the command of Aaron and his sons; and you shall assign to them as a duty all their loads."
Numbers,4,28,"This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,4,29,"“As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families, by their fathers’ households;"
Numbers,4,30,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,31,"Now this is the duty of their loads, for all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its sockets,"
Numbers,4,32,"and the pillars around the court and their sockets and their pegs and their cords, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign each man by name the items he is to carry."
Numbers,4,33,"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”"
Numbers,4,34,"So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers’ households,"
Numbers,4,35,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,36,"Their numbered men by their families were 2,750."
Numbers,4,37,"These are the numbered men of the Kohathite families, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses."
Numbers,4,38,"The numbered men of the sons of Gershon by their families and by their fathers’ households,"
Numbers,4,39,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,40,"Their numbered men by their families, by their fathers’ households, were 2,630."
Numbers,4,41,"These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD."
Numbers,4,42,"The numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari by their families, by their fathers’ households,"
Numbers,4,43,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,44,"Their numbered men by their families were 3,200."
Numbers,4,45,"These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses."
Numbers,4,46,"All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers’ households,"
Numbers,4,47,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,48,"Their numbered men were 8,580."
Numbers,4,49,"According to the commandment of the LORD through Moses, they were numbered, everyone by his serving or carrying; thus these were his numbered men, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,5,2,“Command the sons of Israel that they send away from the camp every leper and everyone having a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of a dead person.
Numbers,5,3,You shall send away both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp where I dwell in their midst.”
Numbers,5,4,"The sons of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as the LORD had spoken to Moses, thus the sons of Israel did."
Numbers,5,5,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,5,6,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, ‘When a man or woman commits any of the sins of mankind, acting unfaithfully against the LORD, and that person is guilty,"
Numbers,5,7,"then he shall confess his sins which he has committed, and he shall make restitution in full for his wrong and add to it one-fifth of it, and give it to him whom he has wronged."
Numbers,5,8,"But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong must go to the LORD for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which atonement is made for him."
Numbers,5,9,"Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they offer to the priest, shall be his."
Numbers,5,10,"So every man’s holy gifts shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest, it becomes his.’”"
Numbers,5,11,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,5,12,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘If any man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,"
Numbers,5,13,"and a man has intercourse with her and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act,"
Numbers,5,14,"if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has defiled herself, or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself,"
Numbers,5,15,"the man shall then bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring as an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of memorial, a reminder of iniquity."
Numbers,5,16,"‘Then the priest shall bring her near and have her stand before the LORD,"
Numbers,5,17,and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
Numbers,5,18,"The priest shall then have the woman stand before the LORD and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and place the grain offering of memorial in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,19,"The priest shall have her take an oath and shall say to the woman, “If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray into uncleanness, being under the authority of your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse;"
Numbers,5,20,"if you, however, have gone astray, being under the authority of your husband, and if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has had intercourse with you”"
Numbers,5,21,"(then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman), “the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people by the LORD’S making your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell;"
Numbers,5,22,"and this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away.” And the woman shall say, “Amen. Amen.”"
Numbers,5,23,"‘The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness."
Numbers,5,24,"Then he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness."
Numbers,5,25,"The priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar;"
Numbers,5,26,"and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water."
Numbers,5,27,"When he has made her drink the water, then it shall come about, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people."
Numbers,5,28,"But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free and conceive children."
Numbers,5,29,"‘This is the law of jealousy: when a wife, being under the authority of her husband, goes astray and defiles herself,"
Numbers,5,30,"or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then make the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall apply all this law to her."
Numbers,5,31,"Moreover, the man will be free from guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.’”"
Numbers,6,1,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,6,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate himself to the LORD,"
Numbers,6,3,"he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes."
Numbers,6,4,"All the days of his separation he shall not eat anything that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin."
Numbers,6,5,‘All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to the LORD; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long.
Numbers,6,6,‘All the days of his separation to the LORD he shall not go near to a dead person.
Numbers,6,7,"He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is on his head."
Numbers,6,8,All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
Numbers,6,9,"‘But if a man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his dedicated head of hair, then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day."
Numbers,6,10,"Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,6,11,"The priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the dead person. And that same day he shall consecrate his head,"
Numbers,6,12,"and shall dedicate to the LORD his days as a Nazirite, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering; but the former days will be void because his separation was defiled."
Numbers,6,13,"‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,6,14,"He shall present his offering to the LORD: one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering and one ewe-lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering and one ram without defect for a peace offering,"
Numbers,6,15,"and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offering."
Numbers,6,16,Then the priest shall present them before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.
Numbers,6,17,"He shall also offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,"The Nazirite shall then shave his dedicated head of hair at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and take the dedicated hair of his head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings."
Numbers,6,19,"The priest shall take the ram’s shoulder when it has been boiled, and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated hair."
Numbers,6,20,"Then the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.’"
Numbers,6,21,"“This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD according to his separation, in addition to what else he can afford; according to his vow which he takes, so he shall do according to the law of his separation.”"
Numbers,6,22,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,6,23,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them:"
Numbers,6,24,"The LORD bless you, and keep you;"
Numbers,6,25,"The LORD make His face shine on you, And be gracious to you;"
Numbers,6,26,"The LORD lift up His countenance on you, And give you peace.’"
Numbers,6,27,"So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them.”"
Numbers,7,1,"Now on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the numbered men)."
Numbers,7,3,"When they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them before the tabernacle."
Numbers,7,4,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these things from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”"
Numbers,7,6,So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Numbers,7,7,"Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service,"
Numbers,7,8,"and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,7,9,"But he did not give any to the sons of Kohath because theirs was the service of the holy objects, which they carried on the shoulder."
Numbers,7,10,"The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed, so the leaders offered their offering before the altar."
Numbers,7,11,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Let them present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.”"
Numbers,7,12,"Now the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah;"
Numbers,7,13,"and his offering was one silver dish whose weight was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;"

Numbers,7,89,"Now when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim, so He spoke to him."
Numbers,8,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,2,"“Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you mount the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in the front of the lampstand.’”"
Numbers,8,3,"Aaron therefore did so; he mounted its lamps at the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,4,"Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers it was hammered work; according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand."
Numbers,8,5,"Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,6,“Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.
Numbers,8,7,"Thus you shall do to them, for their cleansing: sprinkle purifying water on them, and let them use a razor over their whole body and wash their clothes, and they will be clean."
Numbers,8,8,"Then let them take a bull with its grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and a second bull you shall take for a sin offering."
Numbers,8,9,"So you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting. You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel,"
Numbers,8,10,and present the Levites before the LORD; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.
Numbers,8,11,"Aaron then shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may qualify to perform the service of the LORD."
Numbers,8,12,"Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,You shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and before his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to the LORD.
Numbers,8,14,"“Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine."
Numbers,8,15,Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting. But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering;
Numbers,8,16,"for they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself instead of every first issue of the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel."
Numbers,8,17,"For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, among the men and among the animals; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself."
Numbers,8,18,But I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel.
Numbers,8,19,"I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel by their coming near to the sanctuary.”"
Numbers,8,20,"Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel to the Levites; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them."
Numbers,8,21,"The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them."
Numbers,8,22,"Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons; just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them."
Numbers,8,23,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,8,24,“This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting.
Numbers,8,25,But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from service in the work and not work any more.
Numbers,8,26,"They may, however, assist their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep an obligation, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their obligations.”"
Numbers,9,1,"Thus the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
Numbers,9,2,"“Now, let the sons of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time."
Numbers,9,3,"On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall observe it at its appointed time; you shall observe it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances.”"
Numbers,9,4,So Moses told the sons of Israel to observe the Passover.
Numbers,9,5,"They observed the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did."
Numbers,9,6,"But there were some men who were unclean because of the dead person, so that they could not observe Passover on that day; so they came before Moses and Aaron on that day."
Numbers,9,7,"Those men said to him, “Though we are unclean because of the dead person, why are we restrained from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the sons of Israel?”"
Numbers,9,8,"Moses therefore said to them, “Wait, and I will listen to what the LORD will command concerning you.”"
Numbers,9,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,9,10,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If any one of you or of your generations becomes unclean because of a dead person, or is on a distant journey, he may, however, observe the Passover to the LORD."
Numbers,9,11,"In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Numbers,9,12,"They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute of the Passover they shall observe it."
Numbers,9,13,"But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and yet neglects to observe the Passover, that person shall then be cut off from his people, for he did not present the offering of the LORD at its appointed time. That man will bear his sin."
Numbers,9,14,"If an alien sojourns among you and observes the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, so he shall do; you shall have one statute, both for the alien and for the native of the land.’”"
Numbers,9,15,"Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle, until morning."
Numbers,9,16,"So it was continuously; the cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night."
Numbers,9,17,"Whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent, afterward the sons of Israel would then set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the sons of Israel would camp."
Numbers,9,18,"At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel would set out, and at the command of the LORD they would camp; as long as the cloud settled over the tabernacle, they remained camped."
Numbers,9,19,"Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel would keep the LORD’S charge and not set out."
Numbers,9,20,"If sometimes the cloud remained a few days over the tabernacle, according to the command of the LORD they remained camped. Then according to the command of the LORD they set out."
Numbers,9,21,"If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would move out; or if it remained in the daytime and at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud lingered over the tabernacle, staying above it, the sons of Israel remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they did set out."
Numbers,9,23,"At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out; they kept the LORD’S charge, according to the command of the LORD through Moses."
Numbers,10,1,"The LORD spoke further to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,10,2,"“Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out."
Numbers,10,3,"When both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"Yet if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall assemble before you."
Numbers,10,5,"But when you blow an alarm, the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out."
Numbers,10,6,"When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out; an alarm is to be blown for them to set out."
Numbers,10,7,"When convening the assembly, however, you shall blow without sounding an alarm."
Numbers,10,8,"The priestly sons of Aaron, moreover, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations."
Numbers,10,9,"When you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and be saved from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed feasts, and on the first days of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God. I am the LORD your God.”"
Numbers,10,11,"Now in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony;"
Numbers,10,12,and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,So they moved out for the first time according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
Numbers,10,14,"The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah, according to their armies, set out first, with Nahshon the son of Amminadab, over its army,"
Numbers,10,15,"and Nethanel the son of Zuar, over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar;"
Numbers,10,16,and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun.
Numbers,10,17,"Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out."
Numbers,10,18,"Next the standard of the camp of Reuben, according to their armies, set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur, over its army,"
Numbers,10,19,"and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon,"
Numbers,10,20,and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the tribal army of the sons of Gad.
Numbers,10,21,"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival."
Numbers,10,22,"Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim, according to their armies, was set out, with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army,"
Numbers,10,23,and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh;
Numbers,10,24,and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin.
Numbers,10,25,"Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, according to their armies, which formed the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army,"
Numbers,10,26,and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher;
Numbers,10,27,and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali.
Numbers,10,28,This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out.
Numbers,10,29,"Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out to the place of which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you’; come with us and we will do you good, for the LORD has promised good concerning Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"But he said to him, “I will not come, but rather will go to my own land and relatives.”"
Numbers,10,31,"Then he said, “Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will be as eyes for us."
Numbers,10,32,"So it will be, if you go with us, that whatever good the LORD does for us, we will do for you.”"
Numbers,10,33,"Thus they set out from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD journeying in front of them for the three days, to seek out a resting place for them."
Numbers,10,34,The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
Numbers,10,35,"Then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said, “Rise up, O LORD! And let Your enemies be scattered, And let those who hate You flee before You.”"
Numbers,10,36,"When it came to rest, he said, “Return, O LORD, To the myriad thousands of Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,"Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the LORD; and when the LORD heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"The people therefore cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD and the fire died out."
Numbers,11,3,"So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them."
Numbers,11,4,"The rabble who were among them had greedy desires; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic,"
Numbers,11,6,but now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna.”
Numbers,11,7,"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium."
Numbers,11,8,"The people would go about and gather it and grind it between two millstones or beat it in the mortar, and boil it in the pot and make cakes with it; and its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil."
Numbers,11,9,"When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it."
Numbers,11,10,"Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased."
Numbers,11,11,"So Moses said to the LORD, “Why have You been so hard on Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all this people on me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Was it I who conceived all this people? Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers’?"
Numbers,11,13,"Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat that we may eat!’"
Numbers,11,14,"I alone am not able to carry all this people, because it is too burdensome for me."
Numbers,11,15,"So if You are going to deal thus with me, please kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and do not let me see my wretchedness.”"
Numbers,11,16,"The LORD therefore said to Moses, “Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not bear it all alone."
Numbers,11,18,"Say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, “Oh that someone would give us meat to eat! For we were well-off in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat and you shall eat."
Numbers,11,19,"You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,"
Numbers,11,20,"but a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you; because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”"
Numbers,11,21,"But Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are 600,000 on foot; yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, so that they may eat for a whole month.’"
Numbers,11,22,"Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”"
Numbers,11,23,"The LORD said to Moses, “Is the LORD’S power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not.”"
Numbers,11,24,"So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stationed them around the tent."
Numbers,11,25,"Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it again."
Numbers,11,26,"But two men had remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"So a young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, said, “Moses, my lord, restrain them.”"
Numbers,11,29,"But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD’S people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!”"
Numbers,11,30,"Then Moses returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Israel."
Numbers,11,31,"Now there went forth a wind from the LORD and it brought quail from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp and about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground."
Numbers,11,32,"The people spent all day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers) and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very severe plague."
Numbers,11,34,"So the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had been greedy."
Numbers,11,35,"From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth."
Numbers,12,1,Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman);
Numbers,12,2,"and they said, “Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?” And the LORD heard it."
Numbers,12,3,"(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"Suddenly the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, “You three come out to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them came out."
Numbers,12,5,"Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam. When they had both come forward,"
Numbers,12,6,"He said, “Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,"“Not so, with My servant Moses, He is faithful in all My household;"
Numbers,12,8,"With him I speak mouth to mouth, Even openly, and not in dark sayings, And he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant, against Moses?”"
Numbers,12,9,So the anger of the LORD burned against them and He departed.
Numbers,12,10,"But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. As Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she was leprous."
Numbers,12,11,"Then Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not account this sin to us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned."
Numbers,12,12,"Oh, do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes from his mother’s womb!”"
Numbers,12,13,"Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “O God, heal her, I pray!”"
Numbers,12,14,"But the LORD said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be received again.”"
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was received again."
Numbers,12,16,"Afterward, however, the people moved out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses saying,"
Numbers,13,2,"“Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers’ tribes, every one a leader among them.”"
Numbers,13,3,"So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel."
Numbers,13,4,"These then were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;"
Numbers,13,5,"from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;"
Numbers,13,6,"from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;"
Numbers,13,7,"from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;"
Numbers,13,8,"from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;"
Numbers,13,9,"from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;"
Numbers,13,10,"from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;"
Numbers,13,11,"from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;"
Numbers,13,12,"from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;"
Numbers,13,13,"from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;"
Numbers,13,14,"from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;"
Numbers,13,15,"from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,"These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua."
Numbers,13,17,"When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, “Go up there into the Negev; then go up into the hill country."
Numbers,13,18,"See what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many."
Numbers,13,19,"How is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are they like open camps or with fortifications?"
Numbers,13,20,"How is the land, is it fat or lean? Are there trees in it or not? Make an effort then to get some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes."
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"When they had gone up into the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,"Then they came to the valley of Eshcol and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two men, with some of the pomegranates and the figs."
Numbers,13,24,"That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there."
Numbers,13,25,"When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days,"
Numbers,13,26,"they proceeded to come to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"Thus they told him, and said, “We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,"Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there."
Numbers,13,29,"Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we will surely overcome it.”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us.”"
Numbers,13,32,"So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size."
Numbers,13,33,"There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.”"
Numbers,14,1,"Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”"
Numbers,14,4,"So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
Numbers,14,6,"Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes;"
Numbers,14,7,"and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land."
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us—a land which flows with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"Only do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our prey. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them.”"
Numbers,14,10,But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.
Numbers,14,11,"The LORD said to Moses, “How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they.”"
Numbers,14,13,"But Moses said to the LORD, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought up this people from their midst,"
Numbers,14,14,"and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people, for You, O LORD, are seen eye to eye, while Your cloud stands over them; and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if You slay this people as one man, then the nations who have heard of Your fame will say,"
Numbers,14,16,"‘Because the LORD could not bring this people into the land which He promised them by oath, therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness.’"
Numbers,14,17,"But now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have declared,"
Numbers,14,18,"‘The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generations.’"
Numbers,14,19,"Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”"
Numbers,14,20,"So the LORD said, “I have pardoned them according to your word;"
Numbers,14,21,"but indeed, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD."
Numbers,14,22,"Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My signs which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice,"
Numbers,14,23,"shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it."
Numbers,14,24,"But My servant Caleb, because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it."
Numbers,14,25,Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”
Numbers,14,26,"The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,14,27,"“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they are making against Me."
Numbers,14,28,"Say to them, ‘As I live,’ says the LORD, ‘just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will surely do to you;"
Numbers,14,29,"your corpses will fall in this wilderness, even all your numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against Me."
Numbers,14,30,"Surely you shall not come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,14,31,"Your children, however, whom you said would become a prey—I will bring them in, and they will know the land which you have rejected."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"Your sons shall be shepherds for forty years in the wilderness, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness, until your corpses lie in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,"According to the number of days which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day you shall bear your guilt a year, even forty years, and you will know My opposition."
Numbers,14,35,"I, the LORD, have spoken, surely this I will do to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be destroyed, and there they will die.’”"
Numbers,14,36,"As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land,"
Numbers,14,37,even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague before the LORD.
Numbers,14,38,But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.
Numbers,14,39,"When Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people mourned greatly."
Numbers,14,40,"In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, “Here we are; we have indeed sinned, but we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised.”"
Numbers,14,41,"But Moses said, “Why then are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD, when it will not succeed?"
Numbers,14,42,"Do not go up, or you will be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you."
Numbers,14,43,"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword, inasmuch as you have turned back from following the LORD. And the LORD will not be with you.”"
Numbers,14,44,But they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country; neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses left the camp.
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, and struck them and beat them down as far as Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land where you are to live, which I am giving you,"
Numbers,15,3,"then make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma to the LORD, from the herd or from the flock."
Numbers,15,4,"The one who presents his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil,"
Numbers,15,5,"and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one-fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb."
Numbers,15,6,Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
Numbers,15,7,and for the drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers,15,8,"When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a special vow, or for peace offerings to the LORD,"
Numbers,15,9,then you shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-half a hin of oil;
Numbers,15,10,"and you shall offer as the drink offering one-half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,15,11,"‘Thus it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats."
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for everyone according to their number."
Numbers,15,13,"All who are native shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,15,14,"If an alien sojourns with you, or one who may be among you throughout your generations, and he wishes to make an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, just as you do so he shall do."
Numbers,15,15,"As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the alien who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the alien be before the LORD."
Numbers,15,16,There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the alien who sojourns with you.’”
Numbers,15,17,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,18,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land where I bring you,"
Numbers,15,19,"then it shall be, that when you eat of the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD."
Numbers,15,20,"Of the first of your dough you shall lift up a cake as an offering; as the offering of the threshing floor, so you shall lift it up."
Numbers,15,21,From the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an offering throughout your generations.
Numbers,15,22,"‘But when you unwittingly fail and do not observe all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,"
Numbers,15,23,"even all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day when the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations,"
Numbers,15,24,"then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one bull for a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error."
Numbers,15,26,"So all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be forgiven, with the alien who sojourns among them, for it happened to all the people through error."
Numbers,15,27,"‘Also if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall offer a one year old female goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,28,"The priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him that he may be forgiven."
Numbers,15,29,"You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the sons of Israel and for the alien who sojourns among them."
Numbers,15,30,"But the person who does anything defiantly, whether he is native or an alien, that one is blaspheming the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from among his people."
Numbers,15,31,"Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt will be on him.’”"
Numbers,15,32,"Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation;
Numbers,15,34,and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Numbers,15,35,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.”"
Numbers,15,36,"So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,15,37,"The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,15,38,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a cord of blue."
Numbers,15,39,"It shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, so as to do them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you played the harlot,"
Numbers,15,40,so that you may remember to do all My commandments and be holy to your God.
Numbers,15,41,I am the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God.”
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took action,"
Numbers,16,2,"and they rose up before Moses, together with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen in the assembly, men of renown."
Numbers,16,3,"They assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone far enough, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is in their midst; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”"
Numbers,16,4,"When Moses heard this, he fell on his face;"
Numbers,16,5,"and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who is His, and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose, He will bring near to Himself."
Numbers,16,6,"Do this: take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your company,"
Numbers,16,7,"and put fire in them, and lay incense upon them in the presence of the LORD tomorrow; and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi!”"
Numbers,16,8,"Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi,"
Numbers,16,9,"is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;"
Numbers,16,10,"and that He has brought you near, Korah, and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking for the priesthood also?"
Numbers,16,11,"Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD; but as for Aaron, who is he that you grumble against him?”"
Numbers,16,12,"Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, “We will not come up."
Numbers,16,13,"Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but you would also lord it over us?"
Numbers,16,14,"Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”"
Numbers,16,15,"Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not regard their offering! I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company be present before the LORD tomorrow, both you and they along with Aaron."
Numbers,16,17,"Each of you take his firepan and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty firepans; also you and Aaron shall each bring his firepan.”"
Numbers,16,18,"So they each took his own censer and put fire on it, and laid incense on it; and they stood at the doorway of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,16,19,Thus Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the doorway of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,16,21,"“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly.”"
Numbers,16,22,"But they fell on their faces and said, “O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the entire congregation?”"
Numbers,16,23,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,24,"“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’”"
Numbers,16,25,"Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him,"
Numbers,16,26,"and he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, or you will be swept away in all their sin.”"
Numbers,16,27,"So they got back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the doorway of their tents, along with their wives and their sons and their little ones."
Numbers,16,28,"Moses said, “By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these deeds; for this is not my doing."
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die the death of all men or if they suffer the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if the LORD brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they descend alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have spurned the LORD.”"
Numbers,16,31,"As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open;"
Numbers,16,32,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions."
Numbers,16,33,"So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly."
Numbers,16,34,"All Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, “The earth may swallow us up!”"
Numbers,16,35,Fire also came forth from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.
Numbers,16,36,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,37,"“Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he shall take up the censers out of the midst of the blaze, for they are holy; and you scatter the burning coals abroad."
Numbers,16,38,"As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered sheets for a plating of the altar, since they did present them before the LORD and they are holy; and they shall be for a sign to the sons of Israel.”"
Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who were burned had offered, and they hammered them out as a plating for the altar,"
Numbers,16,40,as a reminder to the sons of Israel that no layman who is not of the descendants of Aaron should come near to burn incense before the LORD; so that he will not become like Korah and his company—just as the LORD had spoken to him through Moses.
Numbers,16,41,"But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You are the ones who have caused the death of the LORD’S people.”"
Numbers,16,42,"It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared."
Numbers,16,43,"Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,16,44,"and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,16,45,"“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly.” Then they fell on their faces."
Numbers,16,46,"Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put in it fire from the altar, and lay incense on it; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone forth from the LORD, the plague has begun!”"
Numbers,16,47,"Then Aaron took it as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,"He took his stand between the dead and the living, so that the plague was checked."
Numbers,16,49,"But those who died by the plague were 14,700, besides those who died on account of Korah."
Numbers,16,50,"Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been checked."
Numbers,17,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,17,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father’s household: twelve rods, from all their leaders according to their fathers’ households. You shall write each name on his rod,"
Numbers,17,3,and write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers’ households.
Numbers,17,4,"You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you."
Numbers,17,5,"It will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you.”"
Numbers,17,6,"Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers’ households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods."
Numbers,17,7,So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers,17,8,"Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the LORD to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod."
Numbers,17,10,"But the LORD said to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, so that they will not die.”"
Numbers,17,11,"Thus Moses did; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did."
Numbers,17,12,"Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we perish, we are dying, we are all dying!"
Numbers,17,13,"Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?”"
Numbers,18,1,"So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,"But bring with you also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you, while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony."
Numbers,18,3,"And they shall thus attend to your obligation and the obligation of all the tent, but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, or both they and you will die."
Numbers,18,4,"They shall be joined with you and attend to the obligations of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but an outsider may not come near you."
Numbers,18,5,"So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary and the obligations of the altar, so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel."
Numbers,18,6,"Behold, I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD, to perform the service for the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,7,"But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and inside the veil, and you are to perform service. I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,18,8,"Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, “Now behold, I Myself have given you charge of My offerings, even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual allotment."
Numbers,18,9,"This shall be yours from the most holy gifts reserved from the fire; every offering of theirs, even every grain offering and every sin offering and every guilt offering, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons."
Numbers,18,10,As the most holy gifts you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
Numbers,18,11,"This also is yours, the offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual allotment. Everyone of your household who is clean may eat it."
Numbers,18,12,"All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to the LORD, I give them to you."
Numbers,18,13,"The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone of your household who is clean may eat it."
Numbers,18,14,Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
Numbers,18,15,"Every first issue of the womb of all flesh, whether man or animal, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem."
Numbers,18,16,"As to their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem them, by your valuation, five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"But the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke as an offering by fire, for a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,18,18,Their meat shall be yours; it shall be yours like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh.
Numbers,18,19,"All the offerings of the holy gifts, which the sons of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual allotment. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD to you and your descendants with you.”"
Numbers,18,20,"Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel."
Numbers,18,21,"“To the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,22,"The sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die."
Numbers,18,23,"Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
Numbers,18,24,"For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning them, ‘They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.’”"
Numbers,18,25,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,18,26,"“Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present an offering from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe."
Numbers,18,27,Your offering shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the full produce from the wine vat.
Numbers,18,28,"So you shall also present an offering to the LORD from your tithes, which you receive from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give the LORD’S offering to Aaron the priest."
Numbers,18,29,"Out of all your gifts you shall present every offering due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the sacred part from them.’"
Numbers,18,30,"You shall say to them, ‘When you have offered from it the best of it, then the rest shall be reckoned to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor, and as the product of the wine vat."
Numbers,18,31,"You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,32,"You will bear no sin by reason of it when you have offered the best of it. But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel, or you will die.’”"
Numbers,19,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
Numbers,19,2,"“This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring you an unblemished red heifer in which is no defect and on which a yoke has never been placed."
Numbers,19,3,"You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence."
Numbers,19,4,Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
Numbers,19,5,"Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned."
Numbers,19,6,The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet material and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer.
Numbers,19,7,"The priest shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward come into the camp, but the priest shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,8,"The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,9,"Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity; it is purification from sin."
Numbers,19,10,The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute to the sons of Israel and to the alien who sojourns among them.
Numbers,19,11,‘The one who touches the corpse of any person shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he will be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Anyone who touches a corpse, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."
Numbers,19,14,‘This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,15,"Every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, shall be unclean."
Numbers,19,16,"Also, anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or who has died naturally, or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,17,Then for the unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt purification from sin and flowing water shall be added to them in a vessel.
Numbers,19,18,"A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there, and on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one dying naturally or the grave."
Numbers,19,19,"Then the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean by evening."
Numbers,19,20,"‘But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself from uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,22,"Furthermore, anything that the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.’”"
Numbers,20,1,"Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. Now Miriam died there and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,"There was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,20,3,"The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, “If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!"
Numbers,20,4,"Why then have you brought the LORD’S assembly into this wilderness, for us and our beasts to die here?"
Numbers,20,5,"Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink.”"
Numbers,20,6,Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to them;
Numbers,20,7,"and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink.”"
Numbers,20,9,"So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him;"
Numbers,20,10,"and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, “Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?”"
Numbers,20,11,"Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank."
Numbers,20,12,"But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you have not believed Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"Those were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them."
Numbers,20,14,"From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom: “Thus your brother Israel has said, ‘You know all the hardship that has befallen us;"
Numbers,20,15,"that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly."
Numbers,20,16,"But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory."
Numbers,20,17,"Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king’s highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.’”"
Numbers,20,18,"Edom, however, said to him, “You shall not pass through us, or I will come out with the sword against you.”"
Numbers,20,19,"Again, the sons of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing else.”"
Numbers,20,20,"But he said, “You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out against him with a heavy force and with a strong hand."
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
Numbers,20,22,"Now when they set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying,"
Numbers,20,24,"“Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor;
Numbers,20,26,"and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered to his people, and will die there.”"
Numbers,20,27,"So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation."
Numbers,20,28,"After Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain."
Numbers,20,29,"When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days."
Numbers,21,1,"When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, then he fought against Israel and took some of them captive."
Numbers,21,2,"So Israel made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”"
Numbers,21,3,The LORD heard the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities. Thus the name of the place was called Hormah.
Numbers,21,4,"Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient because of the journey."
Numbers,21,5,"The people spoke against God and Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food.”"
Numbers,21,6,"The LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died."
Numbers,21,7,"So the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD and you; intercede with the LORD, that He may remove the serpents from us.” And Moses interceded for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, he will live.”"
Numbers,21,9,"And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard; and it came about, that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived."
Numbers,21,10,Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, to the east."
Numbers,21,12,From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered.
Numbers,21,13,"From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, “Waheb in Suphah, And the wadis of the Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,"And the slope of the wadis That extends to the site of Ar, And leans to the border of Moab.”"
Numbers,21,16,"From there they continued to Beer, that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Assemble the people, that I may give them water.”"
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Sing to it!"
Numbers,21,18,"“The well, which the leaders sank, Which the nobles of the people dug, With the scepter and with their staffs.” And from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
Numbers,21,20,"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland."
Numbers,21,21,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,"
Numbers,21,22,“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king’s highway until we have passed through your border.”
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel."
Numbers,21,24,"Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was Jazer."
Numbers,21,25,"Israel took all these cities and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her villages."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Therefore those who use proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! So let the city of Sihon be established."
Numbers,21,28,"“For a fire went forth from Heshbon, A flame from the town of Sihon; It devoured Ar of Moab, The dominant heights of the Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"“Woe to you, O Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To an Amorite king, Sihon."
Numbers,21,30,"“But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.”"
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,"Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,21,33,"Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people, for battle at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So they killed him and his sons and all his people, until there was no remnant left him; and they possessed his land."
Numbers,22,1,"Then the sons of Israel journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho."
Numbers,22,2,Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,"So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel."
Numbers,22,4,"Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they cover the surface of the land, and they are living opposite me."
Numbers,22,6,"Now, therefore, please come, curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”"
Numbers,22,7,So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam and repeated Balak’s words to him.
Numbers,22,8,"He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will bring word back to you as the LORD may speak to me.” And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent word to me,"
Numbers,22,11,"‘Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”"
Numbers,22,12,"God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”"
Numbers,22,13,"So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak’s leaders, “Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,"Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and more distinguished than the former."
Numbers,22,16,"They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Let nothing, I beg you, hinder you from coming to me;"
Numbers,22,17,"for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Please come then, curse this people for me.’”"
Numbers,22,18,"Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God."
Numbers,22,19,"Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will speak to me.”"
Numbers,22,20,"God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you shall you do.”"
Numbers,22,21,"So Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab."
Numbers,22,22,"But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, the donkey turned off from the way and went into the field; but Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way."
Numbers,22,24,"Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side."
Numbers,22,25,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself to the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall, so he struck her again."
Numbers,22,26,"The angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right hand or the left."
Numbers,22,27,"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his stick."
Numbers,22,28,"And the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Then Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a mockery of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.”"
Numbers,22,30,"The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”"
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed all the way to the ground."
Numbers,22,32,"The angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way was contrary to me."
Numbers,22,33,"But the donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, I would surely have killed you just now, and let her live.”"
Numbers,22,34,"Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back.”"
Numbers,22,35,"But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word which I tell you.” So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak."
Numbers,22,36,"When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, at the extreme end of the border."
Numbers,22,37,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor you?”"
Numbers,22,38,"So Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come now to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.”"
Numbers,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth."
Numbers,22,40,"Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders who were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from there a portion of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”"
Numbers,23,2,"Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a bare hill."
Numbers,23,4,"Now God met Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.”"
Numbers,23,5,"Then the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus.”"
Numbers,23,6,"So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab."
Numbers,23,7,"He took up his discourse and said, “From Aram Balak has brought me, Moab’s king from the mountains of the East, ‘Come curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!’"
Numbers,23,8,“How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? And how can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?
Numbers,23,9,"“As I see him from the top of the rocks, And I look at him from the hills; Behold, a people who dwells apart, And will not be reckoned among the nations."
Numbers,23,10,"“Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, And let my end be like his!”"
Numbers,23,11,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed them!”"
Numbers,23,12,"He replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, although you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,14,"So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"And he said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet the LORD over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”"
Numbers,23,17,"He came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Then he took up his discourse and said, “Arise, O Balak, and hear; Give ear to me, O son of Zippor!"
Numbers,23,19,"“God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?"
Numbers,23,20,"“Behold, I have received a command to bless; When He has blessed, then I cannot revoke it."
Numbers,23,21,"“He has not observed misfortune in Jacob; Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them."
Numbers,23,22,"“God brings them out of Egypt, He is for them like the horns of the wild ox."
Numbers,23,23,"“For there is no omen against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel; At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob And to Israel, what God has done!"
Numbers,23,24,"“Behold, a people rises like a lioness, And as a lion it lifts itself; It will not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain.”"
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!”"
Numbers,23,26,"But Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘Whatever the LORD speaks, that I must do’?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland.
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”"
Numbers,23,30,"Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,24,1,"When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens but he set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
Numbers,24,3,"He took up his discourse and said, “The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened;"
Numbers,24,4,"The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered,"
Numbers,24,5,"How fair are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel!"
Numbers,24,6,"“Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters."
Numbers,24,7,"“Water will flow from his buckets, And his seed will be by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted."
Numbers,24,8,"“God brings him out of Egypt, He is for him like the horns of the wild ox. He will devour the nations who are his adversaries, And will crush their bones in pieces, And shatter them with his arrows."
Numbers,24,9,"“He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, And cursed is everyone who curses you.”"
Numbers,24,10,"Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times!"
Numbers,24,11,"Therefore, flee to your place now. I said I would honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor.”"
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, saying,"
Numbers,24,13,"‘Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything contrary to the command of the LORD, either good or bad, of my own accord. What the LORD speaks, that I will speak’?"
Numbers,24,14,"And now, behold, I am going to my people; come, and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come.”"
Numbers,24,15,"He took up his discourse and said, “The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,"
Numbers,24,16,"The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered."
Numbers,24,17,"“I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A star shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth."
Numbers,24,18,"“Edom shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession, While Israel performs valiantly."
Numbers,24,19,"“One from Jacob shall have dominion, And will destroy the remnant from the city.”"
Numbers,24,20,"And he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, “Amalek was the first of the nations, But his end shall be destruction.”"
Numbers,24,21,"And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, “Your dwelling place is enduring, And your nest is set in the cliff."
Numbers,24,22,“Nevertheless Kain will be consumed; How long will Asshur keep you captive?”
Numbers,24,23,"Then he took up his discourse and said, “Alas, who can live except God has ordained it?"
Numbers,24,24,"“But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber; So they also will come to destruction.”"
Numbers,24,25,"Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way."
Numbers,25,1,"While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab."
Numbers,25,2,"For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods."
Numbers,25,3,"So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry against Israel."
Numbers,25,4,"The LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.”"
Numbers,25,5,"So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you slay his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor.”"
Numbers,25,6,"Then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,25,7,"When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand,"
Numbers,25,8,"and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through the body. So the plague on the sons of Israel was checked."
Numbers,25,9,"Those who died by the plague were 24,000."
Numbers,25,10,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,25,11,"“Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy."
Numbers,25,12,"Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give him My covenant of peace;"
Numbers,25,13,"and it shall be for him and his descendants after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel.’”"
Numbers,25,14,"Now the name of the slain man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father’s household among the Simeonites."
Numbers,25,15,"The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head of the people of a father’s household in Midian."
Numbers,25,16,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,25,17,“Be hostile to the Midianites and strike them;
Numbers,25,18,"for they have been hostile to you with their tricks, with which they have deceived you in the affair of Peor and in the affair of Cozbi, the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague because of Peor.”"
Numbers,26,1,"Then it came about after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,"
Numbers,26,2,"“Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ households, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel.”"
Numbers,26,3,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,"
Numbers,26,4,"“Take a census of the people from twenty years old and upward, as the LORD has commanded Moses.” Now the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt were:"
Numbers,26,5,"Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;"
Numbers,26,6,"of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites."
Numbers,26,7,"These are the families of the Reubenites, and those who were numbered of them were 43,730."
Numbers,26,8,The son of Pallu: Eliab.
Numbers,26,9,"The sons of Eliab: Nemuel and Dathan and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram who were called by the congregation, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD,"
Numbers,26,10,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up along with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured 250 men, so that they became a warning."
Numbers,26,11,"The sons of Korah, however, did not die."
Numbers,26,12,"The sons of Simeon according to their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites;"

Numbers,26,53,“Among these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
Numbers,26,54,"To the larger group you shall increase their inheritance, and to the smaller group you shall diminish their inheritance; each shall be given their inheritance according to those who were numbered of them."
Numbers,26,55,But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
Numbers,26,56,"According to the selection by lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller groups.”"
Numbers,26,57,"These are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites."
Numbers,26,58,"These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram."
Numbers,26,59,"The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam."
Numbers,26,60,"To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,26,61,But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the LORD.
Numbers,26,62,"Those who were numbered of them were 23,000, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel."
Numbers,26,63,"These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho."
Numbers,26,64,"But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai."
Numbers,26,65,"For the LORD had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.” And not a man was left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah."
Numbers,27,2,"They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, saying,"
Numbers,27,3,"“Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons."
Numbers,27,4,Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.”
Numbers,27,5,So Moses brought their case before the LORD.
Numbers,27,6,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,27,7,"“The daughters of Zelophehad are right in their statements. You shall surely give them a hereditary possession among their father’s brothers, and you shall transfer the inheritance of their father to them."
Numbers,27,8,"Further, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter."
Numbers,27,9,"If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers."
Numbers,27,10,"If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers."
Numbers,27,11,"If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be a statutory ordinance to the sons of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses.’”"
Numbers,27,12,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel."
Numbers,27,13,"When you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was;"
Numbers,27,14,"for in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to treat Me as holy before their eyes at the water.” (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)"
Numbers,27,15,"Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,"
Numbers,27,16,"“May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,"
Numbers,27,17,"who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep which have no shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18,"So the LORD said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;"
Numbers,27,19,"and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him in their sight."
Numbers,27,20,"You shall put some of your authority on him, in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him."
Numbers,27,21,"Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his command they shall go out and at his command they shall come in, both he and the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation.”"
Numbers,27,22,Moses did just as the LORD commanded him; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
Numbers,27,23,"Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses."
Numbers,28,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,28,2,"“Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be careful to present My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.’"
Numbers,28,3,"You shall say to them, ‘This is the offering by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs one year old without defect as a continual burnt offering every day."
Numbers,28,4,You shall offer the one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;
Numbers,28,5,"also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil."
Numbers,28,6,"It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD."
Numbers,28,7,"Then the drink offering with it shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD."
Numbers,28,8,"The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,28,9,"‘Then on the sabbath day two male lambs one year old without defect, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering:"
Numbers,28,10,This is the burnt offering of every sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
Numbers,28,11,"‘Then at the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect;"
Numbers,28,12,"and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for the one ram;"
Numbers,28,13,"and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for each lamb, for a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD."
Numbers,28,14,Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.
Numbers,28,15,And one male goat for a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.
Numbers,28,16,‘Then on the fourteenth day of the first month shall be the LORD’S Passover.
Numbers,28,17,"On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast, unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days."

Numbers,29,40,Moses spoke to the sons of Israel in accordance with all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers,30,1,"Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the word which the LORD has commanded."
Numbers,30,2,"If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or takes an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth."
Numbers,30,3,"“Also if a woman makes a vow to the LORD, and binds herself by an obligation in her father’s house in her youth,"
Numbers,30,4,"and her father hears her vow and her obligation by which she has bound herself, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand and every obligation by which she has bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,5,"But if her father should forbid her on the day he hears of it, none of her vows or her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her because her father had forbidden her."
Numbers,30,6,"“However, if she should marry while under her vows or the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,"
Numbers,30,7,"and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her on the day he hears it, then her vows shall stand and her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,8,"But if on the day her husband hears of it, he forbids her, then he shall annul her vow which she is under and the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her."
Numbers,30,9,"“But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her."
Numbers,30,10,"However, if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound herself by an obligation with an oath,"
Numbers,30,11,"and her husband heard it, but said nothing to her and did not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand and every obligation by which she bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband indeed annuls them on the day he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the obligation of herself shall not stand; her husband has annulled them, and the LORD will forgive her."
Numbers,30,13,"“Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may confirm it or her husband may annul it."
Numbers,30,14,"But if her husband indeed says nothing to her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her obligations which are on her; he has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them."
Numbers,30,15,"But if he indeed annuls them after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt.”"
Numbers,30,16,"These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, as between a man and his wife, and as between a father and his daughter, while she is in her youth in her father’s house."
Numbers,31,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,31,2,“Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people.”
Numbers,31,3,"Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD’S vengeance on Midian."
Numbers,31,4,A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.”
Numbers,31,5,"So there were furnished from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war."
Numbers,31,6,"Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war with them, and the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand."
Numbers,31,7,"So they made war against Midian, just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male."
Numbers,31,8,"They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,The sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they plundered.
Numbers,31,10,Then they burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps with fire.
Numbers,31,11,"They took all the spoil and all the prey, both of man and of beast."
Numbers,31,12,"They brought the captives and the prey and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.
Numbers,31,14,"Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who had come from service in the war."
Numbers,31,15,"And Moses said to them, “Have you spared all the women?"
Numbers,31,16,"Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, so the plague was among the congregation of the LORD."
Numbers,31,17,"Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately."
Numbers,31,18,"But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves."
Numbers,31,19,"And you, camp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves, you and your captives, on the third day and on the seventh day."
Numbers,31,20,"You shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of leather and all the work of goats’ hair, and all articles of wood.”"
Numbers,31,21,"Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle, “This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses:"
Numbers,31,22,"only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin and the lead,"
Numbers,31,23,"everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean, but it shall be purified with water for impurity. But whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water."
Numbers,31,24,"And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may enter the camp.”"
Numbers,31,25,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,31,26,"“You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal;"
Numbers,31,27,and divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
Numbers,31,28,"Levy a tax for the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep;"
Numbers,31,29,"take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to the LORD."
Numbers,31,30,"From the sons of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.”"
Numbers,31,31,Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"Now the booty that remained from the spoil which the men of war had plundered was 675,000 sheep,"
Numbers,31,33,"and 72,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,34,"and 61,000 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,35,"and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were 32,000."
Numbers,31,36,"The half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was 337,500,"
Numbers,31,37,and the LORD’S levy of the sheep was 675;
Numbers,31,38,"and the cattle were 36,000, from which the LORD’S levy was 72;"
Numbers,31,39,"and the donkeys were 30,500, from which the LORD’S levy was 61;"
Numbers,31,40,"and the human beings were 16,000, from whom the LORD’S levy was 32 persons."
Numbers,31,41,"Moses gave the levy which was the LORD’S offering to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"As for the sons of Israel’s half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war—"
Numbers,31,43,"now the congregation’s half was 337,500 sheep,"
Numbers,31,44,"and 36,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"and 30,500 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,46,"and the human beings were 16,000—"
Numbers,31,47,"and from the sons of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,48,"Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses,"
Numbers,31,49,"and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing."
Numbers,31,50,"So we have brought as an offering to the LORD what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”"
Numbers,31,51,"Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles."
Numbers,31,52,"All the gold of the offering which they offered up to the LORD, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels."
Numbers,31,53,"The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself."
Numbers,31,54,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD."
Numbers,32,1,"Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock. So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock,"
Numbers,32,2,"the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,"
Numbers,32,3,"“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon,"
Numbers,32,4,"the land which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”"
Numbers,32,5,"They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,6,"But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here?"
Numbers,32,7,Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which the LORD has given them?
Numbers,32,8,This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers,32,9,"For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land which the LORD had given them."
Numbers,32,10,"So the LORD’S anger burned in that day, and He swore, saying,"
Numbers,32,11,"‘None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob; for they did not follow Me fully,"
Numbers,32,12,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have followed the LORD fully.’"
Numbers,32,13,"So the LORD’S anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the LORD was destroyed."
Numbers,32,14,"Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of the LORD against Israel."
Numbers,32,15,"For if you turn away from following Him, He will once more abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.”"
Numbers,32,16,"Then they came near to him and said, “We will build here sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our little ones;"
Numbers,32,17,"but we ourselves will be armed ready to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,"For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan toward the east.”"
Numbers,32,20,"So Moses said to them, “If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for the war,"
Numbers,32,21,"and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies out from before Him,"
Numbers,32,22,"and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward the LORD and toward Israel, and this land shall be yours for a possession before the LORD."
Numbers,32,23,"But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out."
Numbers,32,24,"Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and sheepfolds for your sheep, and do what you have promised.”"
Numbers,32,25,"The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands."
Numbers,32,26,"Our little ones, our wives, our livestock and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead;"
Numbers,32,27,"while your servants, everyone who is armed for war, will cross over in the presence of the LORD to battle, just as my lord says.”"
Numbers,32,28,"So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the sons of Israel."
Numbers,32,29,"Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;"
Numbers,32,30,"but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”"
Numbers,32,31,"The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, “As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do."
Numbers,32,32,"We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us across the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,33,"So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with their territories, the cities of the surrounding land."
Numbers,32,34,"The sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,"
Numbers,32,35,"and Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,"
Numbers,32,36,"and Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and sheepfolds for sheep."
Numbers,32,37,"The sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim,"
Numbers,32,38,"and Nebo and Baal-meon—their names being changed—and Sibmah, and they gave other names to the cities which they built."
Numbers,32,39,"The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it."
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it."
Numbers,32,41,"Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth-jair."
Numbers,32,42,"Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name."
Numbers,33,1,"These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, by which they came out from the land of Egypt by their armies, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,33,2,"Moses recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the LORD, and these are their journeys according to their starting places."
Numbers,33,3,"They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the sons of Israel started out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians,"
Numbers,33,4,while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom the LORD had struck down among them. The LORD had also executed judgments on their gods.
Numbers,33,5,Then the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses and camped in Succoth.
Numbers,33,6,"They journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness."
Numbers,33,7,"They journeyed from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,They journeyed from before Hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
Numbers,33,9,"They journeyed from Marah and came to Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there."
Numbers,33,10,They journeyed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers,33,11,They journeyed from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,They journeyed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
Numbers,33,13,They journeyed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
Numbers,33,14,They journeyed from Alush and camped at Rephidim; now it was there that the people had no water to drink.
Numbers,33,15,They journeyed from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,33,16,They journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
Numbers,33,17,They journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,They journeyed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
Numbers,33,19,They journeyed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
Numbers,33,20,They journeyed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
Numbers,33,21,They journeyed from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
Numbers,33,22,They journeyed from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah.
Numbers,33,23,They journeyed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
Numbers,33,24,They journeyed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
Numbers,33,25,They journeyed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,They journeyed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,They journeyed from Tahath and camped at Terah.
Numbers,33,28,They journeyed from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
Numbers,33,29,They journeyed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
Numbers,33,30,They journeyed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
Numbers,33,31,They journeyed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
Numbers,33,32,They journeyed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
Numbers,33,33,They journeyed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers,33,34,They journeyed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers,33,35,They journeyed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
Numbers,33,36,"They journeyed from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh."
Numbers,33,37,"They journeyed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom."
Numbers,33,38,"Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come from the land of Egypt, on the first day in the fifth month."
Numbers,33,39,Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,"Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the sons of Israel."
Numbers,33,41,Then they journeyed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,They journeyed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers,33,43,They journeyed from Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,33,44,"They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, at the border of Moab."
Numbers,33,45,They journeyed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
Numbers,33,46,They journeyed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
Numbers,33,47,"They journeyed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo."
Numbers,33,48,They journeyed from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Numbers,33,49,"They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab."
Numbers,33,50,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,"
Numbers,33,51,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,33,52,"then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places;"
Numbers,33,53,"and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it."
Numbers,33,54,"You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give more inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers."
Numbers,33,55,"But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come about that those whom you let remain of them will become as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land in which you live."
Numbers,33,56,"And as I plan to do to them, so I will do to you.’”"
Numbers,34,1,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,34,2,"“Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders."
Numbers,34,3,"Your southern sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern border shall extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward."
Numbers,34,4,"Then your border shall turn direction from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin, and its termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall reach Hazaraddar and continue to Azmon."
Numbers,34,5,"The border shall turn direction from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its termination shall be at the sea."
Numbers,34,6,"‘As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea, that is, its coastline; this shall be your west border."
Numbers,34,7,‘And this shall be your north border: you shall draw your border line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor.
Numbers,34,8,"You shall draw a line from Mount Hor to the Lebo-hamath, and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad;"
Numbers,34,9,"and the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border."
Numbers,34,10,"‘For your eastern border you shall also draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham,"
Numbers,34,11,and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth.
Numbers,34,12,And the border shall go down to the Jordan and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.’”
Numbers,34,13,"So Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the land that you are to apportion by lot among you as a possession, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received theirs according to their fathers’ households, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers’ households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession."
Numbers,34,15,"The two and a half tribes have received their possession across the Jordan opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrising.”"
Numbers,34,16,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,34,17,“These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers,34,18,You shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance.
Numbers,34,19,"These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh."
Numbers,34,20,"Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud."
Numbers,34,21,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon."
Numbers,34,22,"Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli."
Numbers,34,23,"Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod."
Numbers,34,24,"Of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan."
Numbers,34,25,"Of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach."
Numbers,34,26,"Of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan."
Numbers,34,27,"Of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi."
Numbers,34,28,"Of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”"
Numbers,34,29,These are those whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,"
Numbers,35,2,“Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to live in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities.
Numbers,35,3,The cities shall be theirs to live in; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their beasts.
Numbers,35,4,“The pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits around.
Numbers,35,5,"You shall also measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the center. This shall become theirs as pasture lands for the cities."
Numbers,35,6,"The cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities."
Numbers,35,7,"All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, together with their pasture lands."
Numbers,35,8,"As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, you shall take more from the larger and you shall take less from the smaller; each shall give some of his cities to the Levites in proportion to his possession which he inherits.”"
Numbers,35,9,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,35,11,"then you shall select for yourselves cities to be your cities of refuge, that the manslayer who has killed any person unintentionally may flee there."
Numbers,35,12,"The cities shall be to you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands before the congregation for trial."
Numbers,35,13,The cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,14,You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they are to be cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,15,"These six cities shall be for refuge for the sons of Israel, and for the alien and for the sojourner among them; that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there."
Numbers,35,16,"‘But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"If he struck him down with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand, by which he might die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,The blood avenger himself shall put the murderer to death; he shall put him to death when he meets him.
Numbers,35,20,"If he pushed him of hatred, or threw something at him lying in wait and as a result he died,"
Numbers,35,21,"or if he struck him down with his hand in enmity, and as a result he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death, he is a murderer; the blood avenger shall put the murderer to death when he meets him."
Numbers,35,22,"‘But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw something at him without lying in wait,"
Numbers,35,23,"or with any deadly object of stone, and without seeing it dropped on him so that he died, while he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury,"
Numbers,35,24,then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these ordinances.
Numbers,35,25,"The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,"But if the manslayer at any time goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he may flee,"
Numbers,35,27,"and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the blood avenger kills the manslayer, he will not be guilty of blood"
Numbers,35,28,because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,‘These things shall be for a statutory ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers,35,30,"‘If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death at the evidence of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness."
Numbers,35,31,"Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,32,"You shall not take ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest."
Numbers,35,33,"So you shall not pollute the land in which you are; for blood pollutes the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel.’”"
Numbers,36,1,"And the heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers’ households of the sons of Israel,"
Numbers,36,2,"and they said, “The LORD commanded my lord to give the land by lot to the sons of Israel as an inheritance, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"But if they marry one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; thus it will be withdrawn from our allotted inheritance."
Numbers,36,4,"When the jubilee of the sons of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”"
Numbers,36,5,"Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph are right in their statements."
Numbers,36,6,"This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry whom they wish; only they must marry within the family of the tribe of their father.’"
Numbers,36,7,"Thus no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall each hold to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers."
Numbers,36,8,"Every daughter who comes into possession of an inheritance of any tribe of the sons of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,"Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall each hold to his own inheritance.”"
Numbers,36,10,"Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did:"
Numbers,36,11,"Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad married their uncles’ sons."
Numbers,36,12,"They married those from the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father."
Numbers,36,13,These are the commandments and the ordinances which the LORD commanded to the sons of Israel through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had commanded him to give to them,"
Deuteronomy,1,4,"after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"“The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Turn and set your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negev and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have placed the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to them and their descendants after them.’"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"“I spoke to you at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to bear the burden of you alone."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day like the stars of heaven in number."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand-fold more than you are and bless you, just as He has promised you!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife?
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.’"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"You answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have said to do is good.’"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them heads over you, leaders of thousands and of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and officers for your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"“Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman, or the alien who is with him."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’"
Deuteronomy,1,18,I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"“Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the LORD our God is about to give us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear or be dismayed.’"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"“Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up and the cities which we shall enter.’"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol and spied it out."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"Then they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought us back a report and said, ‘It is a good land which the LORD our God is about to give us.’"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"“Yet you were not willing to go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;"
Deuteronomy,1,27,"and you grumbled in your tents and said, ‘Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified to heaven. And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there.”’"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said to you, ‘Do not be shocked, nor fear them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God who goes before you will Himself fight on your behalf, just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place.’"
Deuteronomy,1,32,"But for all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"who goes before you on your way, to seek out a place for you to encamp, in fire by night and cloud by day, to show you the way in which you should go."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"“Then the LORD heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and took an oath, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"‘Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has set foot, because he has followed the LORD fully.’"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"The LORD was angry with me also on your account, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there; encourage him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"“Then you said to me, ‘We have sinned against the LORD; we will indeed go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.’ And every man of you girded on his weapons of war, and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"And the LORD said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; otherwise you will be defeated before your enemies.”’"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,"The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah."
Deuteronomy,1,45,Then you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.
Deuteronomy,1,46,"So you remained in Kadesh many days, the days that you spent there."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"“Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and circled Mount Seir for many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"And the LORD spoke to me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,"‘You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn north,"
Deuteronomy,2,4,"and command the people, saying, “You will pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful;"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, even as little as a footstep because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You shall buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,For the LORD your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has known your wanderings through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing.”’
Deuteronomy,2,8,"“So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘Do not harass Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.’"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emim lived there formerly, a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"Like the Anakim, they are also regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,‘Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves.’ So we crossed over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy,2,14,"Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"“So it came about when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"that the LORD spoke to me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"‘Today you shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harass them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.’"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"(It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim formerly lived in it, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin,"
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed them before them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place,"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"‘Arise, set out, and pass through the valley of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"“So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"‘Let me pass through your land, I will travel only on the highway; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot,"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God is giving to us.’"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to deliver him into your hand, as he is today."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"The LORD said to me, ‘See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to occupy, that you may possess his land.’"
Deuteronomy,2,32,“Then Sihon with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,"The LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him with his sons and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"So we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city. We left no survivor."
Deuteronomy,2,35,We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and from the city which is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us; the LORD our God delivered all over to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only you did not go near to the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had commanded us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"“Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"But the LORD said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the LORD our God delivered Og also, king of Bashan, with all his people into our hand, and we smote them until no survivor was left."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women and children of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the animals and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"“Thus we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir):"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"(For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. Its length was nine cubits and its width four cubits by ordinary cubit.)"
Deuteronomy,3,12,"“So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it, that is, Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,To Machir I gave Gilead.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even as far as the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border and as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"the Arabah also, with the Jordan as a border, from Chinnereth even as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"“Then I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; all you valiant men shall cross over armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you,"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the LORD gives rest to your fellow countrymen as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God will give them beyond the Jordan. Then you may return every man to his possession which I have given you.’"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Do not fear them, for the LORD your God is the one fighting for you.’"
Deuteronomy,3,23,"“I also pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"‘O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as Yours?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Let me, I pray, cross over and see the fair land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me; and the LORD said to me, ‘Enough! Speak to Me no more of this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he will give them as an inheritance the land which you will see.’"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"“Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the LORD has done in the case of Baal-peor, for all the men who followed Baal-peor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you."
Deuteronomy,4,4,"But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you."
Deuteronomy,4,5,"“See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’"
Deuteronomy,4,7,For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I am setting before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"“Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, ‘Assemble the people to Me, that I may let them hear My words so they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.’"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the very heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud and thick gloom."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form—only a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone."
Deuteronomy,4,14,"The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might perform them in the land where you are going over to possess it."
Deuteronomy,4,15,"“So watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"so that you do not act corruptly and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as today."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"“Now the LORD was angry with me on your account, and swore that I would not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,4,22,"For I will die in this land, I shall not cross the Jordan, but you shall cross and take possession of this good land."
Deuteronomy,4,23,"So watch yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything against which the LORD your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"“When you become the father of children and children’s children and have remained long in the land, and act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD your God so as to provoke Him to anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it. You shall not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will serve gods, the work of man’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice."
Deuteronomy,4,31,For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.
Deuteronomy,4,32,"“Indeed, ask now concerning the former days which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and inquire from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything been done like this great thing, or has anything been heard like it?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard it, and survived?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,"To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him."
Deuteronomy,4,36,"Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them. And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power,"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,4,39,"Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time.”"
Deuteronomy,4,41,"Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,42,"that a manslayer might flee there, who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel;
Deuteronomy,4,45,"these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out from Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan to the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),"
Deuteronomy,4,49,"with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I am speaking today in your hearing, that you may learn them and observe them carefully."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, with all those of us alive here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,"The LORD spoke to you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,5,5,"while I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain. He said,"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"‘I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy,5,7,‘You shall have no other gods before Me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,"‘You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth."
Deuteronomy,5,9,"You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,"but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments."
Deuteronomy,5,11,"‘You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"‘Observe the sabbath day to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you."
Deuteronomy,5,15,"You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day."
Deuteronomy,5,16,"‘Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you on the land which the LORD your God gives you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,‘You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,‘You shall not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,‘You shall not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,‘You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, and you shall not desire your neighbor’s house, his field or his male servant or his female servant, his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’"
Deuteronomy,5,22,"“These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud and of the thick gloom, with a great voice, and He added no more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"And when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders."
Deuteronomy,5,24,"You said, ‘Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"Now then why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, then we will die."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,"Go near and hear all that the LORD our God says; then speak to us all that the LORD our God speaks to you, and we will hear and do it.’"
Deuteronomy,5,28,"“The LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, ‘I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken."
Deuteronomy,5,29,"Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear Me and keep all My commandments always, that it may be well with them and with their sons forever!"
Deuteronomy,5,30,"Go, say to them, “Return to your tents.”"
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But as for you, stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe them in the land which I give them to possess.’"
Deuteronomy,5,32,So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy,5,33,"You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you will possess."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"“Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it,"
Deuteronomy,6,2,"so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"“Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!"
Deuteronomy,6,5,You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
Deuteronomy,6,6,"These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart."
Deuteronomy,6,7,You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy,6,8,You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
Deuteronomy,6,9,You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"“Then it shall come about when the LORD your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you, great and splendid cities which you did not build,"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat and are satisfied,"
Deuteronomy,6,12,"then watch yourself, that you do not forget the LORD who brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy,6,13,You shall fear only the LORD your God; and you shall worship Him and swear by His name.
Deuteronomy,6,14,"You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround you,"
Deuteronomy,6,15,"for the LORD your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth."
Deuteronomy,6,16,"“You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah."
Deuteronomy,6,17,"You should diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,6,18,"You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to give your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,6,19,"by driving out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken."
Deuteronomy,6,20,"“When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What do the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments mean which the LORD our God commanded you?’"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"then you shall say to your son, ‘We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the LORD brought us from Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,6,22,"Moreover, the LORD showed great and distressing signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt, Pharaoh and all his household;"
Deuteronomy,6,23,"He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land which He had sworn to our fathers.’"
Deuteronomy,6,24,"So the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God for our good always and for our survival, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,6,25,"It will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all this commandment before the LORD our God, just as He commanded us."
Deuteronomy,7,1,"“When the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and stronger than you,"
Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when the LORD your God delivers them before you and you defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them."
Deuteronomy,7,3,"Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons."
Deuteronomy,7,4,For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods; then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you and He will quickly destroy you.
Deuteronomy,7,5,"But thus you shall do to them: you shall tear down their altars, and smash their sacred pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire."
Deuteronomy,7,6,For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy,7,7,"“The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples,"
Deuteronomy,7,8,"but because the LORD loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the LORD brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;"
Deuteronomy,7,10,"but repays those who hate Him to their faces, to destroy them; He will not delay with him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face."
Deuteronomy,7,11,"Therefore, you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them."
Deuteronomy,7,12,"“Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them, that the LORD your God will keep with you His covenant and His lovingkindness which He swore to your forefathers."
Deuteronomy,7,13,"He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,You shall be blessed above all peoples; there will be no male or female barren among you or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy,7,15,"The LORD will remove from you all sickness; and He will not put on you any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known, but He will lay them on all who hate you."
Deuteronomy,7,16,"You shall consume all the peoples whom the LORD your God will deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"“If you should say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?’"
Deuteronomy,7,18,you shall not be afraid of them; you shall well remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:
Deuteronomy,7,19,the great trials which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
Deuteronomy,7,20,"Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet against them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish."
Deuteronomy,7,21,"You shall not dread them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God."
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly, for the wild beasts would grow too numerous for you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,"But the LORD your God will deliver them before you, and will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed."
Deuteronomy,7,24,He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you will make their name perish from under heaven; no man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy,7,25,"The graven images of their gods you are to burn with fire; you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, or you will be snared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and like it come under the ban; you shall utterly detest it and you shall utterly abhor it, for it is something banned."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"“All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your forefathers."
Deuteronomy,8,2,"You shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not."
Deuteronomy,8,3,"He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,8,4,"Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years."
Deuteronomy,8,5,Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.
Deuteronomy,8,6,"Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him."
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;"
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;"
Deuteronomy,8,9,"a land where you will eat food without scarcity, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper."
Deuteronomy,8,10,"When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you."
Deuteronomy,8,11,“Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today;
Deuteronomy,8,12,"otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and lived in them,"
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have multiplies,"
Deuteronomy,8,14,"then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy,8,15,"He led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water; He brought water for you out of the rock of flint."
Deuteronomy,8,16,"In the wilderness He fed you manna which your fathers did not know, that He might humble you and that He might test you, to do good for you in the end."
Deuteronomy,8,17,"Otherwise, you may say in your heart, ‘My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.’"
Deuteronomy,8,18,"But you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day."
Deuteronomy,8,19,"It shall come about if you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish."
Deuteronomy,8,20,"Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you would not listen to the voice of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,9,1,"“Hear, O Israel! You are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified to heaven,"
Deuteronomy,9,2,"a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’"
Deuteronomy,9,3,"Know therefore today that it is the LORD your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as the LORD has spoken to you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"“Do not say in your heart when the LORD your God has driven them out before you, ‘Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,’ but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is dispossessing them before you."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"“Know, then, it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,"Remember, do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD."
Deuteronomy,9,8,"Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that He would have destroyed you."
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the LORD had made with you, then I remained on the mountain forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,The LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God; and on them were all the words which the LORD had spoken with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy,9,11,"It came about at the end of forty days and nights that the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves.’"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"The LORD spoke further to me, saying, ‘I have seen this people, and indeed, it is a stubborn people."
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’"
Deuteronomy,9,15,"“So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God. You had made for yourselves a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
Deuteronomy,9,17,I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy,9,18,"I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger."
Deuteronomy,9,19,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wrathful against you in order to destroy you, but the LORD listened to me that time also."
Deuteronomy,9,20,The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time.
Deuteronomy,9,21,"I took your sinful thing, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that came down from the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,22,“Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath.
Deuteronomy,9,23,"When the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, ‘Go up and possess the land which I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day I knew you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,"“So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and nights, which I did because the LORD had said He would destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed to the LORD and said, ‘O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"Otherwise the land from which You brought us may say, “Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which He had promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.”"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"Yet they are Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and Your outstretched arm.’"
Deuteronomy,10,1,"“At that time the LORD said to me, ‘Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood for yourself."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered, and you shall put them in the ark.’"
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand."
Deuteronomy,10,4,"He wrote on the tablets, like the former writing, the Ten Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,10,5,"Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me.”"
Deuteronomy,10,6,(Now the sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place.
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, just as the LORD your God spoke to him.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,"“I, moreover, stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time, and the LORD listened to me that time also; the LORD was not willing to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘Arise, proceed on your journey ahead of the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.’"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"“Now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,10,13,and to keep the LORD’S commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?
Deuteronomy,10,14,"Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"Yet on your fathers did the LORD set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day."
Deuteronomy,10,16,"So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer."
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,"You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and you shall swear by His name."
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"“You shall therefore love the LORD your God, and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Know this day that I am not speaking with your sons who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the LORD your God—His greatness, His mighty hand and His outstretched arm,"
Deuteronomy,11,3,and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land;
Deuteronomy,11,4,"and what He did to Egypt’s army, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea to engulf them while they were pursuing you, and the LORD completely destroyed them;"
Deuteronomy,11,5,and what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, among all Israel—"
Deuteronomy,11,7,but your own eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"“You shall therefore keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land into which you are about to cross to possess it;"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"so that you may prolong your days on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land, into which you are entering to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you used to sow your seed and water it with your foot like a vegetable garden."
Deuteronomy,11,11,"But the land into which you are about to cross to possess it, a land of hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven,"
Deuteronomy,11,12,"a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning even to the end of the year."
Deuteronomy,11,13,"“It shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,11,14,"that He will give the rain for your land in its season, the early and late rain, that you may gather in your grain and your new wine and your oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,"He will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied."
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Beware that your hearts are not deceived, and that you do not turn away and serve other gods and worship them."
Deuteronomy,11,17,"Or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its fruit; and you will perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"“You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul; and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead."
Deuteronomy,11,19,"You shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up."
Deuteronomy,11,20,"You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"so that your days and the days of your sons may be multiplied on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens remain above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"For if you are careful to keep all this commandment which I am commanding you to do, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and hold fast to Him,"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours; your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No man will be able to stand before you; the LORD your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land on which you set foot, as He has spoken to you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"“See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:"
Deuteronomy,11,27,"the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today;"
Deuteronomy,11,28,"and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following other gods which you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"“It shall come about, when the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, that you shall place the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"Are they not across the Jordan, west of the way toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?"
Deuteronomy,11,31,"For you are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and live in it,"
Deuteronomy,11,32,and you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy,12,1,"“These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall carefully observe in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth."
Deuteronomy,12,2,"You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree."
Deuteronomy,12,3,"You shall tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and burn their Asherim with fire, and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place."
Deuteronomy,12,4,You shall not act like this toward the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,12,5,"But you shall seek the LORD at the place which the LORD your God will choose from all your tribes, to establish His name there for His dwelling, and there you shall come."
Deuteronomy,12,6,"There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution of your hand, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"There also you and your households shall eat before the LORD your God, and rejoice in all your undertakings in which the LORD your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,"“You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes;"
Deuteronomy,12,9,for you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security,"
Deuteronomy,12,11,"then it shall come about that the place in which the LORD your God will choose for His name to dwell, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution of your hand, and all your choice votive offerings which you will vow to the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance with you."
Deuteronomy,12,13,"“Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every cultic place you see,"
Deuteronomy,12,14,"but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you."
Deuteronomy,12,15,"“However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, whatever you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer."
Deuteronomy,12,16,Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"You are not allowed to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, or the firstborn of your herd or flock, or any of your votive offerings which you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the contribution of your hand."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"But you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and daughter, and your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all your undertakings."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Be careful that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"“When the LORD your God extends your border as He has promised you, and you say, ‘I will eat meat,’ because you desire to eat meat, then you may eat meat, whatever you desire."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place which the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you may slaughter of your herd and flock which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates whatever you desire."
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Just as a gazelle or a deer is eaten, so you will eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it."
Deuteronomy,12,23,"Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh."
Deuteronomy,12,24,You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,"You shall not eat it, so that it may be well with you and your sons after you, for you will be doing what is right in the sight of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,26,"Only your holy things which you may have and your votive offerings, you shall take and go to the place which the LORD chooses."
Deuteronomy,12,27,"And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh."
Deuteronomy,12,28,"“Be careful to listen to all these words which I command you, so that it may be well with you and your sons after you forever, for you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,12,29,"“When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,"
Deuteronomy,12,30,"beware that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, ‘How do these nations serve their gods, that I also may do likewise?’"
Deuteronomy,12,31,"You shall not behave thus toward the LORD your God, for every abominable act which the LORD hates they have done for their gods; for they even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods."
Deuteronomy,12,32,"“Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it."
Deuteronomy,13,1,"“If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder,"
Deuteronomy,13,2,"and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,’"
Deuteronomy,13,3,you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy,13,4,"You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him."
Deuteronomy,13,5,"But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you."
Deuteronomy,13,6,"“If your brother, your mother’s son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (whom neither you nor your fathers have known,"
Deuteronomy,13,7,"of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end),"
Deuteronomy,13,8,"you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him."
Deuteronomy,13,9,"But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people."
Deuteronomy,13,10,"So you shall stone him to death because he has sought to seduce you from the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy,13,11,"Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you."
Deuteronomy,13,12,"“If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to live in, anyone saying that"
Deuteronomy,13,13,"some worthless men have gone out from among you and have seduced the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (whom you have not known),"
Deuteronomy,13,14,"then you shall investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the matter established that this abomination has been done among you,"
Deuteronomy,13,15,"you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword."
Deuteronomy,13,16,Then you shall gather all its booty into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its booty with fire as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God; and it shall be a ruin forever. It shall never be rebuilt.
Deuteronomy,13,17,"Nothing from that which is put under the ban shall cling to your hand, in order that the LORD may turn from His burning anger and show mercy to you, and have compassion on you and make you increase, just as He has sworn to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,13,18,"if you will listen to the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments which I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,14,1,“You are the sons of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead.

Deuteronomy,14,3,“You shall not eat any detestable thing.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,"

Deuteronomy,14,6,"Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat."
Deuteronomy,14,7,"Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these among those which chew the cud, or among those that divide the hoof in two: the camel and the rabbit and the shaphan, for though they chew the cud, they do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"The pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, it is unclean for you. You shall not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses."
Deuteronomy,14,9,"“These you may eat of all that are in water: anything that has fins and scales you may eat,"
Deuteronomy,14,10,but anything that does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.

Deuteronomy,14,19,And all the teeming life with wings are unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy,14,20,You may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy,14,21,"“You shall not eat anything which dies of itself. You may give it to the alien who is in your town, so that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,"“You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year."
Deuteronomy,14,23,"You shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always."
Deuteronomy,14,24,"If the distance is so great for you that you are not able to bring the tithe, since the place where the LORD your God chooses to set His name is too far away from you when the LORD your God blesses you,"
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then you shall exchange it for money, and bind the money in your hand and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses."
Deuteronomy,14,26,"You may spend the money for whatever your heart desires: for oxen, or sheep, or wine, or strong drink, or whatever your heart desires; and there you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice, you and your household."

Deuteronomy,15,1,“At the end of every seven years you shall grant a remission of debts.
Deuteronomy,15,2,"This is the manner of remission: every creditor shall release what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother, because the LORD’S remission has been proclaimed."
Deuteronomy,15,3,"From a foreigner you may exact it, but your hand shall release whatever of yours is with your brother."
Deuteronomy,15,4,"However, there will be no poor among you, since the LORD will surely bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess,"
Deuteronomy,15,5,"if only you listen obediently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today."
