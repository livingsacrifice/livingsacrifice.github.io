Daniel,9,12,"And he hath confirmed{H6965}{(H8686)} his words{H1697}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} against us, and against our judges{H8199}{(H8802)} that judged{H8199}{(H8804)} us, by bringing{H935}{(H8687)} upon us a great{H1419} evil{H7451}: for under the whole heaven{H8064} hath not been done{H6213}{(H8738)} as hath been done{H6213}{(H8738)} upon Jerusalem{H3389}."
Daniel,9,13,"As it is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872}, all this evil{H7451} is come{H935}{(H8804)} upon us: yet made we not our prayer{H2470}{(H8765)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, that we might turn{H7725}{(H8800)} from our iniquities{H5771}, and understand{H7919}{(H8687)} thy truth{H571}."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore hath the LORD{H3068} watched{H8245}{(H8799)} upon the evil{H7451}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} it upon us: for the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} is righteous{H6662} in all his works{H4639} which he doeth{H6213}{(H8804)}: for we obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not his voice{H6963}."
Daniel,9,15,"And now, O Lord{H136} our God{H430}, that hast brought{H3318} thy people{H5971} forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} with a mighty{H2389} hand{H3027}, and hast gotten{H6213}{(H8799)} thee renown{H8034}, as at this day{H3117}; we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, we have done wickedly{H7561}{(H8804)}."
Daniel,9,16,"O Lord{H136}, according to all thy righteousness{H6666}, I beseech thee, let thine anger{H639} and thy fury{H2534} be turned away{H7725}{(H8799)} from thy city{H5892} Jerusalem{H3389}, thy holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}: because for our sins{H2399}, and for the iniquities{H5771} of our fathers{H1}, Jerusalem{H3389} and thy people{H5971} are become a reproach{H2781} to all that are about{H5439} us."
Daniel,9,17,"Now therefore, O our God{H430}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the prayer{H8605} of thy servant{H5650}, and his supplications{H8469}, and cause thy face{H6440} to shine{H215}{(H8685)} upon thy sanctuary{H4720} that is desolate{H8076}, for the Lord's{H136} sake."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God{H430}, incline{H5186}{(H8685)} thine ear{H241}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)}; open{H6491}{(H8798)} thine eyes{H5869}, and behold{H7200}{(H8798)} our desolations{H8074}{(H8802)}, and the city{H5892} which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by thy name{H8034}: for we do not present{H5307}{(H8688)} our supplications{H8469} before{H6440} thee for our righteousnesses{H6666}, but for thy great{H7227} mercies{H7356}."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord{H136}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)}; O Lord{H136}, forgive{H5545}{(H8798)}; O Lord{H136}, hearken{H7181}{(H8685)} and do{H6213}{(H8798)}; defer{H309}{(H8762)} not{H408}, for thine own sake, O my God{H430}: for thy city{H5892} and thy people{H5971} are called{H7121}{(H8738)} by thy name{H8034}."
Daniel,9,20,"And whiles I was speaking{H1696}{(H8764)}, and praying{H6419}{(H8693)}, and confessing{H3034}{(H8693)} my sin{H2403} and the sin{H2403} of my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}, and presenting{H5307}{(H8688)} my supplication{H8467} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} my God{H430} for the holy{H6944} mountain{H2022} of my God{H430};"
Daniel,9,21,"Yea, whiles I was speaking{H1696}{(H8764)} in prayer{H8605}, even the man{H376} Gabriel{H1403}, whom I had seen{H7200}{(H8804)} in the vision{H2377} at the beginning{H8462}, being caused to fly{H3286}{(H8716)} swiftly{H3288}, touched{H5060}{(H8802)} me about the time{H6256} of the evening{H6153} oblation{H4503}."
Daniel,9,22,"And he informed{H995}{(H8799)} me, and talked{H1696}{(H8762)} with me, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O Daniel{H1840}, I am now come forth{H3318}{(H8804)} to give thee skill{H7919}{(H8687)} and understanding{H998}."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning{H8462} of thy supplications{H8469} the commandment{H1697} came forth{H3318}{(H8804)}, and I am come{H935}{(H8804)} to shew{H5046}{(H8687)} thee; for thou art greatly beloved{H2532}: therefore understand{H995}{(H8798)} the matter{H1697}, and consider{H995}{(H8685)} the vision{H4758}."
Daniel,9,24,"Seventy{H7657} weeks{H7620} are determined{H2852}{(H8738)} upon thy people{H5971} and upon thy holy{H6944} city{H5892}, to finish{H3607}{(H8763)} the transgression{H6588}, and to make an end{H8552}{(H8687)}{(H8675)}{H2856}{(H8800)} of sins{H2403}, and to make reconciliation{H3722}{(H8763)} for iniquity{H5771}, and to bring in{H935}{(H8687)} everlasting{H5769} righteousness{H6664}, and to seal up{H2856}{(H8800)} the vision{H2377} and prophecy{H5030}, and to anoint{H4886}{(H8800)} the most{H6944} Holy{H6944}."
Daniel,9,25,"Know{H3045}{(H8799)} therefore and understand{H7919}{(H8686)}, that from the going forth{H4161} of the commandment{H1697} to restore{H7725}{(H8687)} and to build{H1129}{(H8800)} Jerusalem{H3389} unto the Messiah{H4899} the Prince{H5057} shall be seven{H7651} weeks{H7620}, and threescore{H8346} and two{H8147} weeks{H7620}: the street{H7339} shall be built{H1129}{(H8738)} again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and the wall{H2742}, even in troublous{H6695} times{H6256}."
Daniel,9,26,"And after{H310} threescore{H8346} and two{H8147} weeks{H7620} shall Messiah{H4899} be cut off{H3772}{(H8735)}, but not for himself: and the people{H5971} of the prince{H5057} that shall come{H935}{(H8802)} shall destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} the city{H5892} and the sanctuary{H6944}; and the end{H7093} thereof shall be with a flood{H7858}, and unto the end{H7093} of the war{H4421} desolations{H8074}{(H8802)} are determined{H2782}{(H8737)}."
Daniel,9,27,"And he shall confirm{H1396}{(H8689)} the covenant{H1285} with many{H7227} for one{H259} week{H7620}: and in the midst{H2677} of the week{H7620} he shall cause the sacrifice{H2077} and the oblation{H4503} to cease{H7673}{(H8686)}, and for the overspreading{H3671} of abominations{H8251} he shall make it desolate{H8074}{(H8789)}, even until the consummation{H3617}, and that determined{H2782}{(H8737)} shall be poured{H5413}{(H8799)} upon the desolate{H8074}{(H8802)}."
Daniel,10,1,"In the third{H7969} year{H8141} of Cyrus{H3566} king{H4428} of Persia{H6539} a thing{H1697} was revealed{H1540}{(H8738)} unto Daniel{H1840}, whose name{H8034} was called{H7121}{(H8738)} Belteshazzar{H1095}; and the thing{H1697} was true{H571}, but the time appointed{H6635} was long{H1419}: and he understood{H995}{(H8804)} the thing{H1697}, and had understanding{H998} of the vision{H4758}."
Daniel,10,2,In those days{H3117} I Daniel{H1840} was mourning{H56}{(H8693)} three{H7969} full{H3117} weeks{H7620}.
Daniel,10,3,"I ate{H398}{(H8804)} no pleasant{H2532} bread{H3899}, neither came{H935}{(H8804)} flesh{H1320} nor wine{H3196} in my mouth{H6310}, neither did I anoint{H5480}{(H8804)} myself at all{H5480}{(H8800)}, till three{H7969} whole{H3117} weeks{H7620} were fulfilled{H4390}{(H8800)}."
Daniel,10,4,"And in the four{H702} and twentieth{H6242} day{H3117} of the first{H7223} month{H2320}, as I was by the side{H3027} of the great{H1419} river{H5104}, which is Hiddekel{H2313};"
Daniel,10,5,"Then I lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and behold a certain{H259} man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} in linen{H906}, whose loins{H4975} were girded{H2296}{(H8803)} with fine gold{H3800} of Uphaz{H210}:"
Daniel,10,6,"His body{H1472} also was like the beryl{H8658}, and his face{H6440} as the appearance{H4758} of lightning{H1300}, and his eyes{H5869} as lamps{H3940} of fire{H784}, and his arms{H2220} and his feet{H4772} like in colour{H5869} to polished{H7044} brass{H5178}, and the voice{H6963} of his words{H1697} like the voice{H6963} of a multitude{H1995}."
Daniel,10,7,"And I Daniel{H1840} alone saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the vision{H4759}: for the men{H582} that were with me saw{H7200}{(H8804)} not the vision{H4759}; but{H61} a great{H1419} quaking{H2731} fell{H5307}{(H8804)} upon them, so that they fled{H1272}{(H8799)} to hide{H2244}{(H8736)} themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone{H7604}{(H8738)}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} this great{H1419} vision{H4759}, and there remained{H7604}{(H8738)} no strength{H3581} in me: for my comeliness{H1935} was turned{H2015}{(H8738)} in me into corruption{H4889}, and I retained{H6113}{(H8804)} no strength{H3581}."
Daniel,10,9,"Yet heard{H8085}{(H8799)} I the voice{H6963} of his words{H1697}: and when I heard{H8085}{(H8800)} the voice{H6963} of his words{H1697}, then was I in a deep sleep{H7290}{(H8737)} on my face{H6440}, and my face{H6440} toward the ground{H776}."
Daniel,10,10,"And, behold, an hand{H3027} touched{H5060}{(H8804)} me, which set{H5128}{(H8686)} me upon my knees{H1290} and upon the palms{H3709} of my hands{H3027}."
Daniel,10,11,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, O Daniel{H1840}, a man{H376} greatly beloved{H2532}, understand{H995}{(H8685)} the words{H1697} that I speak{H1696}{(H8802)} unto thee, and stand{H5975}{(H8798)} upright{H5977}: for unto thee am I now sent{H7971}{(H8795)}. And when he had spoken{H1696}{(H8763)} this word{H1697} unto me, I stood{H5975}{(H8804)} trembling{H7460}{(H8688)}."
Daniel,10,12,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not, Daniel{H1840}: for from the first{H7223} day{H3117} that thou didst set{H5414}{(H8804)} thine heart{H3820} to understand{H995}{(H8687)}, and to chasten{H6031}{(H8692)} thyself before{H6440} thy God{H430}, thy words{H1697} were heard{H8085}{(H8738)}, and I am come{H935}{(H8804)} for thy words{H1697}."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince{H8269} of the kingdom{H4438} of Persia{H6539} withstood{H5975}{(H8802)} me one{H259} and twenty{H6242} days{H3117}: but, lo, Michael{H4317}, one{H259} of the chief{H7223} princes{H8269}, came{H935}{(H8804)} to help{H5826}{(H8800)} me; and I remained{H3498}{(H8738)} there with{H681} the kings{H4428} of Persia{H6539}."
Daniel,10,14,Now I am come{H935}{(H8804)} to make thee understand{H995}{(H8687)} what shall befall{H7136}{(H8799)} thy people{H5971} in the latter{H319} days{H3117}: for yet the vision{H2377} is for many days{H3117}.
Daniel,10,15,"And when he had spoken{H1696}{(H8763)} such words{H1697} unto me, I set{H5414}{(H8804)} my face{H6440} toward the ground{H776}, and I became dumb{H481}{(H8738)}."
Daniel,10,16,"And, behold, one like the similitude{H1823} of the sons{H1121} of men{H120} touched{H5060}{(H8802)} my lips{H8193}: then I opened{H6605}{(H8799)} my mouth{H6310}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before me, O my lord{H113}, by the vision{H4759} my sorrows{H6735} are turned{H2015}{(H8738)} upon me, and I have retained{H6113}{(H8804)} no strength{H3581}."
Daniel,10,17,"For how{H1963} can{H3201}{(H8799)} the servant{H5650} of this my lord{H113} talk{H1696}{(H8763)} with this my lord{H113}? for as for me, straightway{H6258} there remained{H5975}{(H8799)} no strength{H3581} in me, neither is there breath{H5397} left{H7604}{(H8738)} in me."
Daniel,10,18,"Then there came again{H3254}{(H8686)} and touched{H5060}{(H8799)} me one like the appearance{H4758} of a man{H120}, and he strengthened{H2388}{(H8762)} me,"
Daniel,10,19,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, O man{H376} greatly beloved{H2532}, fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not: peace{H7965} be unto thee, be strong{H2388}{(H8798)}, yea, be strong{H2388}{(H8798)}. And when he had spoken{H1696}{(H8763)} unto me, I was strengthened{H2388}{(H8694)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let my lord{H113} speak{H1696}{(H8762)}; for thou hast strengthened{H2388}{(H8765)} me."
Daniel,10,20,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he, Knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou wherefore I come{H935}{(H8804)} unto thee? and now will I return{H7725}{(H8799)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with the prince{H8269} of Persia{H6539}: and when I am gone forth{H3318}{(H8802)}, lo, the prince{H8269} of Grecia{H3120} shall come{H935}{(H8804)}."
Daniel,10,21,"But{H61} I will shew{H5046}{(H8686)} thee that which is noted{H7559}{(H8803)} in the scripture{H3791} of truth{H571}: and there is none{H259} that holdeth{H2388}{(H8693)} with me in these things, but Michael{H4317} your prince{H8269}."
Daniel,11,1,"Also I in the first{H259} year{H8141} of Darius{H1867} the Mede{H4075}, even I, stood{H5977} to confirm{H2388}{(H8688)} and to strengthen{H4581} him."
Daniel,11,2,"And now will I shew{H5046}{(H8686)} thee the truth{H571}. Behold, there shall stand up{H5975}{(H8802)} yet three{H7969} kings{H4428} in Persia{H6539}; and the fourth{H7243} shall be far{H6239} richer{H6238}{(H8686)} than they all{H1419}: and by his strength{H2393} through his riches{H6239} he shall stir up{H5782}{(H8686)} all against the realm{H4438} of Grecia{H3120}."
Daniel,11,3,"And a mighty{H1368} king{H4428} shall stand up{H5975}{(H8804)}, that shall rule{H4910}{(H8804)} with great{H7227} dominion{H4474}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} according to his will{H7522}."
Daniel,11,4,"And when he shall stand up{H5975}{(H8800)}, his kingdom{H4438} shall be broken{H7665}{(H8735)}, and shall be divided{H2673}{(H8735)} toward the four{H702} winds{H7307} of heaven{H8064}; and not to his posterity{H319}, nor according to his dominion{H4915} which he ruled{H4910}{(H8804)}: for his kingdom{H4438} shall be plucked up{H5428}{(H8735)}, even for others{H312} beside those."
Daniel,11,5,"And the king{H4428} of the south{H5045} shall be strong{H2388}{(H8799)}, and one of his princes{H8269}; and he shall be strong{H2388}{(H8799)} above him, and have dominion{H4910}{(H8804)}; his dominion{H4475} shall be a great{H7227} dominion{H4474}."
Daniel,11,6,"And in the end{H7093} of years{H8141} they shall join themselves together{H2266}{(H8691)}; for the king's{H4428} daughter{H1323} of the south{H5045} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of the north{H6828} to make{H6213}{(H8800)} an agreement{H4339}: but she shall not retain{H6113}{(H8799)} the power{H3581} of the arm{H2220}; neither shall he stand{H5975}{(H8799)}, nor his arm{H2220}: but she shall be given up{H5414}{(H8735)}, and they that brought{H935}{(H8688)} her, and he that begat{H3205}{(H8802)} her, and he that strengthened{H2388}{(H8688)} her in these times{H6256}."
Daniel,11,7,"But out of a branch{H5342} of her roots{H8328} shall one stand up{H5975}{(H8804)} in his estate{H3653}, which shall come{H935}{(H8799)} with an army{H2428}, and shall enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the fortress{H4581} of the king{H4428} of the north{H6828}, and shall deal{H6213}{(H8804)} against them, and shall prevail{H2388}{(H8689)}:"
Daniel,11,8,"And shall also carry{H935}{(H8686)} captives{H7628} into Egypt{H4714} their gods{H430}, with their princes{H5257}, and with their precious{H2532} vessels{H3627} of silver{H3701} and of gold{H2091}; and he shall continue{H5975}{(H8799)} more years{H8141} than the king{H4428} of the north{H6828}."
Daniel,11,9,"So the king{H4428} of the south{H5045} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} into his kingdom{H4438}, and shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} into his own land{H127}."
Daniel,11,10,"But his sons{H1121} shall be stirred up{H1624}{(H8691)}, and shall assemble{H622}{(H8804)} a multitude{H1995} of great{H7227} forces{H2428}: and one shall certainly{H935}{(H8800)} come{H935}{(H8804)}, and overflow{H7857}{(H8804)}, and pass through{H5674}{(H8804)}: then shall he return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and be stirred up{H1624}{(H8691)}, even to his fortress{H4581}."
Daniel,11,11,"And the king{H4428} of the south{H5045} shall be moved with choler{H4843}{(H8698)}, and shall come forth{H3318}{(H8804)} and fight{H3898}{(H8738)} with him, even with the king{H4428} of the north{H6828}: and he shall set forth{H5975}{(H8689)} a great{H7227} multitude{H1995}; but the multitude{H1995} shall be given{H5414}{(H8738)} into his hand{H3027}."
Daniel,11,12,"And when he hath taken away{H5375}{(H8738)} the multitude{H1995}, his heart{H3824} shall be lifted up{H7311}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H7311}{(H8799)}; and he shall cast down{H5307}{(H8689)} many ten thousands{H7239}: but he shall not be strengthened{H5810}{(H8799)} by it."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king{H4428} of the north{H6828} shall return{H7725}{(H8804)}, and shall set forth{H5975}{(H8689)} a multitude{H1995} greater{H7227} than the former{H7223}, and shall certainly{H935}{(H8800)} come{H935}{(H8799)} after{H7093} certain{H6256} years{H8141} with a great{H1419} army{H2428} and with much{H7227} riches{H7399}."
Daniel,11,14,And in those times{H6256} there shall many{H7227} stand up{H5975}{(H8799)} against the king{H4428} of the south{H5045}: also the robbers{H1121}{H6530} of thy people{H5971} shall exalt{H5375}{(H8691)} themselves to establish{H5975}{(H8687)} the vision{H2377}; but they shall fall{H3782}{(H8738)}.
Daniel,11,15,"So the king{H4428} of the north{H6828} shall come{H935}{(H8799)}, and cast up{H8210}{(H8799)} a mount{H5550}, and take{H3920}{(H8804)} the most fenced{H4013} cities{H5892}: and the arms{H2220} of the south{H5045} shall not withstand{H5975}{(H8799)}, neither his chosen{H4005} people{H5971}, neither shall there be any strength{H3581} to withstand{H5975}{(H8800)}."
Daniel,11,16,"But he that cometh{H935}{(H8802)} against him shall do{H6213}{(H8799)} according to his own will{H7522}, and none shall stand{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} him: and he shall stand{H5975}{(H8799)} in the glorious{H6643} land{H776}, which by his hand{H3027} shall be consumed{H3617}."
Daniel,11,17,"He shall also set{H7760}{(H8799)} his face{H6440} to enter{H935}{(H8800)} with the strength{H8633} of his whole kingdom{H4438}, and upright ones{H3477} with him; thus shall he do{H6213}{(H8804)}: and he shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} him the daughter{H1323} of women{H802}, corrupting{H7843}{(H8687)} her: but she shall not stand{H5975}{(H8799)} on his side, neither be for him."
Daniel,11,18,"After this shall he turn{H7760}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H7725}{(H8686)} his face{H6440} unto the isles{H339}, and shall take{H3920}{(H8804)} many{H7227}: but a prince{H7101} for his own behalf shall cause the reproach{H2781} offered by him to cease{H7673}{(H8689)}; without{H1115} his own reproach{H2781} he shall cause it to turn{H7725}{(H8686)} upon him."
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn{H7725}{(H8686)} his face{H6440} toward the fort{H4581} of his own land{H776}: but he shall stumble{H3782}{(H8738)} and fall{H5307}{(H8804)}, and not be found{H4672}{(H8735)}."
Daniel,11,20,"Then shall stand up{H5975}{(H8804)} in his estate{H3653} a raiser{H5674}{(H8688)} of taxes{H5065}{(H8802)} in the glory{H1925} of the kingdom{H4438}: but within few{H259} days{H3117} he shall be destroyed{H7665}{(H8735)}, neither in anger{H639}, nor in battle{H4421}."
Daniel,11,21,"And in his estate{H3653} shall stand up{H5975}{(H8804)} a vile person{H959}{(H8737)}, to whom they shall not give{H5414}{(H8804)} the honour{H1935} of the kingdom{H4438}: but he shall come{H935}{(H8804)} in peaceably{H7962}, and obtain{H2388}{(H8689)} the kingdom{H4438} by flatteries{H2519}."
Daniel,11,22,"And with the arms{H2220} of a flood{H7858} shall they be overflown{H7857}{(H8735)} from before{H6440} him, and shall be broken{H7665}{(H8735)}; yea, also the prince{H5057} of the covenant{H1285}."
Daniel,11,23,"And after the league{H2266}{(H8692)} made with him he shall work{H6213}{(H8799)} deceitfully{H4820}: for he shall come up{H5927}{(H8804)}, and shall become strong{H6105}{(H8804)} with a small{H4592} people{H1471}."
Daniel,11,24,"He shall enter{H935}{(H8799)} peaceably{H7962} even upon the fattest places{H4924} of the province{H4082}; and he shall do{H6213}{(H8804)} that which his fathers{H1} have not done{H6213}{(H8804)}, nor his fathers{H1}' fathers{H1}; he shall scatter{H967}{(H8799)} among them the prey{H961}, and spoil{H7998}, and riches{H7399}: yea, and he shall forecast{H2803}{(H8762)} his devices{H4284} against the strong holds{H4013}, even for a time{H6256}."
Daniel,11,25,And he shall stir up{H5782}{(H8686)} his power{H3581} and his courage{H3824} against the king{H4428} of the south{H5045} with a great{H1419} army{H2428}; and the king{H4428} of the south{H5045} shall be stirred up{H1624}{(H8691)} to battle{H4421} with a very{H3966} great{H1419} and mighty{H6099} army{H2428}; but he shall not stand{H5975}{(H8799)}: for they shall forecast{H2803}{(H8799)} devices{H4284} against him.
Daniel,11,26,"Yea, they that feed{H398}{(H8802)} of the portion of his meat{H6598} shall destroy{H7665}{(H8799)} him, and his army{H2428} shall overflow{H7857}{(H8799)}: and many{H7227} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} down slain{H2491}."
Daniel,11,27,"And both{H8147} these kings{H4428}' hearts{H3824} shall be to do mischief{H4827}{(H8688)}{H7451}, and they shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} lies{H3577} at one{H259} table{H7979}; but it shall not prosper{H6743}{(H8799)}: for yet the end{H7093} shall be at the time appointed{H4150}."
Daniel,11,28,"Then shall he return{H7725}{(H8804)} into his land{H776} with great{H1419} riches{H7399}; and his heart{H3824} shall be against the holy{H6944} covenant{H1285}; and he shall do{H6213}{(H8804)} exploits, and return{H7725}{(H8799)} to his own land{H776}."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time appointed{H4150} he shall return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and come{H935}{(H8804)} toward the south{H5045}; but it shall not be as the former{H7223}, or as the latter{H314}."
Daniel,11,30,"For the ships{H6716} of Chittim{H3794} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} against him: therefore he shall be grieved{H3512}{(H8738)}, and return{H7725}{(H8804)}, and have indignation{H2194}{(H8804)} against the holy{H6944} covenant{H1285}: so shall he do{H6213}{(H8804)}; he shall even return{H7725}{(H8804)}, and have intelligence{H995}{(H8799)} with them that forsake{H5800}{(H8802)} the holy{H6944} covenant{H1285}."
Daniel,11,31,"And arms{H2220} shall stand{H5975}{(H8799)} on his part, and they shall pollute{H2490}{(H8765)} the sanctuary{H4720} of strength{H4581}, and shall take away{H5493}{(H8689)} the daily{H8548} sacrifice, and they shall place{H5414}{(H8804)} the abomination{H8251} that maketh desolate{H8074}{(H8789)}."
Daniel,11,32,"And such as do wickedly{H7561}{(H8688)} against the covenant{H1285} shall he corrupt{H2610}{(H8686)} by flatteries{H2514}: but the people{H5971} that do know{H3045}{(H8802)} their God{H430} shall be strong{H2388}{(H8686)}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} exploits."
Daniel,11,33,"And they that understand{H7919}{(H8688)} among the people{H5971} shall instruct{H995}{(H8799)} many{H7227}: yet they shall fall{H3782}{(H8738)} by the sword{H2719}, and by flame{H3852}, by captivity{H7628}, and by spoil{H961}, many days{H3117}."
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they shall fall{H3782}{(H8736)}, they shall be holpen{H5826}{(H8735)} with a little{H4592} help{H5828}: but many{H7227} shall cleave{H3867}{(H8738)} to them with flatteries{H2519}."
Daniel,11,35,"And some of them of understanding{H7919}{(H8688)} shall fall{H3782}{(H8735)}, to try{H6884}{(H8800)} them, and to purge{H1305}{(H8763)}, and to make them white{H3835}{(H8687)}, even to the time{H6256} of the end{H7093}: because it is yet for a time appointed{H4150}."
Daniel,11,36,"And the king{H4428} shall do{H6213}{(H8804)} according to his will{H7522}; and he shall exalt{H7311}{(H8709)} himself, and magnify{H1431}{(H8691)} himself above every god{H410}, and shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} marvellous things{H6381}{(H8737)} against the God{H410} of gods{H410}, and shall prosper{H6743}{(H8689)} till the indignation{H2195} be accomplished{H3615}{(H8804)}: for that that is determined{H2782}{(H8737)} shall be done{H6213}{(H8738)}."
Daniel,11,37,"Neither shall he regard{H995}{(H8799)} the God{H430} of his fathers{H1}, nor the desire{H2532} of women{H802}, nor regard{H995}{(H8799)} any god{H433}: for he shall magnify{H1431}{(H8691)} himself above all."
Daniel,11,38,"But in his estate{H3653} shall he honour{H3513}{(H8762)} the God{H433} of forces{H4581}: and a god{H433} whom his fathers{H1} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not shall he honour{H3513}{(H8762)} with gold{H2091}, and silver{H3701}, and with precious{H3368} stones{H68}, and pleasant things{H2532}."
Daniel,11,39,"Thus shall he do{H6213}{(H8804)} in the most strong{H4581} holds{H4013} with a strange{H5236} god{H433}, whom he shall acknowledge{H5234}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H5234}{(H8689)} and increase{H7235}{(H8686)} with glory{H3519}: and he shall cause them to rule{H4910}{(H8689)} over many{H7227}, and shall divide{H2505}{(H8762)} the land{H127} for gain{H4242}."
Daniel,11,40,"And at the time{H6256} of the end{H7093} shall the king{H4428} of the south{H5045} push{H5055}{(H8691)} at him: and the king{H4428} of the north{H6828} shall come against him like a whirlwind{H8175}{(H8691)}, with chariots{H7393}, and with horsemen{H6571}, and with many{H7227} ships{H591}; and he shall enter{H935}{(H8804)} into the countries{H776}, and shall overflow{H7857}{(H8804)} and pass over{H5674}{(H8804)}."
Daniel,11,41,"He shall enter{H935}{(H8804)} also into the glorious{H6643} land{H776}, and many{H7227} countries shall be overthrown{H3782}{(H8735)}: but these shall escape{H4422}{(H8735)} out of his hand{H3027}, even Edom{H123}, and Moab{H4124}, and the chief{H7225} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}."
Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} also upon the countries{H776}: and the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} shall not escape{H6413}.
Daniel,11,43,"But he shall have power{H4910}{(H8804)} over the treasures{H4362} of gold{H2091} and of silver{H3701}, and over all the precious{H2532} things of Egypt{H4714}: and the Libyans{H3864} and the Ethiopians{H3569} shall be at his steps{H4703}."
Daniel,11,44,"But tidings{H8052} out of the east{H4217} and out of the north{H6828} shall trouble{H926}{(H8762)} him: therefore he shall go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} with great{H1419} fury{H2534} to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)}, and utterly to make away{H2763}{(H8687)} many{H7227}."
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant{H5193}{(H8799)} the tabernacles{H168} of his palace{H643} between the seas{H3220} in the glorious{H6643} holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}; yet he shall come{H935}{(H8804)} to his end{H7093}, and none shall help{H5826}{(H8802)} him."
Daniel,12,1,"And at that time{H6256} shall Michael{H4317} stand up{H5975}{(H8799)}, the great{H1419} prince{H8269} which standeth{H5975}{(H8802)} for the children{H1121} of thy people{H5971}: and there shall be{H1961}{(H8738)} a time{H6256} of trouble{H6869}, such as never was since there was a nation{H1471} even to that same time{H6256}: and at that time{H6256} thy people{H5971} shall be delivered{H4422}{(H8735)}, every one that shall be found{H4672}{(H8737)} written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the book{H5612}."
Daniel,12,2,"And many{H7227} of them that sleep{H3463} in the dust{H6083} of the earth{H127} shall awake{H6974}{(H8686)}, some to everlasting{H5769} life{H2416}, and some to shame{H2781} and everlasting{H5769} contempt{H1860}."
Daniel,12,3,And they that be wise{H7919}{(H8688)} shall shine{H2094}{(H8686)} as the brightness{H2096} of the firmament{H7549}; and they that turn many{H7227} to righteousness{H6663}{(H8688)} as the stars{H3556} for ever{H5769} and ever{H5703}.
Daniel,12,4,"But thou, O Daniel{H1840}, shut up{H5640}{(H8798)} the words{H1697}, and seal{H2856}{(H8798)} the book{H5612}, even to the time{H6256} of the end{H7093}: many{H7227} shall run to and fro{H7751}{(H8787)}, and knowledge{H1847} shall be increased{H7235}{(H8799)}."
Daniel,12,5,"Then I Daniel{H1840} looked{H7200}{(H8804)}, and, behold, there stood{H5975}{(H8802)} other{H312} two{H8147}, the one{H259} on this side{H2008} of the bank{H8193} of the river{H2975}, and the other{H259} on that side of the bank{H8193} of the river{H2975}."
Daniel,12,6,"And one said{H559}{(H8799)} to the man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} in linen{H906}, which was upon{H4605} the waters{H4325} of the river{H2975}, How long shall it be to the end{H7093} of these wonders{H6382}?"
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} in linen{H906}, which was upon{H4605} the waters{H4325} of the river{H2975}, when he held up{H7311}{(H8686)} his right hand{H3225} and his left hand{H8040} unto heaven{H8064}, and sware{H7650}{(H8735)} by him that liveth{H2416} for ever{H5769} that it shall be for a time{H4150}, times{H4150}, and an half{H2677}; and when he shall have accomplished{H3615}{(H8763)} to scatter{H5310}{(H8763)} the power{H3027} of the holy{H6944} people{H5971}, all these things shall be finished{H3615}{(H8799)}."
Daniel,12,8,"And I heard{H8085}{(H8804)}, but I understood{H995}{(H8799)} not: then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, O my Lord{H113}, what shall be the end{H319} of these things?"
Daniel,12,9,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go thy way{H3212}{(H8798)}, Daniel{H1840}: for the words{H1697} are closed up{H5640}{(H8803)} and sealed{H2856}{(H8803)} till the time{H6256} of the end{H7093}."
Daniel,12,10,"Many{H7227} shall be purified{H1305}{(H8691)}, and made white{H3835}{(H8691)}, and tried{H6884}{(H8735)}; but the wicked{H7563} shall do wickedly{H7561}{(H8689)}: and none of the wicked{H7563} shall understand{H995}{(H8799)}; but the wise{H7919}{(H8688)} shall understand{H995}{(H8799)}."
Daniel,12,11,"And from the time{H6256} that the daily{H8548} sacrifice shall be taken away{H5493}{(H8717)}, and the abomination{H8251} that maketh desolate{H8074}{(H8802)} set up{H5414}{(H8800)}, there shall be a thousand{H505} two hundred{H3967} and ninety{H8673} days{H3117}."
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed{H835} is he that waiteth{H2442}{(H8764)}, and cometh{H5060}{(H8686)} to the thousand{H505} three{H7969} hundred{H3967} and five{H2568} and thirty{H7970} days{H3117}."
Daniel,12,13,"But go thou thy way{H3212}{(H8798)} till the end{H7093} be: for thou shalt rest{H5117}{(H8799)}, and stand{H5975}{(H8799)} in thy lot{H1486} at the end{H7093} of the days{H3117}."
Hosea,1,1,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} that came unto Hosea{H1954}, the son{H1121} of Beeri{H882}, in the days{H3117} of Uzziah{H5818}, Jotham{H3147}, Ahaz{H271}, and Hezekiah{H3169}, kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and in the days{H3117} of Jeroboam{H3379} the son{H1121} of Joash{H3101}, king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}."
Hosea,1,2,"The beginning{H8462} of the word{H1696}{(H8763)} of the LORD{H3068} by Hosea{H1954}. And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Hosea{H1954}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} unto thee a wife{H802} of whoredoms{H2183} and children{H3206} of whoredoms{H2183}: for the land{H776} hath committed great{H2181}{(H8800)} whoredom{H2181}{(H8799)}, departing from{H310} the LORD{H3068}."
Hosea,1,3,"So he went{H3212}{(H8799)} and took{H3947}{(H8799)} Gomer{H1586} the daughter{H1323} of Diblaim{H1691}; which conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} him a son{H1121}."
Hosea,1,4,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} his name{H8034} Jezreel{H3157}; for yet a little{H4592} while, and I will avenge{H6485}{(H8804)} the blood{H1818} of Jezreel{H3157} upon the house{H1004} of Jehu{H3058}, and will cause to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} the kingdom{H4468} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day{H3117}, that I will break{H7665}{(H8804)} the bow{H7198} of Israel{H3478} in the valley{H6010} of Jezreel{H3157}."
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a daughter{H1323}. And God said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} her name{H8034} Loruhamah{H3819}{(H8795)}: for I will no more{H3254}{(H8686)} have mercy{H7355}{(H8762)} upon the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; but I will utterly{H5375}{(H8800)} take them away{H5375}{(H8799)}."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy{H7355}{(H8762)} upon the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, and will save{H3467}{(H8689)} them by the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and will not save{H3467}{(H8686)} them by bow{H7198}, nor by sword{H2719}, nor by battle{H4421}, by horses{H5483}, nor by horsemen{H6571}."
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned{H1580}{(H8799)} Loruhamah{H3819}{(H8795)}, she conceived{H2029}{(H8799)}, and bare{H3205}{(H8799)} a son{H1121}."
Hosea,1,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} God, Call{H7121}{(H8798)} his name{H8034} Loammi{H3818}: for ye are not my people{H5971}, and I will not be your God."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number{H4557} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} shall be as the sand{H2344} of the sea{H3220}, which cannot be measured{H4058}{(H8735)} nor numbered{H5608}{(H8735)}; and it shall come to pass, that in the place{H4725} where it was said{H559}{(H8735)} unto them, Ye are not my people{H5971}, there it shall be said{H559}{(H8735)} unto them, Ye are the sons{H1121} of the living{H2416} God{H410}."
Hosea,1,11,"Then shall the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} and the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} be gathered{H6908}{(H8738)} together{H3162}, and appoint{H7760}{(H8804)} themselves one{H259} head{H7218}, and they shall come up{H5927}{(H8804)} out of the land{H776}: for great{H1419} shall be the day{H3117} of Jezreel{H3157}."
Hosea,2,1,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} ye unto your brethren{H251}, Ammi{H5971}; and to your sisters{H269}, Ruhamah{H7355}{(H8795)}."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead{H7378}{(H8798)} with your mother{H517}, plead{H7378}{(H8798)}: for she is not my wife{H802}, neither am I her husband{H376}: let her therefore put away{H5493}{(H8686)} her whoredoms{H2183} out of her sight{H6440}, and her adulteries{H5005} from between her breasts{H7699};"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip{H6584}{(H8686)} her naked{H6174}, and set{H3322}{(H8689)} her as in the day{H3117} that she was born{H3205}{(H8736)}, and make{H7760}{(H8804)} her as a wilderness{H4057}, and set{H7896}{(H8804)} her like a dry{H6723} land{H776}, and slay{H4191}{(H8689)} her with thirst{H6772}."
Hosea,2,4,And I will not have mercy{H7355}{(H8762)} upon her children{H1121}; for they be the children{H1121} of whoredoms{H2183}.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother{H517} hath played the harlot{H2181}{(H8804)}: she that conceived{H2029}{(H8802)} them hath done shamefully{H3001}{(H8689)}: for she said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will go{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} my lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, that give{H5414}{(H8802)} me my bread{H3899} and my water{H4325}, my wool{H6785} and my flax{H6593}, mine oil{H8081} and my drink{H8250}."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge{H7753}{(H8801)} up thy way{H1870} with thorns{H5518}, and make{H1443}{(H8804)} a wall{H1447}, that she shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} her paths{H5410}."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall follow{H7291}{(H8765)} after her lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, but she shall not overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} them; and she shall seek{H1245}{(H8765)} them, but shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} them: then shall she say{H559}{(H8804)}, I will go{H3212}{(H8799)} and return{H7725}{(H8799)} to my first{H7223} husband{H376}; for then was it better{H2896} with me than now{H6258}."
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} her corn{H1715}, and wine{H8492}, and oil{H3323}, and multiplied{H7235}{(H8689)} her silver{H3701} and gold{H2091}, which they prepared{H6213}{(H8804)} for Baal{H1168}."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and take away{H3947}{(H8804)} my corn{H1715} in the time{H6256} thereof, and my wine{H8492} in the season{H4150} thereof, and will recover{H5337}{(H8689)} my wool{H6785} and my flax{H6593} given to cover{H3680}{(H8763)} her nakedness{H6172}."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I discover{H1540}{(H8762)} her lewdness{H5040} in the sight{H5869} of her lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, and none{H376} shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} her out of mine hand{H3027}."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth{H4885} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)}, her feast days{H2282}, her new moons{H2320}, and her sabbaths{H7676}, and all her solemn feasts{H4150}."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will destroy{H8074}{(H8689)} her vines{H1612} and her fig trees{H8384}, whereof she hath said{H559}{(H8804)}, These are my rewards{H866} that my lovers{H157}{(H8764)} have given{H5414}{(H8804)} me: and I will make{H7760}{(H8804)} them a forest{H3293}, and the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704} shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit{H6485}{(H8804)} upon her the days{H3117} of Baalim{H1168}, wherein she burned incense{H6999}{(H8686)} to them, and she decked{H5710}{(H8799)} herself with her earrings{H5141} and her jewels{H2484}, and she went{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} her lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, and forgat{H7911}{(H8804)} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure{H6601}{(H8764)} her, and bring{H3212}{(H8689)} her into the wilderness{H4057}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} comfortably{H3820} unto her."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} her her vineyards{H3754} from thence, and the valley{H6010} of Achor{H5911} for a door{H6607} of hope{H8615}: and she shall sing{H6030}{(H8804)} there, as in the days{H3117} of her youth{H5271}, and as in the day{H3117} when she came up{H5927}{(H8800)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be at that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that thou shalt call{H7121}{(H8799)} me Ishi{H376}; and shalt call{H7121}{(H8799)} me no more Baali{H1180}."
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away{H5493}{(H8689)} the names{H8034} of Baalim{H1168} out of her mouth{H6310}, and they shall no more be remembered{H2142}{(H8735)} by their name{H8034}."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day{H3117} will I make{H3772}{(H8804)} a covenant{H1285} for them with the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704}, and with the fowls{H5775} of heaven{H8064}, and with the creeping things{H7431} of the ground{H127}: and I will break{H7665}{(H8799)} the bow{H7198} and the sword{H2719} and the battle{H4421} out of the earth{H776}, and will make them to lie down{H7901}{(H8689)} safely{H983}."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth{H781}{(H8765)} thee unto me for ever{H5769}; yea, I will betroth{H781}{(H8765)} thee unto me in righteousness{H6664}, and in judgment{H4941}, and in lovingkindness{H2617}, and in mercies{H7356}."
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth{H781}{(H8765)} thee unto me in faithfulness{H530}: and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}.
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day{H3117}, I will hear{H6030}{(H8799)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, I will hear{H6030}{(H8799)} the heavens{H8064}, and they shall hear{H6030}{(H8799)} the earth{H776};"
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth{H776} shall hear{H6030}{(H8799)} the corn{H1715}, and the wine{H8492}, and the oil{H3323}; and they shall hear{H6030}{(H8799)} Jezreel{H3157}."
Hosea,2,23,"And I will sow{H2232}{(H8804)} her unto me in the earth{H776}; and I will have mercy{H7355}{(H8765)} upon her that had not obtained mercy{H7355}{(H8795)}{(H8677)}{H3818}; and I will say{H559}{(H8804)} to them which were not my people{H5971}, Thou art my people{H5971}; and they shall say{H559}{(H8799)}, Thou art my God{H430}."
Hosea,3,1,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} unto me, Go{H3212}{(H8798)} yet, love{H157}{(H8798)} a woman{H802} beloved{H157}{(H8803)} of her friend{H7453}, yet an adulteress{H5003}{(H8764)}, according to the love{H160} of the LORD{H3068} toward the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, who look{H6437}{(H8802)} to other{H312} gods{H430}, and love{H157}{(H8802)} flagons{H809} of wine{H6025}."
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought{H3739}{(H8799)} her to me for fifteen{H6240}{H2568} pieces of silver{H3701}, and for an homer{H2563} of barley{H8184}, and an half homer{H3963} of barley{H8184}:"
Hosea,3,3,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto her, Thou shalt abide{H3427}{(H8799)} for me many{H7227} days{H3117}; thou shalt not play the harlot{H2181}{(H8799)}, and thou shalt not be{H1961}{(H8799)} for another man{H376}: so will I also be for thee."
Hosea,3,4,"For the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} shall abide{H3427}{(H8799)} many{H7227} days{H3117} without a king{H4428}, and without a prince{H8269}, and without a sacrifice{H2077}, and without an image{H4676}, and without an ephod{H646}, and without teraphim{H8655}:"
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward{H310} shall the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and seek{H1245}{(H8765)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and David{H1732} their king{H4428}; and shall fear{H6342}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} and his goodness{H2898} in the latter{H319} days{H3117}."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, ye children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: for the LORD{H3068} hath a controversy{H7379} with the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}, because there is no truth{H571}, nor mercy{H2617}, nor knowledge{H1847} of God{H430} in the land{H776}."
Hosea,4,2,"By swearing{H422}{(H8800)}, and lying{H3584}{(H8763)}, and killing{H7523}{(H8800)}, and stealing{H1589}{(H8800)}, and committing adultery{H5003}{(H8800)}, they break out{H6555}{(H8804)}, and blood{H1818} toucheth{H5060}{(H8804)} blood{H1818}."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore shall the land{H776} mourn{H56}{(H8799)}, and every one that dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} therein shall languish{H535}{(H8797)}, with the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704}, and with the fowls{H5775} of heaven{H8064}; yea, the fishes{H1709} of the sea{H3220} also shall be taken away{H622}{(H8735)}."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man{H376} strive{H7378}{(H8799)}, nor reprove{H3198}{(H8686)} another{H376}: for thy people{H5971} are as they that strive{H7378}{(H8688)} with the priest{H3548}."
Hosea,4,5,"Therefore shalt thou fall{H3782}{(H8804)} in the day{H3117}, and the prophet{H5030} also shall fall{H3782}{(H8804)} with thee in the night{H3915}, and I will destroy{H1820}{(H8804)} thy mother{H517}."
Hosea,4,6,"My people{H5971} are destroyed{H1820}{(H8738)} for lack of knowledge{H1847}: because thou hast rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} knowledge{H1847}, I will also reject{H3988}{(H8799)} thee, that thou shalt be no priest{H3547}{(H8763)} to me: seeing thou hast forgotten{H7911}{(H8799)} the law{H8451} of thy God{H430}, I will also forget{H7911}{(H8799)} thy children{H1121}."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were increased{H7230}, so they sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against me: therefore will I change{H4171}{(H8686)} their glory{H3519} into shame{H7036}."
Hosea,4,8,"They eat up{H398}{(H8799)} the sin{H2403} of my people{H5971}, and they set{H5375}{(H8799)} their heart{H5315} on their iniquity{H5771}."
Hosea,4,9,"And there shall be, like people{H5971}, like priest{H3548}: and I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} them for their ways{H1870}, and reward{H7725}{(H8686)} them their doings{H4611}."
Hosea,4,10,"For they shall eat{H398}{(H8804)}, and not have enough{H7646}{(H8799)}: they shall commit whoredom{H2181}{(H8689)}, and shall not increase{H6555}{(H8799)}: because they have left off{H5800}{(H8804)} to take heed{H8104}{(H8800)} to the LORD{H3068}."
Hosea,4,11,Whoredom{H2184} and wine{H3196} and new wine{H8492} take away{H3947}{(H8799)} the heart{H3820}.
Hosea,4,12,"My people{H5971} ask{H7592}{(H8799)} counsel at their stocks{H6086}, and their staff{H4731} declareth{H5046}{(H8686)} unto them: for the spirit{H7307} of whoredoms{H2183} hath caused them to err{H8582}{(H8689)}, and they have gone a whoring{H2181}{(H8799)} from under their God{H430}."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice{H2076}{(H8762)} upon the tops{H7218} of the mountains{H2022}, and burn incense{H6999}{(H8762)} upon the hills{H1389}, under oaks{H437} and poplars{H3839} and elms{H424}, because the shadow{H6738} thereof is good{H2896}: therefore your daughters{H1323} shall commit whoredom{H2181}{(H8799)}, and your spouses{H3618} shall commit adultery{H5003}{(H8762)}."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish{H6485}{(H8799)} your daughters{H1323} when they commit whoredom{H2181}{(H8799)}, nor your spouses{H3618} when they commit adultery{H5003}{(H8762)}: for themselves are separated{H6504}{(H8762)} with whores{H2181}{(H8802)}, and they sacrifice{H2076}{(H8762)} with harlots{H6948}: therefore the people{H5971} that doth not understand{H995}{(H8799)} shall fall{H3832}{(H8735)}."
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel{H3478}, play the harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, yet let not Judah{H3063} offend{H816}{(H8799)}; and come{H935}{(H8799)} not ye unto Gilgal{H1537}, neither go ye up{H5927}{(H8799)} to Bethaven{H1007}, nor swear{H7650}{(H8735)}, The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}."
Hosea,4,16,For Israel{H3478} slideth back{H5637}{(H8804)} as a backsliding{H5637}{(H8802)} heifer{H6510}: now the LORD{H3068} will feed{H7462}{(H8799)} them as a lamb{H3532} in a large place{H4800}.
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim{H669} is joined{H2266}{(H8803)} to idols{H6091}: let him alone{H3240}{(H8685)}.
Hosea,4,18,"Their drink{H5435} is sour{H5493}{(H8804)}: they have committed whoredom{H2181}{(H8689)} continually{H2181}{(H8687)}: her rulers{H4043} with shame{H7036} do love{H157}{(H8804)}, Give{H3051}{(H8798)} ye."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind{H7307} hath bound her up{H6887}{(H8804)} in her wings{H3671}, and they shall be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)} because of their sacrifices{H2077}."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye this, O priests{H3548}; and hearken{H7181}{(H8685)}, ye house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; and give ye ear{H238}{(H8685)}, O house{H1004} of the king{H4428}; for judgment{H4941} is toward you, because ye have been a snare{H6341} on Mizpah{H4709}, and a net{H7568} spread{H6566}{(H8803)} upon Tabor{H8396}."
Hosea,5,2,"And the revolters{H7846} are profound{H6009}{(H8689)} to make slaughter{H7819}{(H8800)}, though I have been a rebuker{H4148} of them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know{H3045}{(H8804)} Ephraim{H669}, and Israel{H3478} is not hid{H3582}{(H8738)} from me: for now, O Ephraim{H669}, thou committest whoredom{H2181}{(H8689)}, and Israel{H3478} is defiled{H2930}{(H8738)}."
Hosea,5,4,"They will not frame{H5414}{(H8799)} their doings{H4611} to turn{H7725}{(H8800)} unto their God{H430}: for the spirit{H7307} of whoredoms{H2183} is in the midst{H7130} of them, and they have not known{H3045}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Hosea,5,5,And the pride{H1347} of Israel{H3478} doth testify{H6030}{(H8804)} to his face{H6440}: therefore shall Israel{H3478} and Ephraim{H669} fall{H3782}{(H8735)} in their iniquity{H5771}; Judah{H3063} also shall fall{H3782}{(H8804)} with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} with their flocks{H6629} and with their herds{H1241} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} the LORD{H3068}; but they shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} him; he hath withdrawn{H2502}{(H8804)} himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt treacherously{H898}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}: for they have begotten{H3205}{(H8804)} strange{H2114}{(H8801)} children{H1121}: now shall a month{H2320} devour{H398}{(H8799)} them with their portions{H2506}.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow{H8628}{(H8798)} ye the cornet{H7782} in Gibeah{H1390}, and the trumpet{H2689} in Ramah{H7414}: cry aloud{H7321}{(H8685)} at Bethaven{H1007}, after{H310} thee, O Benjamin{H1144}."
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim{H669} shall be desolate{H8047} in the day{H3117} of rebuke{H8433}: among the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} have I made known{H3045}{(H8689)} that which shall surely be{H539}{(H8737)}.
Hosea,5,10,The princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063} were like them that remove{H5253}{(H8688)} the bound{H1366}: therefore I will pour out{H8210}{(H8799)} my wrath{H5678} upon them like water{H4325}.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim{H669} is oppressed{H6231}{(H8803)} and broken{H7533}{(H8803)} in judgment{H4941}, because he willingly{H2974}{(H8689)} walked{H1980}{(H8804)} after{H310} the commandment{H6673}."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore will I be unto Ephraim{H669} as a moth{H6211}, and to the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} as rottenness{H7538}."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim{H669} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} his sickness{H2483}, and Judah{H3063} saw his wound{H4205}, then went{H3212}{(H8799)} Ephraim{H669} to the Assyrian{H804}, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to king{H4428} Jareb{H3377}{(H8677)}{H7378}{(H8799)}: yet could{H3201}{(H8799)} he not heal{H7495}{(H8800)} you, nor cure{H1455}{(H8799)} you of your wound{H4205}."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be unto Ephraim{H669} as a lion{H7826}, and as a young lion{H3715} to the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}: I, even I, will tear{H2963}{(H8799)} and go away{H3212}{(H8799)}; I will take away{H5375}{(H8799)}, and none shall rescue{H5337}{(H8688)} him."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go{H3212}{(H8799)} and return{H7725}{(H8799)} to my place{H4725}, till they acknowledge their offence{H816}{(H8799)}, and seek{H1245}{(H8765)} my face{H6440}: in their affliction{H6862} they will seek me early{H7836}{(H8762)}."
Hosea,6,1,"Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}: for he hath torn{H2963}{(H8804)}, and he will heal{H7495}{(H8799)} us; he hath smitten{H5221}{(H8686)}, and he will bind us up{H2280}{(H8799)}."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days{H3117} will he revive{H2421}{(H8762)} us: in the third{H7992} day{H3117} he will raise us up{H6965}{(H8686)}, and we shall live{H2421}{(H8799)} in his sight{H6440}."
Hosea,6,3,"Then shall we know{H3045}{(H8799)}, if we follow{H7291}{(H8799)} on to know{H3045}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068}: his going forth{H4161} is prepared{H3559}{(H8737)} as the morning{H7837}; and he shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto us as the rain{H1653}, as the latter{H4456} and former rain{H3384}{(H8802)} unto the earth{H776}."
Hosea,6,4,"O Ephraim{H669}, what shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto thee? O Judah{H3063}, what shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto thee? for your goodness{H2617} is as a morning{H1242} cloud{H6051}, and as the early{H7925}{(H8688)} dew{H2919} it goeth away{H1980}{(H8802)}."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore have I hewed{H2672}{(H8804)} them by the prophets{H5030}; I have slain{H2026}{(H8804)} them by the words{H561} of my mouth{H6310}: and thy judgments{H4941} are as the light{H216} that goeth forth{H3318}{(H8799)}.
Hosea,6,6,"For I desired{H2654}{(H8804)} mercy{H2617}, and not sacrifice{H2077}; and the knowledge{H1847} of God{H430} more than burnt offerings{H5930}."
Hosea,6,7,But they like men{H120} have transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} the covenant{H1285}: there have they dealt treacherously{H898}{(H8804)} against me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead{H1568} is a city{H7151} of them that work{H6466}{(H8802)} iniquity{H205}, and is polluted{H6121} with blood{H1818}."
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops{H1416} of robbers wait{H2442}{(H8763)} for a man{H376}, so the company{H2267} of priests{H3548} murder{H7523}{(H8762)} in the way{H1870} by consent{H7926}{(H8677)}{H7927}: for they commit{H6213}{(H8804)} lewdness{H2154}."
Hosea,6,10,"I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} an horrible thing{H8186} in the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}: there is the whoredom{H2184} of Ephraim{H669}, Israel{H3478} is defiled{H2930}{(H8738)}."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah{H3063}, he hath set{H7896}{(H8804)} an harvest{H7105} for thee, when I returned{H7725}{(H8800)} the captivity{H7622} of my people{H5971}."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would have healed{H7495}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478}, then the iniquity{H5771} of Ephraim{H669} was discovered{H1540}{(H8738)}, and the wickedness{H7451} of Samaria{H8111}: for they commit{H6466}{(H8804)} falsehood{H8267}; and the thief{H1590} cometh in{H935}{(H8799)}, and the troop{H1416} of robbers spoileth{H6584}{(H8804)} without{H2351}."
Hosea,7,2,And they consider{H559}{(H8799)} not in their hearts{H3824} that I remember{H2142}{(H8804)} all their wickedness{H7451}: now their own doings{H4611} have beset them about{H5437}{(H8804)}; they are before my face{H6440}.
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king{H4428} glad{H8055}{(H8762)} with their wickedness{H7451}, and the princes{H8269} with their lies{H3585}."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers{H5003}{(H8764)}, as an oven{H8574} heated{H1197}{(H8802)} by the baker{H644}{(H8802)}, who ceaseth{H7673}{(H8799)} from raising{H5782}{(H8800)} after he hath kneaded{H3888}{(H8800)} the dough{H1217}, until it be leavened{H2556}{(H8800)}."
Hosea,7,5,In the day{H3117} of our king{H4428} the princes{H8269} have made him sick{H2470}{(H8689)} with bottles{H2534} of wine{H3196}; he stretched out{H4900}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} with scorners{H3945}{(H8802)}.
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready{H7126}{(H8765)} their heart{H3820} like an oven{H8574}, whiles they lie in wait{H693}{(H8800)}: their baker{H644}{(H8802)} sleepeth{H3463} all the night{H3915}; in the morning{H1242} it burneth{H1197}{(H8802)} as a flaming{H3852} fire{H784}."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot{H2552}{(H8735)} as an oven{H8574}, and have devoured{H398}{(H8804)} their judges{H8199}{(H8802)}; all their kings{H4428} are fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}: there is none among them that calleth{H7121}{(H8802)} unto me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim{H669}, he hath mixed{H1101}{(H8704)} himself among the people{H5971}; Ephraim{H669} is a cake{H5692} not turned{H2015}{(H8803)}."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} have devoured{H398}{(H8804)} his strength{H3581}, and he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} it not: yea, gray hairs{H7872} are here and there{H2236}{(H8804)} upon him, yet he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} not."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride{H1347} of Israel{H3478} testifieth{H6030}{(H8804)} to his face{H6440}: and they do not return{H7725}{(H8804)} to the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, nor seek{H1245}{(H8765)} him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"Ephraim{H669} also is like a silly{H6601}{(H8802)} dove{H3123} without heart{H3820}: they call{H7121}{(H8804)} to Egypt{H4714}, they go{H1980}{(H8804)} to Assyria{H804}."
Hosea,7,12,"When they shall go{H3212}{(H8799)}, I will spread{H6566}{(H8799)} my net{H7568} upon them; I will bring them down{H3381}{(H8686)} as the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064}; I will chastise{H3256}{(H8686)} them, as their congregation{H5712} hath heard{H8088}."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe{H188} unto them! for they have fled{H5074}{(H8804)} from me: destruction{H7701} unto them! because they have transgressed{H6586}{(H8804)} against me: though I have redeemed{H6299}{(H8799)} them, yet they have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} lies{H3577} against me."
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried{H2199}{(H8804)} unto me with their heart{H3820}, when they howled{H3213}{(H8686)} upon their beds{H4904}: they assemble{H1481}{(H8709)} themselves for corn{H1715} and wine{H8492}, and they rebel{H5493}{(H8799)} against me."
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have bound{H3256}{(H8765)} and strengthened{H2388}{(H8765)} their arms{H2220}, yet do they imagine{H2803}{(H8762)} mischief{H7451} against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return{H7725}{(H8799)}, but not to the most High{H5920}: they are like a deceitful{H7423} bow{H7198}: their princes{H8269} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719} for the rage{H2195} of their tongue{H3956}: this{H2097} shall be their derision{H3933} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Hosea,8,1,"Set the trumpet{H7782} to thy mouth{H2441}. He shall come as an eagle{H5404} against the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, because they have transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} my covenant{H1285}, and trespassed{H6586}{(H8804)} against my law{H8451}."
Hosea,8,2,"Israel{H3478} shall cry{H2199}{(H8799)} unto me, My God{H430}, we know{H3045}{(H8804)} thee."
Hosea,8,3,Israel{H3478} hath cast off{H2186}{(H8804)} the thing that is good{H2896}: the enemy{H341}{(H8802)} shall pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings{H4427}{(H8689)}, but not by me: they have made princes{H7786}{(H8689)}, and I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} it not: of their silver{H3701} and their gold{H2091} have they made{H6213}{(H8804)} them idols{H6091}, that they may be cut off{H3772}{(H8735)}."
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf{H5695}, O Samaria{H8111}, hath cast{H2186}{(H8804)} thee off; mine anger{H639} is kindled{H2734}{(H8804)} against them: how long will it be ere{H3808} they attain{H3201}{(H8799)} to innocency{H5356}?"
Hosea,8,6,For from Israel{H3478} was it also: the workman{H2796} made{H6213}{(H8804)} it; therefore it is not God{H430}: but the calf{H5695} of Samaria{H8111} shall be broken in pieces{H7616}.
Hosea,8,7,"For they have sown{H2232}{(H8799)} the wind{H7307}, and they shall reap{H7114}{(H8799)} the whirlwind{H5492}: it hath no stalk{H7054}: the bud{H6780} shall yield{H6213}{(H8799)} no meal{H7058}: if{H194} so be it yield{H6213}{(H8799)}, the strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} shall swallow it up{H1104}{(H8799)}."
Hosea,8,8,Israel{H3478} is swallowed up{H1104}{(H8738)}: now shall they be among the Gentiles{H1471} as a vessel{H3627} wherein is no pleasure{H2656}.
Hosea,8,9,"For they are gone up{H5927}{(H8804)} to Assyria{H804}, a wild ass{H6501} alone{H909}{(H8802)} by himself: Ephraim{H669} hath hired{H8566}{(H8689)} lovers{H158}."
Hosea,8,10,"Yea, though they have hired{H8566}{(H8799)} among the nations{H1471}, now will I gather{H6908}{(H8762)} them, and they shall sorrow{H2490}{(H8686)} a little{H4592} for the burden{H4853} of the king{H4428} of princes{H8269}."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim{H669} hath made many{H7235}{(H8689)} altars{H4196} to sin{H2398}{(H8800)}, altars{H4196} shall be unto him to sin{H2398}{(H8800)}."
Hosea,8,12,"I have written{H3789}{(H8799)} to him the great things{H7230}{(H8675)}{H7239} of my law{H8451}, but they were counted{H2803}{(H8738)} as a strange thing{H2114}{(H8801)}."
Hosea,8,13,"They sacrifice{H2076}{(H8799)} flesh{H1320} for the sacrifices{H2077} of mine offerings{H1890}, and eat{H398}{(H8799)} it; but the LORD{H3068} accepteth{H7521}{(H8804)} them not; now will he remember{H2142}{(H8799)} their iniquity{H5771}, and visit{H6485}{(H8799)} their sins{H2403}: they shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} to Egypt{H4714}."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel{H3478} hath forgotten{H7911}{(H8799)} his Maker{H6213}{(H8802)}, and buildeth{H1129}{(H8799)} temples{H1964}; and Judah{H3063} hath multiplied{H7235}{(H8689)} fenced{H1219}{(H8803)} cities{H5892}: but I will send{H7971}{(H8765)} a fire{H784} upon his cities{H5892}, and it shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} the palaces{H759} thereof."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} not, O Israel{H3478}, for joy{H1524}, as other people{H5971}: for thou hast gone a whoring{H2181}{(H8804)} from thy God{H430}, thou hast loved{H157}{(H8804)} a reward{H868} upon every cornfloor{H1637}{H1715}."
Hosea,9,2,"The floor{H1637} and the winepress{H3342} shall not feed{H7462}{(H8799)} them, and the new wine{H8492} shall fail{H3584}{(H8762)} in her."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in the LORD'S{H3068} land{H776}; but Ephraim{H669} shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} to Egypt{H4714}, and they shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} unclean{H2931} things in Assyria{H804}."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not offer{H5258}{(H8799)} wine{H3196} offerings to the LORD{H3068}, neither shall they be pleasing{H6149}{(H8799)} unto him: their sacrifices{H2077} shall be unto them as the bread{H3899} of mourners{H205}; all that eat{H398}{(H8802)} thereof shall be polluted{H2930}{(H8691)}: for their bread{H3899} for their soul{H5315} shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do{H6213}{(H8799)} in the solemn{H4150} day{H3117}, and in the day{H3117} of the feast{H2282} of the LORD{H3068}?"
Hosea,9,6,"For, lo, they are gone{H1980}{(H8804)} because of destruction{H7701}: Egypt{H4714} shall gather them up{H6908}{(H8762)}, Memphis{H4644} shall bury{H6912}{(H8762)} them: the pleasant{H4261} places for their silver{H3701}, nettles{H7057} shall possess{H3423}{(H8799)} them: thorns{H2336} shall be in their tabernacles{H168}."
Hosea,9,7,"The days{H3117} of visitation{H6486} are come{H935}{(H8804)}, the days{H3117} of recompence{H7966} are come{H935}{(H8804)}; Israel{H3478} shall know{H3045}{(H8799)} it: the prophet{H5030} is a fool{H191}, the spiritual{H7307} man{H376} is mad{H7696}{(H8794)}, for the multitude{H7230} of thine iniquity{H5771}, and the great{H7227} hatred{H4895}."
Hosea,9,8,"The watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} of Ephraim{H669} was with my God{H430}: but the prophet{H5030} is a snare{H6341} of a fowler{H3352} in all his ways{H1870}, and hatred{H4895} in the house{H1004} of his God{H430}."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply{H6009}{(H8689)} corrupted{H7843}{(H8765)} themselves, as in the days{H3117} of Gibeah{H1390}: therefore he will remember{H2142}{(H8799)} their iniquity{H5771}, he will visit{H6485}{(H8799)} their sins{H2403}."
Hosea,9,10,"I found{H4672}{(H8804)} Israel{H3478} like grapes{H6025} in the wilderness{H4057}; I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} your fathers{H1} as the firstripe{H1063} in the fig tree{H8384} at her first time{H7225}: but they went{H935}{(H8804)} to Baalpeor{H1187}, and separated{H5144}{(H8735)} themselves unto that shame{H1322}; and their abominations{H8251} were according as they loved{H157}{(H8800)}."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim{H669}, their glory{H3519} shall fly away{H5774}{(H8709)} like a bird{H5775}, from the birth{H3205}{(H8800)}, and from the womb{H990}, and from the conception{H2032}."
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up{H1431}{(H8762)} their children{H1121}, yet will I bereave{H7921}{(H8765)} them, that there shall not be a man{H120} left: yea, woe{H188} also to them when I depart{H5493}{(H8800)} from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim{H669}, as I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} Tyrus{H6865}, is planted{H8362}{(H8803)} in a pleasant place{H5116}: but Ephraim{H669} shall bring forth{H3318}{(H8687)} his children{H1121} to the murderer{H2026}{(H8802)}."
Hosea,9,14,"Give{H5414}{(H8798)} them, O LORD{H3068}: what wilt thou give{H5414}{(H8799)}? give{H5414}{(H8798)} them a miscarrying{H7921}{(H8688)} womb{H7358} and dry{H6784}{(H8802)} breasts{H7699}."
Hosea,9,15,"All their wickedness{H7451} is in Gilgal{H1537}: for there I hated{H8130}{(H8804)} them: for the wickedness{H7455} of their doings{H4611} I will drive them out{H1644}{(H8762)} of mine house{H1004}, I will love{H160} them no more{H3254}{(H8686)}: all their princes{H8269} are revolters{H5637}{(H8802)}."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim{H669} is smitten{H5221}{(H8717)}, their root{H8328} is dried up{H3001}{(H8804)}, they shall bear{H6213}{(H8799)} no fruit{H6529}: yea, though they bring forth{H3205}{(H8799)}, yet will I slay{H4191}{(H8689)} even the beloved{H4261} fruit of their womb{H990}."
Hosea,9,17,"My God{H430} will cast them away{H3988}{(H8799)}, because they did not hearken{H8085}{(H8804)} unto him: and they shall be wanderers{H5074}{(H8802)} among the nations{H1471}."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel{H3478} is an empty{H1238}{(H8802)} vine{H1612}, he bringeth forth{H7737}{(H8762)} fruit{H6529} unto himself: according to the multitude{H7230} of his fruit{H6529} he hath increased{H7235}{(H8689)} the altars{H4196}; according to the goodness{H2896} of his land{H776} they have made goodly{H2895}{(H8689)} images{H4676}."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart{H3820} is divided{H2505}{(H8804)}; now shall they be found faulty{H816}{(H8799)}: he shall break down{H6202}{(H8799)} their altars{H4196}, he shall spoil{H7703}{(H8779)} their images{H4676}."
Hosea,10,3,"For now they shall say{H559}{(H8799)}, We have no king{H4428}, because we feared{H3372}{(H8804)} not the LORD{H3068}; what then should a king{H4428} do{H6213}{(H8799)} to us?"
Hosea,10,4,"They have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} words{H1697}, swearing{H422}{(H8800)} falsely{H7723} in making{H3772}{(H8800)} a covenant{H1285}: thus judgment{H4941} springeth up{H6524}{(H8804)} as hemlock{H7219} in the furrows{H8525} of the field{H7704}."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants{H7934} of Samaria{H8111} shall fear{H1481}{(H8799)} because of the calves{H5697} of Bethaven{H1007}: for the people{H5971} thereof shall mourn{H56}{(H8804)} over it, and the priests{H3649} thereof that rejoiced{H1523}{(H8799)} on it, for the glory{H3519} thereof, because it is departed{H1540}{(H8804)} from it."
Hosea,10,6,"It shall be also carried{H2986}{(H8714)} unto Assyria{H804} for a present{H4503} to king{H4428} Jareb{H3377}: Ephraim{H669} shall receive{H3947}{(H8799)} shame{H1317}, and Israel{H3478} shall be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)} of his own counsel{H6098}."
Hosea,10,7,"As for Samaria{H8111}, her king{H4428} is cut off{H1820}{(H8738)} as the foam{H7110} upon{H6440} the water{H4325}."
Hosea,10,8,"The high places{H1116} also of Aven{H206}, the sin{H2403} of Israel{H3478}, shall be destroyed{H8045}{(H8738)}: the thorn{H6975} and the thistle{H1863} shall come up{H5927}{(H8799)} on their altars{H4196}; and they shall say{H559}{(H8804)} to the mountains{H2022}, Cover{H3680}{(H8761)} us; and to the hills{H1389}, Fall{H5307}{(H8798)} on us."
Hosea,10,9,"O Israel{H3478}, thou hast sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} from the days{H3117} of Gibeah{H1390}: there they stood{H5975}{(H8804)}: the battle{H4421} in Gibeah{H1390} against the children{H1121} of iniquity{H5932} did not overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} them."
Hosea,10,10,"It is in my desire{H185} that I should chastise{H3256}{(H8799)} them; and the people{H5971} shall be gathered{H622}{(H8795)} against them, when they shall bind{H631}{(H8800)} themselves in their two{H8147} furrows{H5869}."
Hosea,10,11,"And Ephraim{H669} is as an heifer{H5697} that is taught{H3925}{(H8794)}, and loveth{H157}{(H8802)} to tread out{H1758}{(H8800)} the corn; but I passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} upon her fair{H2898} neck{H6677}: I will make Ephraim{H669} to ride{H7392}{(H8686)}; Judah{H3063} shall plow{H2790}{(H8799)}, and Jacob{H3290} shall break his clods{H7702}{(H8762)}."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow{H2232}{(H8798)} to yourselves in righteousness{H6666}, reap{H7114}{(H8798)} in{H6310} mercy{H2617}; break up{H5214}{(H8798)} your fallow ground{H5215}: for it is time{H6256} to seek{H1875}{(H8800)} the LORD{H3068}, till he come{H935}{(H8799)} and rain{H3384}{(H8686)} righteousness{H6664} upon you."
Hosea,10,13,"Ye have plowed{H2790}{(H8804)} wickedness{H7562}, ye have reaped{H7114}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}; ye have eaten{H398}{(H8804)} the fruit{H6529} of lies{H3585}: because thou didst trust{H982}{(H8804)} in thy way{H1870}, in the multitude{H7230} of thy mighty men{H1368}."
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore shall a tumult{H7588} arise{H6965}{(H8804)} among thy people{H5971}, and all thy fortresses{H4013} shall be spoiled{H7703}{(H8714)}, as Shalman{H8020} spoiled{H7701} Betharbel{H1009} in the day{H3117} of battle{H4421}: the mother{H517} was dashed in pieces{H7376}{(H8795)} upon her children{H1121}."
Hosea,10,15,So{H3602} shall Bethel{H1008} do{H6213}{(H8804)} unto you because{H6440} of your great{H7451} wickedness{H7451}: in a morning{H7837} shall the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478} utterly{H1820}{(H8736)} be cut off{H1820}{(H8738)}.
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel{H3478} was a child{H5288}, then I loved{H157}{(H8799)} him, and called{H7121}{(H8804)} my son{H1121} out of Egypt{H4714}."
Hosea,11,2,"As they called{H7121}{(H8804)} them, so they went{H1980}{(H8804)} from them{H6440}: they sacrificed{H2076}{(H8762)} unto Baalim{H1168}, and burned incense{H6999}{(H8762)} to graven images{H6456}."
Hosea,11,3,"I taught{H8637} Ephraim{H669} also to go{H8637}{(H8809)}, taking{H3947}{(H8800)} them by their arms{H2220}; but they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that I healed{H7495}{(H8804)} them."
Hosea,11,4,"I drew{H4900}{(H8799)} them with cords{H2256} of a man{H120}, with bands{H5688} of love{H160}: and I was to them as they that take off{H7311}{(H8688)} the yoke{H5923} on their jaws{H3895}, and I laid{H5186}{(H8686)} meat{H398}{(H8686)} unto them."
Hosea,11,5,"He shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)} into the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, but the Assyrian{H804} shall be his king{H4428}, because they refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to return{H7725}{(H8800)}."
Hosea,11,6,"And the sword{H2719} shall abide{H2342}{(H8804)} on his cities{H5892}, and shall consume{H3615}{(H8765)} his branches{H905}, and devour{H398}{(H8804)} them, because of their own counsels{H4156}."
Hosea,11,7,"And my people{H5971} are bent{H8511}{(H8803)} to backsliding{H4878} from me: though they called{H7121}{(H8799)} them to the most High{H5920}, none at all{H3162} would exalt{H7311}{(H8787)} him."
Hosea,11,8,"How shall I give thee up{H5414}{(H8799)}, Ephraim{H669}? how shall I deliver{H4042}{(H8762)} thee, Israel{H3478}? how shall I make{H5414}{(H8799)} thee as Admah{H126}? how shall I set{H7760}{(H8799)} thee as Zeboim{H6636}? mine heart{H3820} is turned{H2015}{(H8738)} within me, my repentings{H5150} are kindled{H3648}{(H8738)} together{H3162}."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute{H6213}{(H8799)} the fierceness{H2740} of mine anger{H639}, I will not return{H7725}{(H8799)} to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} Ephraim{H669}: for I am God{H410}, and not man{H376}; the Holy One{H6918} in the midst{H7130} of thee: and I will not enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the city{H5892}."
Hosea,11,10,"They shall walk{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} the LORD{H3068}: he shall roar{H7580}{(H8799)} like a lion{H738}: when he shall roar{H7580}{(H8799)}, then the children{H1121} shall tremble{H2729}{(H8799)} from the west{H3220}."
Hosea,11,11,"They shall tremble{H2729}{(H8799)} as a bird{H6833} out of Egypt{H4714}, and as a dove{H3123} out of the land{H776} of Assyria{H804}: and I will place{H3427}{(H8689)} them in their houses{H1004}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim{H669} compasseth{H5437}{(H8804)} me about with lies{H3585}, and the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} with deceit{H4820}: but Judah{H3063} yet ruleth{H7300}{(H8804)} with God{H410}, and is faithful{H539}{(H8737)} with the saints{H6918}."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim{H669} feedeth{H7462}{(H8802)} on wind{H7307}, and followeth{H7291}{(H8802)} after the east wind{H6921}: he daily{H3117} increaseth{H7235}{(H8686)} lies{H3577} and desolation{H7701}; and they do make{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with the Assyrians{H804}, and oil{H8081} is carried{H2986}{(H8714)} into Egypt{H4714}."
Hosea,12,2,"The LORD{H3068} hath also a controversy{H7379} with Judah{H3063}, and will punish{H6485}{(H8800)} Jacob{H3290} according to his ways{H1870}; according to his doings{H4611} will he recompense{H7725}{(H8686)} him."
Hosea,12,3,"He took his brother{H251} by the heel{H6117}{(H8804)} in the womb{H990}, and by his strength{H202} he had power{H8280}{(H8804)} with God{H430}:"
Hosea,12,4,"Yea, he had power{H7786}{(H8799)} over the angel{H4397}, and prevailed{H3201}{(H8799)}: he wept{H1058}{(H8804)}, and made supplication{H2603}{(H8691)} unto him: he found{H4672}{(H8799)} him in Bethel{H1008}, and there he spake{H1696}{(H8762)} with us;"
Hosea,12,5,Even the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635}; the LORD{H3068} is his memorial{H2143}.
Hosea,12,6,"Therefore turn{H7725}{(H8799)} thou to thy God{H430}: keep{H8104}{(H8798)} mercy{H2617} and judgment{H4941}, and wait{H6960}{(H8761)} on thy God{H430} continually{H8548}."
Hosea,12,7,"He is a merchant{H3667}, the balances{H3976} of deceit{H4820} are in his hand{H3027}: he loveth{H157}{(H8804)} to oppress{H6231}{(H8800)}."
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim{H669} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Yet I am become rich{H6238}{(H8804)}, I have found me out{H4672}{(H8804)} substance{H202}: in all my labours{H3018} they shall find{H4672}{(H8799)} none iniquity{H5771} in me that were sin{H2399}."
Hosea,12,9,"And I that am the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} from the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} will yet make thee to dwell{H3427}{(H8686)} in tabernacles{H168}, as in the days{H3117} of the solemn feast{H4150}."
Hosea,12,10,"I have also spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} by the prophets{H5030}, and I have multiplied{H7235}{(H8689)} visions{H2377}, and used similitudes{H1819}{(H8762)}, by the ministry{H3027} of the prophets{H5030}."
Hosea,12,11,"Is there iniquity{H205} in Gilead{H1568}? surely they are vanity{H7723}: they sacrifice{H2076}{(H8765)} bullocks{H7794} in Gilgal{H1537}; yea, their altars{H4196} are as heaps{H1530} in the furrows{H8525} of the fields{H7704}."
Hosea,12,12,"And Jacob{H3290} fled{H1272}{(H8799)} into the country{H7704} of Syria{H758}, and Israel{H3478} served{H5647}{(H8799)} for a wife{H802}, and for a wife{H802} he kept{H8104}{(H8804)} sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"And by a prophet{H5030} the LORD{H3068} brought{H5927}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478} out of Egypt{H4714}, and by a prophet{H5030} was he preserved{H8104}{(H8738)}."
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim{H669} provoked him to anger{H3707}{(H8689)} most bitterly{H8563}: therefore shall he leave{H5203}{(H8799)} his blood{H1818} upon him, and his reproach{H2781} shall his Lord{H113} return{H7725}{(H8686)} unto him."
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim{H669} spake{H1696}{(H8763)} trembling{H7578}, he exalted{H5375}{(H8804)} himself in Israel{H3478}; but when he offended{H816}{(H8799)} in Baal{H1168}, he died{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Hosea,13,2,"And now they sin{H2398}{(H8800)} more and more{H3254}{(H8686)}, and have made{H6213}{(H8799)} them molten images{H4541} of their silver{H3701}, and idols{H6091} according to their own understanding{H8394}, all of it the work{H4639} of the craftsmen{H2796}: they say{H559}{(H8802)} of them, Let the men{H120} that sacrifice{H2076}{(H8802)} kiss{H5401}{(H8799)} the calves{H5695}."
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they shall be as the morning{H1242} cloud{H6051}, and as the early{H7925}{(H8688)} dew{H2919} that passeth away{H1980}{(H8802)}, as the chaff{H4671} that is driven with the whirlwind{H5590}{(H8792)} out of the floor{H1637}, and as the smoke{H6227} out of the chimney{H699}."
Hosea,13,4,"Yet I am the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} from the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8799)} no god{H430} but me{H2108}: for there is no saviour{H3467}{(H8688)} beside me{H1115}."
Hosea,13,5,"I did know{H3045}{(H8804)} thee in the wilderness{H4057}, in the land{H776} of great drought{H8514}."
Hosea,13,6,"According to their pasture{H4830}, so were they filled{H7646}{(H8799)}; they were filled{H7646}{(H8804)}, and their heart{H3820} was exalted{H7311}{(H8799)}; therefore have they forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} me."
Hosea,13,7,Therefore I will be unto them as a lion{H7826}: as a leopard{H5246} by the way{H1870} will I observe{H7789}{(H8799)} them:
Hosea,13,8,"I will meet{H6298}{(H8799)} them as a bear{H1677} that is bereaved{H7909} of her whelps, and will rend{H7167}{(H8799)} the caul{H5458} of their heart{H3820}, and there will I devour{H398}{(H8799)} them like a lion{H3833}: the wild{H7704} beast{H2416} shall tear{H1234}{(H8762)} them."
Hosea,13,9,"O Israel{H3478}, thou hast destroyed{H7843}{(H8765)} thyself; but in me is thine help{H5828}."
Hosea,13,10,"I will{H165} be thy king{H4428}: where{H645} is any other that may save{H3467}{(H8686)} thee in all thy cities{H5892}? and thy judges{H8199}{(H8802)} of whom thou saidst{H559}{(H8804)}, Give{H5414}{(H8798)} me a king{H4428} and princes{H8269}?"
Hosea,13,11,"I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} thee a king{H4428} in mine anger{H639}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} him away in my wrath{H5678}."
Hosea,13,12,The iniquity{H5771} of Ephraim{H669} is bound up{H6887}{(H8803)}; his sin{H2403} is hid{H6845}{(H8803)}.
Hosea,13,13,The sorrows{H2256} of a travailing woman{H3205}{(H8802)} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} upon him: he is an unwise{H2450} son{H1121}; for he should not stay{H5975}{(H8799)} long{H6256} in the place of the breaking forth{H4866} of children{H1121}.
Hosea,13,14,"I will ransom{H6299}{(H8799)} them from the power{H3027} of the grave{H7585}; I will redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} them from death{H4194}: O death{H4194}, I will{H165} be thy plagues{H1698}; O grave{H7585}, I will{H165} be thy destruction{H6987}: repentance{H5164} shall be hid{H5641}{(H8735)} from mine eyes{H5869}."
Hosea,13,15,"Though he be fruitful{H6500}{(H8686)} among his brethren{H251}, an east wind{H6921} shall come{H935}{(H8799)}, the wind{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} shall come up{H5927}{(H8802)} from the wilderness{H4057}, and his spring{H4726} shall become dry{H954}{(H8799)}, and his fountain{H4599} shall be dried up{H2717}{(H8799)}: he shall spoil{H8154}{(H8799)} the treasure{H214} of all pleasant{H2532} vessels{H3627}."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria{H8111} shall become desolate{H816}{(H8799)}; for she hath rebelled{H4784}{(H8804)} against her God{H430}: they shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}: their infants{H5768} shall be dashed in pieces{H7376}{(H8792)}, and their women with child{H2030} shall be ripped up{H1234}{(H8792)}."
Hosea,14,1,"O Israel{H3478}, return{H7725}{(H8798)} unto the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}; for thou hast fallen{H3782}{(H8804)} by thine iniquity{H5771}."
Hosea,14,2,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} with you words{H1697}, and turn{H7725}{(H8798)} to the LORD{H3068}: say{H559}{(H8798)} unto him, Take away{H5375}{(H8799)} all iniquity{H5771}, and receive{H3947}{(H8798)} us graciously{H2896}: so will we render{H7999}{(H8762)} the calves{H6499} of our lips{H8193}."
Hosea,14,3,"Asshur{H804} shall not save{H3467}{(H8686)} us; we will not ride{H7392}{(H8799)} upon horses{H5483}: neither will we say{H559}{(H8799)} any more to the work{H4639} of our hands{H3027}, Ye are our gods{H430}: for in thee the fatherless{H3490} findeth mercy{H7355}{(H8792)}."
Hosea,14,4,"I will heal{H7495}{(H8799)} their backsliding{H4878}, I will love{H157}{(H8799)} them freely{H5071}: for mine anger{H639} is turned away{H7725}{(H8804)} from him."
Hosea,14,5,"I will be as the dew{H2919} unto Israel{H3478}: he shall grow{H6524}{(H8799)} as the lily{H7799}, and cast forth{H5221}{(H8686)} his roots{H8328} as Lebanon{H3844}."
Hosea,14,6,"His branches{H3127} shall spread{H3212}{(H8799)}, and his beauty{H1935} shall be as the olive tree{H2132}, and his smell{H7381} as Lebanon{H3844}."
Hosea,14,7,"They that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} under his shadow{H6738} shall return{H7725}{(H8799)}; they shall revive{H2421}{(H8762)} as the corn{H1715}, and grow{H6524}{(H8799)} as the vine{H1612}: the scent{H2143} thereof shall be as the wine{H3196} of Lebanon{H3844}."
Hosea,14,8,"Ephraim{H669} shall say, What have I to do any more with idols{H6091}? I have heard{H6030}{(H8804)} him, and observed{H7789}{(H8799)} him: I am like a green{H7488} fir tree{H1265}. From me is thy fruit{H6529} found{H4672}{(H8738)}."
Hosea,14,9,"Who is wise{H2450}, and he shall understand{H995}{(H8799)} these things? prudent{H995}{(H8737)}, and he shall know{H3045}{(H8799)} them? for the ways{H1870} of the LORD{H3068} are right{H3477}, and the just{H6662} shall walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in them: but the transgressors{H6586}{(H8802)} shall fall{H3782}{(H8735)} therein."
Joel,1,1,The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} that came to Joel{H3100} the son{H1121} of Pethuel{H6602}.
Joel,1,2,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} this, ye old men{H2205}, and give ear{H238}{(H8685)}, all ye inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}. Hath this been in your days{H3117}, or even{H518} in the days{H3117} of your fathers{H1}?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell{H5608}{(H8761)} ye your children{H1121} of it, and let your children{H1121} tell their children{H1121}, and their children{H1121} another{H312} generation{H1755}."
Joel,1,4,That which the palmerworm{H1501} hath left{H3499} hath the locust{H697} eaten{H398}{(H8804)}; and that which the locust{H697} hath left{H3499} hath the cankerworm{H3218} eaten{H398}{(H8804)}; and that which the cankerworm{H3218} hath left{H3499} hath the caterpiller{H2625} eaten{H398}{(H8804)}.
Joel,1,5,"Awake{H6974}{(H8685)}, ye drunkards{H7910}, and weep{H1058}{(H8798)}; and howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, all ye drinkers{H8354}{(H8802)} of wine{H3196}, because of the new wine{H6071}; for it is cut off{H3772}{(H8738)} from your mouth{H6310}."
Joel,1,6,"For a nation{H1471} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} upon my land{H776}, strong{H6099}, and without number{H4557}, whose teeth{H8127} are the teeth{H8127} of a lion{H738}, and he hath the cheek teeth{H4973} of a great lion{H3833}."
Joel,1,7,"He hath laid{H7760}{(H8804)} my vine{H1612} waste{H8047}, and barked{H7111} my fig tree{H8384}: he hath made it clean{H2834}{(H8800)} bare{H2834}{(H8804)}, and cast it away{H7993}{(H8689)}; the branches{H8299} thereof are made white{H3835}{(H8689)}."
Joel,1,8,Lament{H421}{(H8798)} like a virgin{H1330} girded{H2296}{(H8803)} with sackcloth{H8242} for the husband{H1167} of her youth{H5271}.
Joel,1,9,"The meat offering{H4503} and the drink offering{H5262} is cut off{H3772}{(H8717)} from the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}; the priests{H3548}, the LORD'S{H3068} ministers{H8334}{(H8764)}, mourn{H56}{(H8804)}."
Joel,1,10,"The field{H7704} is wasted{H7703}{(H8795)}, the land{H127} mourneth{H56}{(H8804)}; for the corn{H1715} is wasted{H7703}{(H8795)}: the new wine{H8492} is dried up{H3001}{(H8689)}, the oil{H3323} languisheth{H535}{(H8797)}."
Joel,1,11,"Be ye ashamed{H3001}{(H8685)}, O ye husbandmen{H406}; howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, O ye vinedressers{H3755}, for the wheat{H2406} and for the barley{H8184}; because the harvest{H7105} of the field{H7704} is perished{H6}{(H8804)}."
Joel,1,12,"The vine{H1612} is dried up{H3001}{(H8689)}, and the fig tree{H8384} languisheth{H535}{(H8797)}; the pomegranate{H7416} tree, the palm tree{H8558} also, and the apple tree{H8598}, even all the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704}, are withered{H3001}{(H8804)}: because joy{H8342} is withered away{H3001}{(H8689)} from the sons{H1121} of men{H120}."
Joel,1,13,"Gird{H2296}{(H8798)} yourselves, and lament{H5594}{(H8798)}, ye priests{H3548}: howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, ye ministers{H8334}{(H8764)} of the altar{H4196}: come{H935}{(H8798)}, lie all night{H3885}{(H8798)} in sackcloth{H8242}, ye ministers{H8334}{(H8764)} of my God{H430}: for the meat offering{H4503} and the drink offering{H5262} is withholden{H4513}{(H8738)} from the house{H1004} of your God{H430}."
Joel,1,14,"Sanctify{H6942}{(H8761)} ye a fast{H6685}, call{H7121}{(H8798)} a solemn assembly{H6116}, gather{H622}{(H8798)} the elders{H2205} and all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, and cry{H2199}{(H8798)} unto the LORD{H3068},"
Joel,1,15,"Alas{H162} for the day{H3117}! for the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is at hand{H7138}, and as a destruction{H7701} from the Almighty{H7706} shall it come{H935}{(H8799)}."
Joel,1,16,"Is not the meat{H400} cut off{H3772}{(H8738)} before our eyes{H5869}, yea, joy{H8057} and gladness{H1524} from the house{H1004} of our God{H430}?"
Joel,1,17,"The seed{H6507} is rotten{H5685}{(H8804)} under their clods{H4053}, the garners{H214} are laid desolate{H8074}{(H8738)}, the barns{H4460} are broken down{H2040}{(H8738)}; for the corn{H1715} is withered{H3001}{(H8689)}."
Joel,1,18,"How do the beasts{H929} groan{H584}{(H8737)}! the herds{H5739} of cattle{H1241} are perplexed{H943}{(H8738)}, because they have no pasture{H4829}; yea, the flocks{H5739} of sheep{H6629} are made desolate{H816}{(H8738)}."
Joel,1,19,"O LORD{H3068}, to thee will I cry{H7121}{(H8799)}: for the fire{H784} hath devoured{H398}{(H8804)} the pastures{H4999} of the wilderness{H4057}, and the flame{H3852} hath burned{H3857}{(H8765)} all the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704}."
Joel,1,20,"The beasts{H929} of the field{H7704} cry{H6165}{(H8799)} also unto thee: for the rivers{H650} of waters{H4325} are dried up{H3001}{(H8804)}, and the fire{H784} hath devoured{H398}{(H8804)} the pastures{H4999} of the wilderness{H4057}."
Joel,2,1,"Blow{H8628}{(H8798)} ye the trumpet{H7782} in Zion{H6726}, and sound an alarm{H7321}{(H8685)} in my holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}: let all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} tremble{H7264}{(H8799)}: for the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} cometh{H935}{(H8804)}, for it is nigh at hand{H7138};"
Joel,2,2,"A day{H3117} of darkness{H2822} and of gloominess{H653}, a day{H3117} of clouds{H6051} and of thick darkness{H6205}, as the morning{H7837} spread{H6566}{(H8803)} upon the mountains{H2022}: a great{H7227} people{H5971} and a strong{H6099}; there hath not been{H1961}{(H8738)} ever{H5769} the like, neither shall be any more{H3254}{(H8686)} after{H310} it, even to the years{H8141} of many{H1755} generations{H1755}."
Joel,2,3,"A fire{H784} devoureth{H398}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them; and behind{H310} them a flame{H3852} burneth{H3857}{(H8762)}: the land{H776} is as the garden{H1588} of Eden{H5731} before{H6440} them, and behind{H310} them a desolate{H8077} wilderness{H4057}; yea, and nothing shall escape{H6413} them."
Joel,2,4,"The appearance{H4758} of them is as the appearance{H4758} of horses{H5483}; and as horsemen{H6571}, so shall they run{H7323}{(H8799)}."
Joel,2,5,"Like the noise{H6963} of chariots{H4818} on the tops{H7218} of mountains{H2022} shall they leap{H7540}{(H8762)}, like the noise{H6963} of a flame{H3851} of fire{H784} that devoureth{H398}{(H8802)} the stubble{H7179}, as a strong{H6099} people{H5971} set in battle{H4421} array{H6186}{(H8803)}."
Joel,2,6,Before their face{H6440} the people{H5971} shall be much pained{H2342}{(H8799)}: all faces{H6440} shall gather{H6908}{(H8765)} blackness{H6289}.
Joel,2,7,"They shall run{H7323}{(H8799)} like mighty men{H1368}; they shall climb{H5927}{(H8799)} the wall{H2346} like men{H582} of war{H4421}; and they shall march{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} on his ways{H1870}, and they shall not break{H5670}{(H8762)} their ranks{H734}:"
Joel,2,8,"Neither shall one{H376} thrust{H1766}{(H8799)} another{H251}; they shall walk{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H1397} in his path{H4546}: and when they fall{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the sword{H7973}, they shall not be wounded{H1214}{(H8799)}."
Joel,2,9,"They shall run to and fro{H8264}{(H8799)} in the city{H5892}; they shall run{H7323}{(H8799)} upon the wall{H2346}, they shall climb up{H5927}{(H8799)} upon the houses{H1004}; they shall enter in{H935}{(H8799)} at the windows{H2474} like a thief{H1590}."
Joel,2,10,"The earth{H776} shall quake{H7264}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them; the heavens{H8064} shall tremble{H7493}{(H8804)}: the sun{H8121} and the moon{H3394} shall be dark{H6937}{(H8804)}, and the stars{H3556} shall withdraw{H622}{(H8804)} their shining{H5051}:"
Joel,2,11,And the LORD{H3068} shall utter{H5414}{(H8804)} his voice{H6963} before{H6440} his army{H2428}: for his camp{H4264} is very{H3966} great{H7227}: for he is strong{H6099} that executeth{H6213}{(H8802)} his word{H1697}: for the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is great{H1419} and very{H3966} terrible{H3372}{(H8737)}; and who can abide{H3557}{(H8686)} it?
Joel,2,12,"Therefore also now, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, turn{H7725}{(H8798)} ye even to me with all your heart{H3824}, and with fasting{H6685}, and with weeping{H1065}, and with mourning{H4553}:"
Joel,2,13,"And rend{H7167}{(H8798)} your heart{H3824}, and not your garments{H899}, and turn{H7725}{(H8798)} unto the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}: for he is gracious{H2587} and merciful{H7349}, slow{H750} to anger{H639}, and of great{H7227} kindness{H2617}, and repenteth{H5162}{(H8737)} him of the evil{H7451}."
Joel,2,14,"Who knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} if he will return{H7725}{(H8799)} and repent{H5162}{(H8738)}, and leave{H7604}{(H8689)} a blessing{H1293} behind{H310} him; even a meat offering{H4503} and a drink offering{H5262} unto the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}?"
Joel,2,15,"Blow{H8628}{(H8798)} the trumpet{H7782} in Zion{H6726}, sanctify{H6942}{(H8761)} a fast{H6685}, call{H7121}{(H8798)} a solemn assembly{H6116}:"
Joel,2,16,"Gather{H622}{(H8798)} the people{H5971}, sanctify{H6942}{(H8761)} the congregation{H6951}, assemble{H6908}{(H8798)} the elders{H2205}, gather{H622}{(H8798)} the children{H5768}, and those that suck{H3243}{(H8802)} the breasts{H7699}: let the bridegroom{H2860} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} of his chamber{H2315}, and the bride{H3618} out of her closet{H2646}."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests{H3548}, the ministers{H8334}{(H8764)} of the LORD{H3068}, weep{H1058}{(H8799)} between the porch{H197} and the altar{H4196}, and let them say{H559}{(H8799)}, Spare{H2347}{(H8798)} thy people{H5971}, O LORD{H3068}, and give{H5414}{(H8799)} not thine heritage{H5159} to reproach{H2781}, that the heathen{H1471} should rule over{H4910}{(H8800)} them: wherefore should they say{H559}{(H8799)} among the people{H5971}, Where is their God{H430}?"
Joel,2,18,"Then will the LORD{H3068} be jealous{H7065}{(H8762)} for his land{H776}, and pity{H2550}{(H8799)} his people{H5971}."
Joel,2,19,"Yea, the LORD{H3068} will answer{H6030}{(H8799)} and say{H559}{(H8799)} unto his people{H5971}, Behold, I will send{H7971}{(H8802)} you corn{H1715}, and wine{H8492}, and oil{H3323}, and ye shall be satisfied{H7646}{(H8804)} therewith: and I will no more make{H5414}{(H8799)} you a reproach{H2781} among the heathen{H1471}:"
Joel,2,20,"But I will remove far off{H7368}{(H8686)} from you the northern{H6830} army, and will drive{H5080}{(H8689)} him into a land{H776} barren{H6723} and desolate{H8077}, with his face{H6440} toward the east{H6931} sea{H3220}, and his hinder part{H5490} toward the utmost{H314} sea{H3220}, and his stink{H889} shall come up{H5927}{(H8804)}, and his ill savour{H6709} shall come up{H5927}{(H8799)}, because he hath done{H6213}{(H8800)} great things{H1431}{(H8689)}."
Joel,2,21,"Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not, O land{H127}; be glad{H1523}{(H8798)} and rejoice{H8055}{(H8798)}: for the LORD{H3068} will do{H6213}{(H8800)} great things{H1431}{(H8689)}."
Joel,2,22,"Be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, ye beasts{H929} of the field{H7704}: for the pastures{H4999} of the wilderness{H4057} do spring{H1876}{(H8804)}, for the tree{H6086} beareth{H5375}{(H8804)} her fruit{H6529}, the fig tree{H8384} and the vine{H1612} do yield{H5414}{(H8804)} their strength{H2428}."
Joel,2,23,"Be glad{H1523}{(H8798)} then, ye children{H1121} of Zion{H6726}, and rejoice{H8055}{(H8798)} in the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}: for he hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} you the former rain{H4175} moderately{H6666}, and he will cause to come down{H3381}{(H8686)} for you the rain{H1653}, the former rain{H4175}, and the latter rain{H4456} in the first{H7223} month."
Joel,2,24,"And the floors{H1637} shall be full{H4390}{(H8804)} of wheat{H1250}, and the fats{H3342} shall overflow{H7783}{(H8689)} with wine{H8492} and oil{H3323}."
Joel,2,25,"And I will restore{H7999}{(H8765)} to you the years{H8141} that the locust{H697} hath eaten{H398}{(H8804)}, the cankerworm{H3218}, and the caterpiller{H2625}, and the palmerworm{H1501}, my great{H1419} army{H2428} which I sent{H7971}{(H8765)} among you."
Joel,2,26,"And ye shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} in plenty{H398}{(H8800)}, and be satisfied{H7646}{(H8800)}, and praise{H1984}{(H8765)} the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, that hath dealt{H6213}{(H8804)} wondrously{H6381}{(H8687)} with you: and my people{H5971} shall never{H5769} be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)}."
Joel,2,27,"And ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am in the midst{H7130} of Israel{H3478}, and that I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, and none else: and my people{H5971} shall never{H5769} be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)}."
Joel,2,28,"And it shall come to pass afterward{H310}, that I will pour out{H8210}{(H8799)} my spirit{H7307} upon all flesh{H1320}; and your sons{H1121} and your daughters{H1323} shall prophesy{H5012}{(H8738)}, your old men{H2205} shall dream{H2492}{(H8799)} dreams{H2472}, your young men{H970} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} visions{H2384}:"
Joel,2,29,And also upon the servants{H5650} and upon the handmaids{H8198} in those days{H3117} will I pour out{H8210}{(H8799)} my spirit{H7307}.
Joel,2,30,"And I will shew{H5414}{(H8804)} wonders{H4159} in the heavens{H8064} and in the earth{H776}, blood{H1818}, and fire{H784}, and pillars{H8490} of smoke{H6227}."
Joel,2,31,"The sun{H8121} shall be turned{H2015}{(H8735)} into darkness{H2822}, and the moon{H3394} into blood{H1818}, before{H6440} the great{H1419} and the terrible{H3372}{(H8737)} day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} come{H935}{(H8800)}."
Joel,2,32,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call{H7121}{(H8799)} on the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} shall be delivered{H4422}{(H8735)}: for in mount{H2022} Zion{H6726} and in Jerusalem{H3389} shall be deliverance{H6413}, as the LORD{H3068} hath said{H559}{(H8804)}, and in the remnant{H8300} whom the LORD{H3068} shall call{H7121}{(H8802)}."
Joel,3,1,"For, behold, in those days{H3117}, and in that time{H6256}, when I shall bring again{H7725}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H7725}{(H8799)} the captivity{H7622} of Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389},"
Joel,3,2,"I will also gather{H6908}{(H8765)} all nations{H1471}, and will bring them down{H3381}{(H8689)} into the valley{H6010} of Jehoshaphat{H3092}, and will plead{H8199}{(H8738)} with them there for my people{H5971} and for my heritage{H5159} Israel{H3478}, whom they have scattered{H6340}{(H8765)} among the nations{H1471}, and parted{H2505}{(H8765)} my land{H776}."
Joel,3,3,"And they have cast{H3032}{(H8804)} lots{H1486} for my people{H5971}; and have given{H5414}{(H8799)} a boy{H3206} for an harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, and sold{H4376}{(H8804)} a girl{H3207} for wine{H3196}, that they might drink{H8354}{(H8799)}."
Joel,3,4,"Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre{H6865}, and Zidon{H6721}, and all the coasts{H1552} of Palestine{H6429}? will ye render{H7999}{(H8764)} me a recompence{H1576}? and if ye recompense{H1580}{(H8802)} me, swiftly{H7031} and speedily{H4120} will I return{H7725}{(H8686)} your recompence{H1576} upon your own head{H7218};"
Joel,3,5,"Because ye have taken{H3947}{(H8804)} my silver{H3701} and my gold{H2091}, and have carried{H935}{(H8689)} into your temples{H1964} my goodly{H2896} pleasant things{H4261}:"
Joel,3,6,"The children{H1121} also of Judah{H3063} and the children{H1121} of Jerusalem{H3389} have ye sold{H4376}{(H8804)} unto the Grecians{H3125}{H1121}, that ye might remove them far{H7368}{(H8687)} from their border{H1366}."
Joel,3,7,"Behold, I will raise{H5782}{(H8688)} them out of the place{H4725} whither ye have sold{H4376}{(H8804)} them, and will return{H7725}{(H8689)} your recompence{H1576} upon your own head{H7218}:"
Joel,3,8,"And I will sell{H4376}{(H8804)} your sons{H1121} and your daughters{H1323} into the hand{H3027} of the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063}, and they shall sell{H4376}{(H8804)} them to the Sabeans{H7615}, to a people{H1471} far off{H7350}: for the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Joel,3,9,"Proclaim{H7121}{(H8798)} ye this among the Gentiles{H1471}; Prepare{H6942}{(H8761)} war{H4421}, wake up{H5782}{(H8685)} the mighty men{H1368}, let all the men{H582} of war{H4421} draw near{H5066}{(H8799)}; let them come up{H5927}{(H8799)}:"
Joel,3,10,"Beat{H3807}{(H8798)} your plowshares{H855} into swords{H2719}, and your pruninghooks{H4211} into spears{H7420}: let the weak{H2523} say{H559}{(H8799)}, I am strong{H1368}."
Joel,3,11,"Assemble{H5789}{(H8798)} yourselves, and come{H935}{(H8798)}, all ye heathen{H1471}, and gather yourselves together{H6908}{(H8738)} round about{H5439}: thither cause thy mighty ones{H1368} to come down{H5181}{(H8685)}, O LORD{H3068}."
Joel,3,12,"Let the heathen{H1471} be wakened{H5782}{(H8735)}, and come up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the valley{H6010} of Jehoshaphat{H3092}: for there will I sit{H3427}{(H8799)} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} all the heathen{H1471} round about{H5439}."
Joel,3,13,"Put{H7971}{(H8798)} ye in the sickle{H4038}, for the harvest{H7105} is ripe{H1310}{(H8804)}: come{H935}{(H8798)}, get you down{H3381}{(H8798)}; for the press{H1660} is full{H4390}{(H8804)}, the fats{H3342} overflow{H7783}{(H8689)}; for their wickedness{H7451} is great{H7227}."
Joel,3,14,"Multitudes{H1995}, multitudes{H1995} in the valley{H6010} of decision{H2742}: for the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is near{H7138} in the valley{H6010} of decision{H2742}."
Joel,3,15,"The sun{H8121} and the moon{H3394} shall be darkened{H6937}{(H8804)}, and the stars{H3556} shall withdraw{H622}{(H8804)} their shining{H5051}."

Amos,4,9,"I have smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} you with blasting{H7711} and mildew{H3420}: when your gardens{H1593} and your vineyards{H3754} and your fig trees{H8384} and your olive trees{H2132} increased{H7235}{(H8687)}, the palmerworm{H1501} devoured{H398}{(H8799)} them: yet have ye not returned{H7725}{(H8804)} unto me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,4,10,"I have sent{H7971}{(H8765)} among you the pestilence{H1698} after the manner{H1870} of Egypt{H4714}: your young men{H970} have I slain{H2026}{(H8804)} with the sword{H2719}, and have taken away{H7628} your horses{H5483}; and I have made the stink{H889} of your camps{H4264} to come up{H5927}{(H8686)} unto your nostrils{H639}: yet have ye not returned{H7725}{(H8804)} unto me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,4,11,"I have overthrown{H2015}{(H8804)} some of you, as God{H430} overthrew{H4114} Sodom{H5467} and Gomorrah{H6017}, and ye were as a firebrand{H181} plucked out{H5337}{(H8716)} of the burning{H8316}: yet have ye not returned{H7725}{(H8804)} unto me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,4,12,"Therefore thus will I do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto thee, O Israel{H3478}: and because{H6118} I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} this unto thee, prepare{H3559}{(H8734)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} thy God{H430}, O Israel{H3478}."
Amos,4,13,"For, lo, he that formeth{H3335}{(H8802)} the mountains{H2022}, and createth{H1254}{(H8802)} the wind{H7307}, and declareth{H5046}{(H8688)} unto man{H120} what is his thought{H7808}, that maketh{H6213}{(H8802)} the morning{H7837} darkness{H5890}, and treadeth{H1869}{(H8802)} upon the high places{H1116} of the earth{H776}, The LORD{H3068}, The God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, is his name{H8034}."
Amos,5,1,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye this word{H1697} which I take up{H5375}{(H8802)} against you, even a lamentation{H7015}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Amos,5,2,The virgin{H1330} of Israel{H3478} is fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}; she shall no more{H3254}{(H8686)} rise{H6965}{(H8800)}: she is forsaken{H5203}{(H8738)} upon her land{H127}; there is none to raise her up{H6965}{(H8688)}.
Amos,5,3,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; The city{H5892} that went out{H3318}{(H8802)} by a thousand{H505} shall leave{H7604}{(H8686)} an hundred{H3967}, and that which went forth{H3318}{(H8802)} by an hundred{H3967} shall leave{H7604}{(H8686)} ten{H6235}, to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Amos,5,4,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, Seek{H1875}{(H8798)} ye me, and ye shall live{H2421}{(H8798)}:"
Amos,5,5,"But seek{H1875}{(H8799)} not Bethel{H1008}, nor enter{H935}{(H8799)} into Gilgal{H1537}, and pass{H5674}{(H8799)} not to Beersheba{H884}: for Gilgal{H1537} shall surely{H1540}{(H8800)} go into captivity{H1540}{(H8799)}, and Bethel{H1008} shall come to nought{H205}."
Amos,5,6,"Seek{H1875}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068}, and ye shall live{H2421}{(H8798)}; lest he break out{H6743}{(H8799)} like fire{H784} in the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130}, and devour{H398}{(H8804)} it, and there be none to quench{H3518}{(H8764)} it in Bethel{H1008}."
Amos,5,7,"Ye who turn{H2015}{(H8802)} judgment{H4941} to wormwood{H3939}, and leave off{H3240}{(H8689)} righteousness{H6666} in the earth{H776},"
Amos,5,8,"Seek him that maketh{H6213}{(H8802)} the seven stars{H3598} and Orion{H3685}, and turneth{H2015}{(H8802)} the shadow of death{H6757} into the morning{H1242}, and maketh the day{H3117} dark{H2821}{(H8689)} with night{H3915}: that calleth{H7121}{(H8802)} for the waters{H4325} of the sea{H3220}, and poureth them out{H8210}{(H8799)} upon the face{H6440} of the earth{H776}: The LORD{H3068} is his name{H8034}:"
Amos,5,9,"That strengtheneth{H1082}{(H8688)} the spoiled{H7701} against the strong{H5794}, so that the spoiled{H7701} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} against the fortress{H4013}."
Amos,5,10,"They hate{H8130}{(H8804)} him that rebuketh{H3198}{(H8688)} in the gate{H8179}, and they abhor{H8581}{(H8762)} him that speaketh{H1696}{(H8802)} uprightly{H8549}."
Amos,5,11,"Forasmuch{H3282} therefore as your treading{H1318}{(H8780)} is upon the poor{H1800}, and ye take{H3947}{(H8799)} from him burdens{H4864} of wheat{H1250}: ye have built{H1129}{(H8804)} houses{H1004} of hewn stone{H1496}, but ye shall not dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in them; ye have planted{H5193}{(H8804)} pleasant{H2531} vineyards{H3754}, but ye shall not drink{H8354}{(H8799)} wine{H3196} of them."
Amos,5,12,"For I know{H3045}{(H8804)} your manifold{H7227} transgressions{H6588} and your mighty{H6099} sins{H2403}: they afflict{H6887}{(H8802)} the just{H6662}, they take{H3947}{(H8802)} a bribe{H3724}, and they turn aside{H5186}{(H8689)} the poor{H34} in the gate{H8179} from their right."
Amos,5,13,Therefore the prudent{H7919}{(H8688)} shall keep silence{H1826}{(H8799)} in that time{H6256}; for it is an evil{H7451} time{H6256}.
Amos,5,14,"Seek{H1875}{(H8798)} good{H2896}, and not evil{H7451}, that ye may live{H2421}{(H8799)}: and so the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, shall be with you, as ye have spoken{H559}{(H8804)}."
Amos,5,15,"Hate{H8130}{(H8798)} the evil{H7451}, and love{H157}{(H8798)} the good{H2896}, and establish{H3322}{(H8685)} judgment{H4941} in the gate{H8179}: it may be that the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635} will be gracious{H2603}{(H8799)} unto the remnant{H7611} of Joseph{H3130}."
Amos,5,16,"Therefore the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, the Lord{H136}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} thus; Wailing{H4553} shall be in all streets{H7339}; and they shall say{H559}{(H8799)} in all the highways{H2351}, Alas{H1930}! alas{H1930}! and they shall call{H7121}{(H8804)} the husbandman{H406} to mourning{H60}, and such as are skilful{H3045}{(H8802)} of lamentation{H5092} to wailing{H4553}."
Amos,5,17,"And in all vineyards{H3754} shall be wailing{H4553}: for I will pass{H5674}{(H8799)} through{H7130} thee, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,5,18,"Woe{H1945} unto you that desire{H183}{(H8693)} the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068}! to what end{H4100} is it for you? the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is darkness{H2822}, and not light{H216}."
Amos,5,19,"As if a man{H376} did flee{H5127}{(H8799)} from{H6440} a lion{H738}, and a bear{H1677} met{H6293}{(H8804)} him; or went{H935}{(H8804)} into the house{H1004}, and leaned{H5564}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027} on the wall{H7023}, and a serpent{H5175} bit{H5391}{(H8804)} him."
Amos,5,20,"Shall not the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} be darkness{H2822}, and not light{H216}? even very dark{H651}, and no brightness{H5051} in it?"
Amos,5,21,"I hate{H8130}{(H8804)}, I despise{H3988}{(H8804)} your feast days{H2282}, and I will not smell{H7306}{(H8686)} in your solemn assemblies{H6116}."
Amos,5,22,"Though ye offer{H5927}{(H8686)} me burnt offerings{H5930} and your meat offerings{H4503}, I will not accept{H7521}{(H8799)} them: neither will I regard{H5027}{(H8686)} the peace offerings{H8002} of your fat beasts{H4806}."
Amos,5,23,Take thou away{H5493}{(H8685)} from me the noise{H1995} of thy songs{H7892}; for I will not hear{H8085}{(H8799)} the melody{H2172} of thy viols{H5035}.
Amos,5,24,"But let judgment{H4941} run down{H1556}{(H8735)} as waters{H4325}, and righteousness{H6666} as a mighty{H386} stream{H5158}."
Amos,5,25,"Have ye offered{H5066}{(H8689)} unto me sacrifices{H2077} and offerings{H4503} in the wilderness{H4057} forty{H705} years{H8141}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}?"
Amos,5,26,"But ye have borne{H5375}{(H8804)} the tabernacle{H5522} of your Moloch{H4428} and Chiun{H3594} your images{H6754}, the star{H3556} of your god{H430}, which ye made{H6213}{(H8804)} to yourselves."
Amos,5,27,"Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity{H1540}{(H8689)} beyond{H1973} Damascus{H1834}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, whose name{H8034} is The God{H430} of hosts{H6635}."
Amos,6,1,"Woe{H1945} to them that are at ease{H7600} in Zion{H6726}, and trust{H982}{(H8802)} in the mountain{H2022} of Samaria{H8111}, which are named{H5344}{(H8803)} chief{H7225} of the nations{H1471}, to whom the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8804)}!"
Amos,6,2,"Pass{H5674}{(H8798)} ye unto Calneh{H3641}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)}; and from thence go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye to Hamath{H2574} the great{H7227}{(H8677)}{H2579}: then go down{H3381}{(H8798)} to Gath{H1661} of the Philistines{H6430}: be they better{H2896} than these kingdoms{H4467}? or their border{H1366} greater{H7227} than your border{H1366}?"
Amos,6,3,"Ye that put far away{H5077}{(H8764)} the evil{H7451} day{H3117}, and cause the seat{H7675}{(H8800)} of violence{H2555} to come near{H5066}{(H8686)};"
Amos,6,4,"That lie{H7901}{(H8802)} upon beds{H4296} of ivory{H8127}, and stretch{H5628}{(H8803)} themselves upon their couches{H6210}, and eat{H398}{(H8802)} the lambs{H3733} out of the flock{H6629}, and the calves{H5695} out of the midst{H8432} of the stall{H4770};"
Amos,6,5,"That chant{H6527}{(H8802)} to the sound{H6310} of the viol{H5035}, and invent{H2803}{(H8804)} to themselves instruments{H3627} of musick{H7892}, like David{H1732};"
Amos,6,6,"That drink{H8354}{(H8802)} wine{H3196} in bowls{H4219}, and anoint{H4886}{(H8799)} themselves with the chief{H7225} ointments{H8081}: but they are not grieved{H2470}{(H8738)} for the affliction{H7667} of Joseph{H3130}."
Amos,6,7,"Therefore now shall they go captive{H1540}{(H8799)} with the first{H7218} that go captive{H1540}{(H8802)}, and the banquet{H4797} of them that stretched{H5628}{(H8803)} themselves shall be removed{H5493}{(H8804)}."
Amos,6,8,"The Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} hath sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} by himself{H5315}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} the God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, I abhor{H8374}{(H8764)} the excellency{H1347} of Jacob{H3290}, and hate{H8130}{(H8804)} his palaces{H759}: therefore will I deliver up{H5462}{(H8689)} the city{H5892} with all that is therein{H4393}."
Amos,6,9,"And it shall come to pass, if there remain{H3498}{(H8735)} ten{H6235} men{H582} in one{H259} house{H1004}, that they shall die{H4191}{(H8804)}."
Amos,6,10,"And a man's uncle{H1730} shall take him up{H5375}{(H8804)}, and he that burneth{H5635}{(H8764)} him, to bring out{H3318}{(H8687)} the bones{H6106} out of the house{H1004}, and shall say{H559}{(H8804)} unto him that is by the sides{H3411} of the house{H1004}, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say{H559}{(H8804)}, No{H657}. Then shall he say{H559}{(H8804)}, Hold thy tongue{H2013}{(H8761)}: for we may not make mention{H2142}{(H8687)} of the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,6,11,"For, behold, the LORD{H3068} commandeth{H6680}{(H8764)}, and he will smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the great{H1419} house{H1004} with breaches{H7447}, and the little{H6996} house{H1004} with clefts{H1233}."
Amos,6,12,"Shall horses{H5483} run{H7323}{(H8799)} upon the rock{H5553}? will one plow{H2790}{(H8799)} there with oxen{H1241}? for ye have turned{H2015}{(H8804)} judgment{H4941} into gall{H7219}, and the fruit{H6529} of righteousness{H6666} into hemlock{H3939}:"
Amos,6,13,"Ye which rejoice{H8056} in a thing{H1697} of nought{H3808}, which say{H559}{(H8802)}, Have we not taken{H3947}{(H8804)} to us horns{H7161} by our own strength{H2392}?"
Amos,6,14,"But, behold, I will raise up{H6965}{(H8688)} against you a nation{H1471}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} the God{H430} of hosts{H6635}; and they shall afflict{H3905}{(H8804)} you from the entering in{H935}{(H8800)} of Hemath{H2574} unto the river{H5158} of the wilderness{H6160}."
Amos,7,1,"Thus hath the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} unto me; and, behold, he formed{H3335}{(H8802)} grasshoppers{H1462} in the beginning{H8462} of the shooting up{H5927}{(H8800)} of the latter growth{H3954}; and, lo, it was the latter growth{H3954} after{H310} the king's{H4428} mowings{H1488}."
Amos,7,2,"And it came to pass, that when they had made an end{H3615}{(H8765)} of eating{H398}{(H8800)} the grass{H6212} of the land{H776}, then I said{H559}{(H8799)}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, forgive{H5545}{(H8798)}, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob{H3290} arise{H6965}{(H8799)}? for he is small{H6996}."
Amos,7,3,"The LORD{H3068} repented{H5162}{(H8738)} for this: It shall not be, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,7,4,"Thus hath the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} unto me: and, behold, the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} called{H7121}{(H8802)} to contend{H7378}{(H8800)} by fire{H784}, and it devoured{H398}{(H8799)} the great{H7227} deep{H8415}, and did eat up{H398}{(H8804)} a part{H2506}."
Amos,7,5,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, cease{H2308}{(H8798)}, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob{H3290} arise{H6965}{(H8799)}? for he is small{H6996}."
Amos,7,6,"The LORD{H3068} repented{H5162}{(H8738)} for this: This also shall not be, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Amos,7,7,"Thus he shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} me: and, behold, the Lord{H136} stood{H5324}{(H8737)} upon a wall{H2346} made by a plumbline{H594}, with a plumbline{H594} in his hand{H3027}."
Amos,7,8,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Amos{H5986}, what seest{H7200}{(H8802)} thou? And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, A plumbline{H594}. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the Lord{H136}, Behold, I will set{H7760}{(H8802)} a plumbline{H594} in the midst{H7130} of my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}: I will not again{H3254}{(H8686)} pass by{H5674}{(H8800)} them any more:"
Amos,7,9,"And the high places{H1116} of Isaac{H3446} shall be desolate{H8074}{(H8738)}, and the sanctuaries{H4720} of Israel{H3478} shall be laid waste{H2717}{(H8799)}; and I will rise{H6965}{(H8804)} against the house{H1004} of Jeroboam{H3379} with the sword{H2719}."
Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah{H558} the priest{H3548} of Bethel{H1008} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} to Jeroboam{H3379} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Amos{H5986} hath conspired{H7194}{(H8804)} against thee in the midst{H7130} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}: the land{H776} is not able{H3201}{(H8799)} to bear{H3557}{(H8687)} all his words{H1697}."
Amos,7,11,"For thus Amos{H5986} saith{H559}{(H8804)}, Jeroboam{H3379} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, and Israel{H3478} shall surely{H1540}{(H8800)} be led away captive{H1540}{(H8799)} out of their own land{H127}."
Amos,7,12,"Also Amaziah{H558} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Amos{H5986}, O thou seer{H2374}, go{H3212}{(H8798)}, flee thee away{H1272}{(H8798)} into the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}, and there eat{H398}{(H8798)} bread{H3899}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8735)} there:"
Amos,7,13,"But prophesy{H5012}{(H8736)} not again{H3254}{(H8686)} any more at Bethel{H1008}: for it is the king's{H4428} chapel{H4720}, and it is the king's{H4467} court{H1004}."
Amos,7,14,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Amos{H5986}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} to Amaziah{H558}, I was no prophet{H5030}, neither was I a prophet's{H5030} son{H1121}; but I was an herdman{H951}, and a gatherer{H1103}{(H8802)} of sycomore fruit{H8256}:"
Amos,7,15,"And the LORD{H3068} took{H3947}{(H8799)} me as I followed{H310} the flock{H6629}, and the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} unto my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}."
Amos,7,16,"Now therefore hear{H8085}{(H8798)} thou the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}: Thou sayest{H559}{(H8802)}, Prophesy{H5012}{(H8735)} not against Israel{H3478}, and drop{H5197}{(H8686)} not thy word against the house{H1004} of Isaac{H3446}."
Amos,7,17,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Thy wife{H802} shall be an harlot{H2181}{(H8799)} in the city{H5892}, and thy sons{H1121} and thy daughters{H1323} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, and thy land{H127} shall be divided{H2505}{(H8792)} by line{H2256}; and thou shalt die{H4191}{(H8799)} in{H5921} a polluted{H2931} land{H127}: and Israel{H3478} shall surely{H1540}{(H8800)} go into captivity{H1540}{(H8799)} forth of his land{H127}."
Amos,8,1,Thus hath the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} unto me: and behold a basket{H3619} of summer fruit{H7019}.
Amos,8,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Amos{H5986}, what seest{H7200}{(H8802)} thou? And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, A basket{H3619} of summer fruit{H7019}. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} unto me, The end{H7093} is come{H935}{(H8804)} upon my people{H5971} of Israel{H3478}; I will not again{H3254}{(H8686)} pass{H5674}{(H8800)} by them any more."
Amos,8,3,"And the songs{H7892} of the temple{H1964} shall be howlings{H3213}{(H8689)} in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}: there shall be many{H7227} dead bodies{H6297} in every place{H4725}; they shall cast them forth{H7993}{(H8689)} with silence{H2013}{(H8761)}."
Amos,8,4,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} this, O ye that swallow up{H7602}{(H8802)} the needy{H34}, even to make{H7673} the poor{H6041}{(H8675)}{H6035} of the land{H776} to fail{H7673}{(H8687)},"
Amos,8,5,"Saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When will the new moon{H2320} be gone{H5674}{(H8799)}, that we may sell{H7666}{(H8686)} corn{H7668}? and the sabbath{H7676}, that we may set forth{H6605}{(H8799)} wheat{H1250}, making the ephah{H374} small{H6994}{(H8687)}, and the shekel{H8255} great{H1431}{(H8687)}, and falsifying{H5791}{(H8763)} the balances{H3976} by deceit{H4820}?"
Amos,8,6,"That we may buy{H7069}{(H8800)} the poor{H1800} for silver{H3701}, and the needy{H34} for a pair of shoes{H5275}; yea, and sell{H7666}{(H8686)} the refuse{H4651} of the wheat{H1250}?"
Amos,8,7,"The LORD{H3068} hath sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} by the excellency{H1347} of Jacob{H3290}, Surely I will never{H5331} forget{H7911}{(H8799)} any of their works{H4639}."
Amos,8,8,"Shall not the land{H776} tremble{H7264}{(H8799)} for this, and every one mourn{H56}{(H8804)} that dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} therein? and it shall rise up{H5927}{(H8804)} wholly as a flood{H2975}; and it shall be cast out{H1644}{(H8738)} and drowned{H8257}{(H8738)}{(H8675)}{H8248}{(H8738)}, as by the flood{H216} of Egypt{H4714}."
Amos,8,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, that I will cause the sun{H8121} to go down{H935}{(H8689)} at noon{H6672}, and I will darken{H2821}{(H8689)} the earth{H776} in the clear{H216} day{H3117}:"
Amos,8,10,"And I will turn{H2015}{(H8804)} your feasts{H2282} into mourning{H60}, and all your songs{H7892} into lamentation{H7015}; and I will bring up{H5927}{(H8689)} sackcloth{H8242} upon all loins{H4975}, and baldness{H7144} upon every head{H7218}; and I will make{H7760}{(H8804)} it as the mourning{H60} of an only{H3173} son, and the end{H319} thereof as a bitter{H4751} day{H3117}."
Amos,8,11,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, that I will send{H7971}{(H8689)} a famine{H7458} in the land{H776}, not a famine{H7458} of bread{H3899}, nor a thirst{H6772} for water{H4325}, but of hearing{H8085}{(H8800)} the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Amos,8,12,"And they shall wander{H5128}{(H8804)} from sea{H3220} to sea{H3220}, and from the north{H6828} even to the east{H4217}, they shall run to and fro{H7751}{(H8787)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} it."
Amos,8,13,In that day{H3117} shall the fair{H3303} virgins{H1330} and young men{H970} faint{H5968}{(H8691)} for thirst{H6772}.
Amos,8,14,"They that swear{H7650}{(H8737)} by the sin{H819} of Samaria{H8111}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thy god{H430}, O Dan{H1835}, liveth{H2416}; and, The manner{H1870} of Beersheba{H884} liveth{H2416}; even they shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)}, and never rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} again."
Amos,9,1,"I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} standing{H5324}{(H8737)} upon the altar{H4196}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} the lintel of the door{H3730}, that the posts{H5592} may shake{H7493}{(H8799)}: and cut{H1214}{(H8798)} them in the head{H7218}, all of them; and I will slay{H2026}{(H8799)} the last{H319} of them with the sword{H2719}: he that fleeth{H5127}{(H8801)} of them shall not flee away{H5127}{(H8799)}, and he that escapeth{H6412} of them shall not be delivered{H4422}{(H8735)}."
Amos,9,2,"Though they dig{H2864}{(H8799)} into hell{H7585}, thence shall mine hand{H3027} take{H3947}{(H8799)} them; though they climb up{H5927}{(H8799)} to heaven{H8064}, thence will I bring them down{H3381}{(H8686)}:"
Amos,9,3,"And though they hide{H2244}{(H8735)} themselves in the top{H7218} of Carmel{H3760}, I will search{H2664}{(H8762)} and take them out{H3947}{(H8804)} thence; and though they be hid{H5641}{(H8735)} from my sight{H5869} in the bottom{H7172} of the sea{H3220}, thence will I command{H6680}{(H8762)} the serpent{H5175}, and he shall bite{H5391}{(H8804)} them:"
Amos,9,4,"And though they go{H3212}{(H8799)} into captivity{H7628} before{H6440} their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, thence will I command{H6680}{(H8762)} the sword{H2719}, and it shall slay{H2026}{(H8804)} them: and I will set{H7760}{(H8804)} mine eyes{H5869} upon them for evil{H7451}, and not for good{H2896}."
Amos,9,5,"And the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} of hosts{H6635} is he that toucheth{H5060}{(H8802)} the land{H776}, and it shall melt{H4127}{(H8799)}, and all that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein shall mourn{H56}{(H8804)}: and it shall rise up{H5927}{(H8804)} wholly like a flood{H2975}; and shall be drowned{H8257}{(H8804)}, as by the flood{H2975} of Egypt{H4714}."
Amos,9,6,"It is he that buildeth{H1129}{(H8802)} his stories{H4609} in the heaven{H8064}, and hath founded{H3245}{(H8804)} his troop{H92} in the earth{H776}; he that calleth{H7121}{(H8802)} for the waters{H4325} of the sea{H3220}, and poureth them out{H8210}{(H8799)} upon the face{H6440} of the earth{H776}: The LORD{H3068} is his name{H8034}."
Amos,9,7,"Are ye not as children{H1121} of the Ethiopians{H3569} unto me, O children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}. Have not I brought up{H5927}{(H8689)} Israel{H3478} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}? and the Philistines{H6430} from Caphtor{H3731}, and the Syrians{H758} from Kir{H7024}?"
Amos,9,8,"Behold, the eyes{H5869} of the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} are upon the sinful{H2403} kingdom{H4467}, and I will destroy{H8045}{(H8689)} it from off the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}; saving{H657} that I will not utterly{H8045}{(H8687)} destroy{H8045}{(H8686)} the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Amos,9,9,"For, lo, I will command{H6680}{(H8764)}, and I will sift{H5128}{(H8689)} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} among all nations{H1471}, like as corn is sifted{H5128}{(H8735)} in a sieve{H3531}, yet shall not the least grain{H6872} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the earth{H776}."
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners{H2400} of my people{H5971} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, which say{H559}{(H8802)}, The evil{H7451} shall not overtake{H5066}{(H8686)} nor prevent{H6923}{(H8686)} us."
Amos,9,11,"In that day{H3117} will I raise up{H6965}{(H8686)} the tabernacle{H5521} of David{H1732} that is fallen{H5307}{(H8802)}, and close up{H1443}{(H8804)} the breaches{H6556} thereof; and I will raise up{H6965}{(H8686)} his ruins{H2034}, and I will build{H1129}{(H8804)} it as in the days{H3117} of old{H5769}:"
Amos,9,12,"That they may possess{H3423}{(H8799)} the remnant{H7611} of Edom{H123}, and of all the heathen{H1471}, which are called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} that doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} this."
Amos,9,13,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that the plowman{H2790}{(H8802)} shall overtake{H5066}{(H8738)} the reaper{H7114}{(H8802)}, and the treader{H1869}{(H8802)} of grapes{H6025} him that soweth{H4900}{(H8802)} seed{H2233}; and the mountains{H2022} shall drop{H5197}{(H8689)} sweet wine{H6071}, and all the hills{H1389} shall melt{H4127}{(H8709)}."
Amos,9,14,"And I will bring again{H7725}{(H8804)} the captivity{H7622} of my people{H5971} of Israel{H3478}, and they shall build{H1129}{(H8804)} the waste{H8074}{(H8737)} cities{H5892}, and inhabit{H3427}{(H8804)} them; and they shall plant{H5193}{(H8804)} vineyards{H3754}, and drink{H8354}{(H8804)} the wine{H3196} thereof; they shall also make{H6213}{(H8804)} gardens{H1593}, and eat{H398}{(H8804)} the fruit{H6529} of them."
Amos,9,15,"And I will plant{H5193}{(H8804)} them upon their land{H127}, and they shall no more be pulled up{H5428}{(H8735)} out of their land{H127} which I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} them, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}."
Obadiah,1,1,"The vision{H2377} of Obadiah{H5662}. Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} concerning Edom{H123}; We have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} a rumour{H8052} from the LORD{H3068}, and an ambassador{H6735} is sent{H7971}{(H8795)} among the heathen{H1471}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} ye, and let us rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} against her in battle{H4421}."
Obadiah,1,2,"Behold, I have made{H5414}{(H8804)} thee small{H6996} among the heathen{H1471}: thou art greatly{H3966} despised{H959}{(H8803)}."
Obadiah,1,3,"The pride{H2087} of thine heart{H3820} hath deceived{H5377}{(H8689)} thee, thou that dwellest{H7931}{(H8802)} in the clefts{H2288} of the rock{H5553}, whose habitation{H3427}{(H8800)} is high{H4791}; that saith{H559}{(H8802)} in his heart{H3820}, Who shall bring me down{H3381}{(H8686)} to the ground{H776}?"
Obadiah,1,4,"Though thou exalt{H1361}{(H8686)} thyself as the eagle{H5404}, and though thou set{H7760}{(H8800)} thy nest{H7064} among the stars{H3556}, thence will I bring thee down{H3381}{(H8686)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves{H1590} came{H935}{(H8804)} to thee, if robbers{H7703}{(H8802)} by night{H3915},(how{H349} art thou cut off{H1820}{(H8738)}!) would they not have stolen{H1589}{(H8799)} till they had enough{H1767}? if the grapegatherers{H1219}{(H8802)} came{H935}{(H8804)} to thee, would they not leave{H7604}{(H8686)} some grapes{H5955}?"
Obadiah,1,6,How are the things of Esau{H6215} searched out{H2664}{(H8738)}! how are his hidden{H4710} things sought up{H1158}{(H8738)}!
Obadiah,1,7,"All the men{H582} of thy confederacy{H1285} have brought{H7971}{(H8765)} thee even to the border{H1366}: the men{H582} that were at peace{H7965} with thee have deceived{H5377}{(H8689)} thee, and prevailed{H3201}{(H8804)} against thee; they that eat thy bread{H3899} have laid{H7760}{(H8799)} a wound{H4204} under thee: there is none understanding{H8394} in him."
Obadiah,1,8,"Shall I not in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, even destroy{H6}{(H8689)} the wise{H2450} men out of Edom{H123}, and understanding{H8394} out of the mount{H2022} of Esau{H6215}?"
Obadiah,1,9,"And thy mighty{H1368} men, O Teman{H8487}, shall be dismayed{H2865}{(H8804)}, to the end that every one{H376} of the mount{H2022} of Esau{H6215} may be cut off{H3772}{(H8735)} by slaughter{H6993}."
Obadiah,1,10,"For thy violence{H2555} against thy brother{H251} Jacob{H3290} shame{H955} shall cover{H3680}{(H8762)} thee, and thou shalt be cut off{H3772}{(H8738)} for ever{H5769}."
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day{H3117} that thou stoodest{H5975}{(H8800)} on the other side, in the day{H3117} that the strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} carried away captive{H7617}{(H8800)} his forces{H2428}, and foreigners{H5237} entered{H935}{(H8804)} into his gates{H8179}, and cast{H3032}{(H8804)} lots{H1486} upon Jerusalem{H3389}, even thou wast as one{H259} of them."
Obadiah,1,12,But thou shouldest not have looked{H7200}{(H8799)} on the day{H3117} of thy brother{H251} in the day{H3117} that he became a stranger{H5235}; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced{H8055}{(H8799)} over the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} in the day{H3117} of their destruction{H6}{(H8800)}; neither shouldest thou have spoken{H6310} proudly{H1431}{(H8686)} in the day{H3117} of distress{H6869}.
Obadiah,1,13,"Thou shouldest not have entered{H935}{(H8799)} into the gate{H8179} of my people{H5971} in the day{H3117} of their calamity{H343}; yea, thou shouldest not have looked{H7200}{(H8799)} on their affliction{H7451} in the day{H3117} of their calamity{H343}, nor have laid{H7971}{(H8799)} hands on their substance{H2428} in the day{H3117} of their calamity{H343};"
Obadiah,1,14,"Neither shouldest thou have stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the crossway{H6563}, to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} those of his that did escape{H6412}; neither shouldest thou have delivered up{H5462}{(H8686)} those of his that did remain{H8300} in the day{H3117} of distress{H6869}."
Obadiah,1,15,"For the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is near{H7138} upon all the heathen{H1471}: as thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}, it shall be done{H6213}{(H8735)} unto thee: thy reward{H1576} shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} upon thine own head{H7218}."
Obadiah,1,16,"For as ye have drunk{H8354}{(H8804)} upon my holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}, so shall all the heathen{H1471} drink{H8354}{(H8799)} continually{H8548}, yea, they shall drink{H8354}{(H8804)}, and they shall swallow down{H3886}{(H8804)}, and they shall be as though they had not{H3808} been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But upon mount{H2022} Zion{H6726} shall be deliverance{H6413}, and there shall be holiness{H6944}; and the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290} shall possess{H3423}{(H8804)} their possessions{H4180}."
Obadiah,1,18,"And the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290} shall be a fire{H784}, and the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130} a flame{H3852}, and the house{H1004} of Esau{H6215} for stubble{H7179}, and they shall kindle{H1814}{(H8804)} in them, and devour{H398}{(H8804)} them; and there shall not be any remaining{H8300} of the house{H1004} of Esau{H6215}; for the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Obadiah,1,19,"And they of the south{H5045} shall possess{H3423}{(H8804)} the mount{H2022} of Esau{H6215}; and they of the plain{H8219} the Philistines{H6430}: and they shall possess{H3423}{(H8804)} the fields{H7704} of Ephraim{H669}, and the fields{H7704} of Samaria{H8111}: and Benjamin{H1144} shall possess Gilead{H1568}."
Obadiah,1,20,"And the captivity{H1546} of this host{H2426} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} shall possess that of the Canaanites{H3669}, even unto Zarephath{H6886}; and the captivity{H1546} of Jerusalem{H3389}, which is in Sepharad{H5614}, shall possess{H3423}{(H8799)} the cities{H5892} of the south{H5045}."
Obadiah,1,21,And saviours{H3467}{(H8688)} shall come up{H5927}{(H8804)} on mount{H2022} Zion{H6726} to judge{H8199}{(H8800)} the mount{H2022} of Esau{H6215}; and the kingdom{H4410} shall be the LORD'S{H3068}.
Jonah,1,1,"Now the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Jonah{H3124} the son{H1121} of Amittai{H573}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jonah,1,2,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go{H3212}{(H8798)} to Nineveh{H5210}, that great{H1419} city{H5892}, and cry{H7121}{(H8798)} against it; for their wickedness{H7451} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} before{H6440} me."
Jonah,1,3,"But Jonah{H3124} rose up{H6965}{(H8799)} to flee{H1272}{(H8800)} unto Tarshish{H8659} from the presence{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}, and went down{H3381}{(H8799)} to Joppa{H3305}; and he found{H4672}{(H8799)} a ship{H591} going{H935}{(H8802)} to Tarshish{H8659}: so he paid{H5414}{(H8799)} the fare{H7939} thereof, and went down{H3381}{(H8799)} into it, to go{H935}{(H8800)} with them unto Tarshish{H8659} from the presence{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jonah,1,4,"But the LORD{H3068} sent out{H2904}{(H8689)} a great{H1419} wind{H7307} into the sea{H3220}, and there was a mighty{H1419} tempest{H5591} in the sea{H3220}, so that the ship{H591} was like{H2803}{(H8765)} to be broken{H7665}{(H8736)}."
Jonah,1,5,"Then the mariners{H4419} were afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, and cried{H2199}{(H8799)} every man{H376} unto his god{H430}, and cast forth{H2904}{(H8686)} the wares{H3627} that were in the ship{H591} into the sea{H3220}, to lighten{H7043}{(H8687)} it of them. But Jonah{H3124} was gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} into the sides{H3411} of the ship{H5600}; and he lay{H7901}{(H8799)}, and was fast asleep{H7290}{(H8735)}."
Jonah,1,6,"So the shipmaster{H7227}{H2259} came{H7126}{(H8799)} to him, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper{H7290}{(H8737)}? arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, call{H7121}{(H8798)} upon thy God{H430}, if so be that God{H430} will think{H6245}{(H8691)} upon us, that we perish{H6}{(H8799)} not."
Jonah,1,7,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} every one{H376} to his fellow{H7453}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us cast{H5307}{(H8686)} lots{H1486}, that we may know{H3045}{(H8799)} for whose cause{H7945} this evil{H7451} is upon us. So they cast{H5307}{(H8686)} lots{H1486}, and the lot{H1486} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon Jonah{H3124}."
Jonah,1,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} they unto him, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil{H7451} is upon us; What is thine occupation{H4399}? and whence{H370} comest{H935}{(H8799)} thou? what is thy country{H776}? and of what people{H5971} art thou?"
Jonah,1,9,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I am an Hebrew{H5680}; and I fear{H3373} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of heaven{H8064}, which hath made{H6213}{(H8804)} the sea{H3220} and the dry{H3004} land."
Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men{H582} exceedingly{H1419}{H3374} afraid{H3372}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Why hast thou done{H6213}{(H8804)} this? For the men{H582} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} that he fled{H1272}{(H8802)} from the presence{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}, because he had told{H5046}{(H8689)} them."
Jonah,1,11,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} they unto him, What shall we do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto thee, that the sea{H3220} may be calm{H8367}{(H8799)} unto us? for the sea{H3220} wrought{H1980}{(H8802)}, and was tempestuous{H5590}{(H8802)}."
Jonah,1,12,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Take me up{H5375}{(H8798)}, and cast me forth{H2904}{(H8685)} into the sea{H3220}; so shall the sea{H3220} be calm{H8367}{(H8799)} unto you: for I know{H3045}{(H8802)} that for my sake{H7945} this great{H1419} tempest{H5591} is upon you."
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless the men{H582} rowed hard{H2864}{(H8799)} to bring{H7725}{(H8687)} it to the land{H3004}; but they could{H3201}{(H8804)} not: for the sea{H3220} wrought{H1980}{(H8802)}, and was tempestuous{H5590}{(H8802)} against them."
Jonah,1,14,"Wherefore they cried{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We beseech thee{H577}, O LORD{H3068}, we beseech thee, let us not perish{H6}{(H8799)} for this man's{H376} life{H5315}, and lay{H5414}{(H8799)} not upon us innocent{H5355}{(H8675)}{H5355} blood{H1818}: for thou, O LORD{H3068}, hast done{H6213}{(H8804)} as it pleased{H2654}{(H8804)} thee."
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up{H5375}{(H8799)} Jonah{H3124}, and cast him forth{H2904}{(H8686)} into the sea{H3220}: and the sea{H3220} ceased{H5975}{(H8799)} from her raging{H2197}."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men{H582} feared{H3372}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} exceedingly{H1419}{H3374}, and offered{H2076}{(H8799)} a sacrifice{H2077} unto the LORD{H3068}, and made{H5087}{(H8799)} vows{H5088}."
Jonah,1,17,Now the LORD{H3068} had prepared{H4487}{(H8762)} a great{H1419} fish{H1709} to swallow up{H1104}{(H8800)} Jonah{H3124}. And Jonah{H3124} was in the belly{H4578} of the fish{H1709} three{H7969} days{H3117} and three{H7969} nights{H3915}.
Jonah,2,1,"Then Jonah{H3124} prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068} his God{H430} out of the fish's{H1710} belly{H4578},"
Jonah,2,2,"And said{H559}{(H8799)}, I cried{H7121}{(H8804)} by reason of mine affliction{H6869} unto the LORD{H3068}, and he heard{H6030}{(H8799)} me; out of the belly{H990} of hell{H7585} cried{H7768}{(H8765)} I, and thou heardest{H8085}{(H8804)} my voice{H6963}."
Jonah,2,3,"For thou hadst cast{H7993}{(H8686)} me into the deep{H4688}, in the midst{H3824} of the seas{H3220}; and the floods{H5104} compassed{H5437}{(H8779)} me about: all thy billows{H4867} and thy waves{H1530} passed over{H5674}{(H8804)} me."
Jonah,2,4,"Then I said{H559}{(H8804)}, I am cast out{H1644}{(H8738)} of thy sight{H5869}; yet I will look{H5027}{(H8687)} again{H3254}{(H8686)} toward thy holy{H6944} temple{H1964}."
Jonah,2,5,"The waters{H4325} compassed me about{H661}{(H8804)}, even to the soul{H5315}: the depth{H8415} closed me round about{H5437}{(H8779)}, the weeds{H5488} were wrapped about{H2280}{(H8803)} my head{H7218}."
Jonah,2,6,"I went down{H3381}{(H8804)} to the bottoms{H7095} of the mountains{H2022}; the earth{H776} with her bars{H1280} was about me for ever{H5769}: yet hast thou brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} my life{H2416} from corruption{H7845}, O LORD{H3068} my God{H430}."
Jonah,2,7,"When my soul{H5315} fainted{H5848}{(H8692)} within me I remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}: and my prayer{H8605} came in{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee, into thine holy{H6944} temple{H1964}."
Jonah,2,8,They that observe{H8104}{(H8764)} lying{H7723} vanities{H1892} forsake{H5800}{(H8799)} their own mercy{H2617}.
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice{H2076}{(H8799)} unto thee with the voice{H6963} of thanksgiving{H8426}; I will pay{H7999}{(H8762)} that that I have vowed{H5087}{(H8804)}. Salvation{H3444} is of the LORD{H3068}.
Jonah,2,10,"And the LORD{H3068} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto the fish{H1709}, and it vomited out{H6958}{(H8686)} Jonah{H3124} upon the dry{H3004} land."
Jonah,3,1,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Jonah{H3124} the second{H8145} time, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jonah,3,2,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go{H3212}{(H8798)} unto Nineveh{H5210}, that great{H1419} city{H5892}, and preach{H7121}{(H8798)} unto it the preaching{H7150} that I bid{H1696}{(H8802)} thee."
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah{H3124} arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} unto Nineveh{H5210}, according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}. Now Nineveh{H5210} was an exceeding{H430} great{H1419} city{H5892} of three{H7969} days{H3117}' journey{H4109}."
Jonah,3,4,"And Jonah{H3124} began{H2490}{(H8686)} to enter{H935}{(H8800)} into the city{H5892} a{H259} day's{H3117} journey{H4109}, and he cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Yet forty{H705} days{H3117}, and Nineveh{H5210} shall be overthrown{H2015}{(H8737)}."
Jonah,3,5,"So the people{H582} of Nineveh{H5210} believed{H539}{(H8686)} God{H430}, and proclaimed{H7121}{(H8799)} a fast{H6685}, and put{H3847}{(H8799)} on sackcloth{H8242}, from the greatest{H1419} of them even to the least{H6996} of them."
Jonah,3,6,"For word{H1697} came{H5060}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Nineveh{H5210}, and he arose{H6965}{(H8799)} from his throne{H3678}, and he laid{H5674}{(H8686)} his robe{H155} from him, and covered{H3680}{(H8762)} him with sackcloth{H8242}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} in ashes{H665}."
Jonah,3,7,"And he caused it to be proclaimed{H2199}{(H8686)} and published{H559}{(H8799)} through Nineveh{H5210} by the decree{H2940} of the king{H4428} and his nobles{H1419}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let neither man{H120} nor beast{H929}, herd{H1241} nor flock{H6629}, taste{H2938}{(H8799)} any thing{H3972}: let them not feed{H7462}{(H8799)}, nor drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325}:"
Jonah,3,8,"But let man{H120} and beast{H929} be covered{H3680}{(H8691)} with sackcloth{H8242}, and cry{H7121}{(H8799)} mightily{H2394} unto God{H430}: yea, let them turn{H7725}{(H8799)} every one{H376} from his evil{H7451} way{H1870}, and from the violence{H2555} that is in their hands{H3709}."
Jonah,3,9,"Who can tell{H3045}{(H8802)} if God{H430} will turn{H7725}{(H8799)} and repent{H5162}{(H8738)}, and turn away{H7725}{(H8804)} from his fierce{H2740} anger{H639}, that we perish{H6}{(H8799)} not?"
Jonah,3,10,"And God{H430} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} their works{H4639}, that they turned{H7725}{(H8804)} from their evil{H7451} way{H1870}; and God{H430} repented{H5162}{(H8735)} of the evil{H7451}, that he had said{H1696}{(H8765)} that he would do{H6213}{(H8800)} unto them; and he did{H6213}{(H8804)} it not."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased{H3415}{(H8799)} Jonah{H3124} exceedingly{H1419}{H7451}, and he was very angry{H2734}{(H8799)}."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, I pray{H577} thee, O LORD{H3068}, was not this my saying{H1697}, when I was yet in my country{H127}? Therefore I fled{H1272}{(H8800)} before{H6923}{(H8765)} unto Tarshish{H8659}: for I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou art a gracious{H2587} God{H410}, and merciful{H7349}, slow{H750} to anger{H639}, and of great{H7227} kindness{H2617}, and repentest{H5162}{(H8737)} thee of the evil{H7451}."
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD{H3068}, take{H3947}{(H8798)}, I beseech thee, my life{H5315} from me; for it is better{H2896} for me to die{H4194} than to live{H2416}."
Jonah,4,4,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, Doest thou well{H3190}{(H8687)} to be angry{H2734}{(H8804)}?"
Jonah,4,5,"So Jonah{H3124} went out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the city{H5892}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} on the east side{H6924} of the city{H5892}, and there made{H6213}{(H8799)} him a booth{H5521}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} under it in the shadow{H6738}, till he might see{H7200}{(H8799)} what would become of the city{H5892}."
Jonah,4,6,"And the LORD{H3068} God{H430} prepared{H4487}{(H8762)} a gourd{H7021}, and made it to come up{H5927}{(H8799)} over Jonah{H3124}, that it might be a shadow{H6738} over his head{H7218}, to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} him from his grief{H7451}. So Jonah{H3124} was exceeding{H1419}{H8057} glad{H8055}{(H8799)} of the gourd{H7021}."
Jonah,4,7,"But God{H430} prepared{H4487}{(H8762)} a worm{H8438} when the morning{H7837} rose{H5927}{(H8800)} the next day{H4283}, and it smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the gourd{H7021} that it withered{H3001}{(H8799)}."
Jonah,4,8,"And it came to pass, when the sun{H8121} did arise{H2224}{(H8800)}, that God{H430} prepared{H4487}{(H8762)} a vehement{H2759} east{H6921} wind{H7307}; and the sun{H8121} beat{H5221}{(H8686)} upon the head{H7218} of Jonah{H3124}, that he fainted{H5968}{(H8691)}, and wished{H7592}{(H8799)} in himself{H5315} to die{H4191}{(H8800)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is better{H2896} for me to die{H4194} than to live{H2416}."
Jonah,4,9,"And God{H430} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Jonah{H3124}, Doest thou well{H3190}{(H8687)} to be angry{H2734}{(H8804)} for the gourd{H7021}? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, I do well{H3190}{(H8687)} to be angry{H2734}{(H8804)}, even unto death{H4194}."
Jonah,4,10,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}, Thou hast had pity{H2347}{(H8804)} on the gourd{H7021}, for the which thou hast not laboured{H5998}{(H8804)}, neither madest it grow{H1431}{(H8765)}; which came up in a night{H1121}{H3915}, and perished{H6}{(H8804)} in a night{H1121}{H3915}:"
Jonah,4,11,"And should not I spare{H2347}{(H8799)} Nineveh{H5210}, that great{H1419} city{H5892}, wherein are{H3426} more{H7235}{(H8687)} than sixscore{H8147}{H6240} thousand{H7239} persons{H120} that cannot discern{H3045}{(H8804)} between their right hand{H3225} and their left hand{H8040}; and also much{H7227} cattle{H929}?"
Micah,1,1,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} that came to Micah{H4318} the Morasthite{H4183} in the days{H3117} of Jotham{H3147}, Ahaz{H271}, and Hezekiah{H3169}, kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, which he saw{H2372}{(H8804)} concerning Samaria{H8111} and Jerusalem{H3389}."
Micah,1,2,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, all ye people{H5971}; hearken{H7181}{(H8685)}, O earth{H776}, and all that therein{H4393} is: and let the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} be witness{H5707} against you, the Lord{H136} from his holy{H6944} temple{H1964}."
Micah,1,3,"For, behold, the LORD{H3068} cometh forth{H3318}{(H8802)} out of his place{H4725}, and will come down{H3381}{(H8804)}, and tread{H1869}{(H8804)} upon the high places{H1116} of the earth{H776}."
Micah,1,4,"And the mountains{H2022} shall be molten{H4549}{(H8738)} under him, and the valleys{H6010} shall be cleft{H1234}{(H8691)}, as wax{H1749} before{H6440} the fire{H784}, and as the waters{H4325} that are poured{H5064}{(H8716)} down a steep place{H4174}."
Micah,1,5,"For the transgression{H6588} of Jacob{H3290} is all this, and for the sins{H2403} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}. What is the transgression{H6588} of Jacob{H3290}? is it not Samaria{H8111}? and what are the high places{H1116} of Judah{H3063}? are they not Jerusalem{H3389}?"
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make{H7760}{(H8804)} Samaria{H8111} as an heap{H5856} of the field{H7704}, and as plantings{H4302} of a vineyard{H3754}: and I will pour down{H5064}{(H8689)} the stones{H68} thereof into the valley{H1516}, and I will discover{H1540}{(H8762)} the foundations{H3247} thereof."
Micah,1,7,"And all the graven images{H6456} thereof shall be beaten to pieces{H3807}{(H8714)}, and all the hires{H868} thereof shall be burned{H8313}{(H8735)} with the fire{H784}, and all the idols{H6091} thereof will I lay{H7760}{(H8799)} desolate{H8077}: for she gathered{H6908}{(H8765)} it of the hire{H868} of an harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, and they shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} to the hire{H868} of an harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}."
Micah,1,8,"Therefore I will wail{H5594}{(H8799)} and howl{H3213}{(H8686)}, I will go{H3212}{(H8799)} stripped{H7758}{(H8675)}{H7758} and naked{H6174}: I will make{H6213}{(H8799)} a wailing{H4553} like the dragons{H8577}, and mourning{H60} as the owls{H1323}{H3284}."
Micah,1,9,"For her wound{H4347} is incurable{H605}{(H8803)}; for it is come{H935}{(H8804)} unto Judah{H3063}; he is come{H5060}{(H8804)} unto the gate{H8179} of my people{H5971}, even to Jerusalem{H3389}."
Micah,1,10,"Declare{H5046}{(H8686)} ye it not at Gath{H1661}, weep{H1058}{(H8799)} ye not at all{H1058}{(H8800)}: in the house of Aphrah{H1036} roll{H6428}{(H8690)}{(H8675)}{H6428}{(H8694)} thyself in the dust{H6083}."
Micah,1,11,"Pass ye away{H5674}{(H8798)}, thou inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of Saphir{H8208}, having thy shame{H1322} naked{H6181}: the inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of Zaanan{H6630} came not forth{H3318}{(H8804)} in the mourning{H4553} of Bethezel{H1018}; he shall receive{H3947}{(H8799)} of you his standing{H5979}."
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of Maroth{H4796} waited carefully{H2342}{(H8804)} for good{H2896}: but evil{H7451} came down{H3381}{(H8804)} from the LORD{H3068} unto the gate{H8179} of Jerusalem{H3389}.
Micah,1,13,"O thou inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of Lachish{H3923}, bind{H7573}{(H8798)} the chariot{H4818} to the swift beast{H7409}: she is the beginning{H7225} of the sin{H2403} to the daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}: for the transgressions{H6588} of Israel{H3478} were found{H4672}{(H8738)} in thee."
Micah,1,14,Therefore shalt thou give{H5414}{(H8799)} presents{H7964} to Moreshethgath{H4182}: the houses{H1004} of Achzib{H392} shall be a lie{H391} to the kings{H4428} of Israel{H3478}.
Micah,1,15,"Yet will I bring{H935}{(H8686)} an heir{H3423}{(H8802)} unto thee, O inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of Mareshah{H4762}: he shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto Adullam{H5725} the glory{H3519} of Israel{H3478}."
Micah,1,16,"Make thee bald{H7139}{(H8798)}, and poll{H1494}{(H8798)} thee for thy delicate{H8588} children{H1121}; enlarge{H7337}{(H8685)} thy baldness{H7144} as the eagle{H5404}; for they are gone into captivity{H1540}{(H8804)} from thee."
Micah,2,1,"Woe{H1945} to them that devise{H2803}{(H8802)} iniquity{H205}, and work{H6466}{(H8802)} evil{H7451} upon their beds{H4904}! when the morning{H1242} is light{H216}, they practise{H6213}{(H8799)} it, because it is{H3426} in the power{H410} of their hand{H3027}."
Micah,2,2,"And they covet{H2530}{(H8804)} fields{H7704}, and take them by violence{H1497}{(H8804)}; and houses{H1004}, and take them away{H5375}{(H8804)}: so they oppress{H6231}{(H8804)} a man{H1397} and his house{H1004}, even a man{H376} and his heritage{H5159}."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, against this family{H4940} do I devise{H2803}{(H8802)} an evil{H7451}, from which ye shall not remove{H4185}{(H8686)} your necks{H6677}; neither shall ye go{H3212}{(H8799)} haughtily{H7317}: for this time{H6256} is evil{H7451}."
Micah,2,4,"In that day{H3117} shall one take up{H5375}{(H8799)} a parable{H4912} against you, and lament{H5091}{(H8804)} with a doleful{H5093} lamentation{H5092}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, We be utterly{H7703}{(H8800)} spoiled{H7703}{(H8738)}: he hath changed{H4171}{(H8686)} the portion{H2506} of my people{H5971}: how hath he removed{H4185}{(H8686)} it from me! turning away{H7725}{(H8788)} he hath divided{H2505}{(H8762)} our fields{H7704}."
Micah,2,5,Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast{H7993}{(H8688)} a cord{H2256} by lot{H1486} in the congregation{H6951} of the LORD{H3068}.
Micah,2,6,"Prophesy{H5197}{(H8686)} ye not, say they to them that prophesy{H5197}{(H8686)}: they shall not prophesy{H5197}{(H8686)} to them, that they shall not take{H5253}{(H8799)} shame{H3639}."
Micah,2,7,"O thou that art named{H559}{(H8803)} the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290}, is the spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} straitened{H7114}{(H8804)}? are these his doings{H4611}? do not my words{H1697} do good{H3190}{(H8686)} to him that walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} uprightly{H3477}?"
Micah,2,8,Even of late{H865} my people{H5971} is risen up{H6965}{(H8787)} as an enemy{H341}{(H8802)}: ye pull off{H6584}{(H8686)} the robe{H145} with{H4136} the garment{H8008} from them that pass{H5674}{(H8802)} by securely{H983} as men averse{H7725}{(H8803)} from war{H4421}.
Micah,2,9,The women{H802} of my people{H5971} have ye cast out{H1644}{(H8762)} from their pleasant{H8588} houses{H1004}; from their children{H5768} have ye taken away{H3947}{(H8799)} my glory{H1926} for ever{H5769}.
Micah,2,10,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} ye, and depart{H3212}{(H8798)}; for this is not your rest{H4496}: because it is polluted{H2930}{(H8800)}, it shall destroy{H2254}{(H8762)} you, even with a sore{H4834}{(H8737)} destruction{H2256}."
Micah,2,11,"If{H3863} a man{H376} walking{H1980}{(H8802)} in the spirit{H7307} and falsehood{H8267} do lie{H3576}{(H8765)}, saying, I will prophesy{H5197}{(H8686)} unto thee of wine{H3196} and of strong drink{H7941}; he shall even be the prophet{H5197}{(H8688)} of this people{H5971}."
Micah,2,12,"I will surely{H622}{(H8800)} assemble{H622}{(H8799)}, O Jacob{H3290}, all of thee; I will surely{H6908}{(H8763)} gather{H6908}{(H8762)} the remnant{H7611} of Israel{H3478}; I will put{H7760}{(H8799)} them together{H3162} as the sheep{H6629} of Bozrah{H1223}{(H8677)}{H1224}, as the flock{H5739} in the midst{H8432} of their fold{H1699}: they shall make great noise{H1949}{(H8686)} by reason of the multitude of men{H120}."
Micah,2,13,"The breaker{H6555}{(H8802)} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them: they have broken up{H6555}{(H8804)}, and have passed through{H5674}{(H8799)} the gate{H8179}, and are gone out{H3318}{(H8799)} by it: and their king{H4428} shall pass{H5674}{(H8799)} before{H6440} them, and the LORD{H3068} on the head{H7218} of them."
Micah,3,1,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, I pray you, O heads{H7218} of Jacob{H3290}, and ye princes{H7101} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; Is it not for you to know{H3045}{(H8800)} judgment{H4941}?"
Micah,3,2,"Who hate{H8130}{(H8802)} the good{H2896}, and love{H157}{(H8802)} the evil{H7451}; who pluck off{H1497}{(H8802)} their skin{H5785} from off them, and their flesh{H7607} from off their bones{H6106};"
Micah,3,3,"Who also eat{H398}{(H8804)} the flesh{H7607} of my people{H5971}, and flay{H6584}{(H8689)} their skin{H5785} from off them; and they break{H6476}{(H8765)} their bones{H6106}, and chop them in pieces{H6566}{(H8804)}, as for the pot{H5518}, and as flesh{H1320} within{H8432} the caldron{H7037}."
Micah,3,4,"Then shall they cry{H2199}{(H8799)} unto the LORD{H3068}, but he will not hear{H6030}{(H8799)} them: he will even hide{H5641}{(H8686)} his face{H6440} from them at that time{H6256}, as they have behaved themselves ill{H7489}{(H8689)} in their doings{H4611}."
Micah,3,5,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} concerning the prophets{H5030} that make my people{H5971} err{H8582}{(H8688)}, that bite{H5391}{(H8802)} with their teeth{H8127}, and cry{H7121}{(H8804)}, Peace{H7965}; and he that putteth{H5414}{(H8799)} not into their mouths{H6310}, they even prepare{H6942}{(H8765)} war{H4421} against him."
Micah,3,6,"Therefore night{H3915} shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision{H2377}; and it shall be dark{H2821}{(H8675)}{H2821}{(H8804)} unto you, that ye shall not divine{H7080}{(H8800)}; and the sun{H8121} shall go down{H935}{(H8804)} over the prophets{H5030}, and the day{H3117} shall be dark{H6937}{(H8804)} over them."
Micah,3,7,"Then shall the seers{H2374} be ashamed{H954}{(H8804)}, and the diviners{H7080}{(H8802)} confounded{H2659}{(H8804)}: yea, they shall all cover{H5844}{(H8804)} their lips{H8222}; for there is no answer{H4617} of God{H430}."
Micah,3,8,"But truly{H199} I am full{H4390}{(H8804)} of power{H3581} by the spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068}, and of judgment{H4941}, and of might{H1369}, to declare{H5046}{(H8687)} unto Jacob{H3290} his transgression{H6588}, and to Israel{H3478} his sin{H2403}."
Micah,3,9,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} this, I pray you, ye heads{H7218} of the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290}, and princes{H7101} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, that abhor{H8581}{(H8764)} judgment{H4941}, and pervert{H6140}{(H8762)} all equity{H3477}."
Micah,3,10,"They build up{H1129}{(H8802)} Zion{H6726} with blood{H1818}, and Jerusalem{H3389} with iniquity{H5766}."
Micah,3,11,"The heads{H7218} thereof judge{H8199}{(H8799)} for reward{H7810}, and the priests{H3548} thereof teach{H3384}{(H8686)} for hire{H4242}, and the prophets{H5030} thereof divine{H7080}{(H8799)} for money{H3701}: yet will they lean{H8172}{(H8735)} upon the LORD{H3068}, and say{H559}{(H8800)}, Is not the LORD{H3068} among{H7130} us? none evil{H7451} can come{H935}{(H8799)} upon us."
Micah,3,12,"Therefore shall Zion{H6726} for your sake{H1558} be plowed{H2790}{(H8735)} as a field{H7704}, and Jerusalem{H3389} shall become heaps{H5856}, and the mountain{H2022} of the house{H1004} as the high places{H1116} of the forest{H3293}."
Micah,4,1,"But in the last{H319} days{H3117} it shall come to pass, that the mountain{H2022} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} shall be established{H3559}{(H8737)} in the top{H7218} of the mountains{H2022}, and it shall be exalted{H5375}{(H8737)} above the hills{H1389}; and people{H5971} shall flow{H5102}{(H8804)} unto it."
Micah,4,2,"And many{H7227} nations{H1471} shall come{H1980}{(H8804)}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us go up{H5927}{(H8799)} to the mountain{H2022} of the LORD{H3068}, and to the house{H1004} of the God{H430} of Jacob{H3290}; and he will teach{H3384}{(H8686)} us of his ways{H1870}, and we will walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in his paths{H734}: for the law{H8451} shall go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} of Zion{H6726}, and the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} from Jerusalem{H3389}."
Micah,4,3,"And he shall judge{H8199}{(H8804)} among many{H7227} people{H5971}, and rebuke{H3198}{(H8689)} strong{H6099} nations{H1471} afar off{H7350}; and they shall beat{H3807}{(H8765)} their swords{H2719} into plowshares{H855}, and their spears{H2595} into pruninghooks{H4211}: nation{H1471} shall not lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} a sword{H2719} against nation{H1471}, neither shall they learn{H3925}{(H8799)} war{H4421} any more."
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit{H3427}{(H8804)} every man{H376} under his vine{H1612} and under his fig tree{H8384}; and none shall make them afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}: for the mouth{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it.
Micah,4,5,"For all people{H5971} will walk{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} in the name{H8034} of his god{H430}, and we will walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} for ever{H5769} and ever{H5703}."
Micah,4,6,"In that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, will I assemble{H622}{(H8799)} her that halteth{H6760}{(H8802)}, and I will gather{H6908}{(H8762)} her that is driven out{H5080}{(H8737)}, and her that I have afflicted{H7489}{(H8689)};"
Micah,4,7,"And I will make{H7760}{(H8804)} her that halted{H6760}{(H8802)} a remnant{H7611}, and her that was cast far off{H1972}{(H8737)} a strong{H6099} nation{H1471}: and the LORD{H3068} shall reign{H4427}{(H8804)} over them in mount{H2022} Zion{H6726} from henceforth, even for{H5704} ever{H5769}."
Micah,4,8,"And thou, O tower{H4026} of the flock{H5739}{(H8677)}{H4029}, the strong hold{H6076} of the daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}, unto thee shall it come{H857}{(H8799)}, even the first{H7223} dominion{H4475}; the kingdom{H4467} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} to the daughter{H1323} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Micah,4,9,Now why dost thou cry{H7321}{(H8686)} out aloud{H7452}? is there no king{H4428} in thee? is thy counsellor{H3289}{(H8802)} perished{H6}{(H8804)}? for pangs{H2427} have taken{H2388}{(H8689)} thee as a woman in travail{H3205}{(H8802)}.
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain{H2342}{(H8798)}, and labour to bring forth{H1518}{(H8798)}, O daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}, like a woman in travail{H3205}{(H8802)}: for now shalt thou go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of the city{H7151}, and thou shalt dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in the field{H7704}, and thou shalt go{H935}{(H8804)} even to Babylon{H894}; there shalt thou be delivered{H5337}{(H8735)}; there the LORD{H3068} shall redeem{H1350}{(H8799)} thee from the hand{H3709} of thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
Micah,4,11,"Now also many{H7227} nations{H1471} are gathered{H622}{(H8738)} against thee, that say{H559}{(H8802)}, Let her be defiled{H2610}{(H8799)}, and let our eye{H5869} look{H2372}{(H8799)} upon Zion{H6726}."
Micah,4,12,"But they know{H3045}{(H8804)} not the thoughts{H4284} of the LORD{H3068}, neither understand{H995}{(H8689)} they his counsel{H6098}: for he shall gather{H6908}{(H8765)} them as the sheaves{H5995} into the floor{H1637}."
Micah,4,13,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} and thresh{H1758}{(H8798)}, O daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}: for I will make{H7760}{(H8799)} thine horn{H7161} iron{H1270}, and I will make{H7760}{(H8799)} thy hoofs{H6541} brass{H5154}: and thou shalt beat in pieces{H1854}{(H8689)} many{H7227} people{H5971}: and I will consecrate{H2763}{(H8689)} their gain{H1215} unto the LORD{H3068}, and their substance{H2428} unto the Lord{H113} of the whole earth{H776}."
Micah,5,1,"Now gather{H1413}{(H8704)} thyself in troops{H1416}, O daughter{H1323} of troops{H1416}: he hath laid{H7760}{(H8804)} siege{H4692} against us: they shall smite{H5221}{(H8686)} the judge{H8199}{(H8802)} of Israel{H3478} with a rod{H7626} upon the cheek{H3895}."
Micah,5,2,"But thou, Bethlehem{H1035} Ephratah{H672}, though thou be little{H6810} among the thousands{H505} of Judah{H3063}, yet out of thee shall he come forth{H3318}{(H8799)} unto me that is to be ruler{H4910}{(H8802)} in Israel{H3478}; whose goings forth{H4163} have been from of old{H6924}, from everlasting{H3117}{H5769}."
Micah,5,3,"Therefore will he give them up{H5414}{(H8799)}, until the time{H6256} that she which travaileth{H3205}{(H8802)} hath brought forth{H3205}{(H8804)}: then the remnant{H3499} of his brethren{H251} shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."
Micah,5,4,"And he shall stand{H5975}{(H8804)} and feed{H7462}{(H8804)} in the strength{H5797} of the LORD{H3068}, in the majesty{H1347} of the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} his God{H430}; and they shall abide{H3427}{(H8804)}: for now shall he be great{H1431}{(H8799)} unto the ends{H657} of the earth{H776}."
Micah,5,5,"And this man shall be the peace{H7965}, when the Assyrian{H804} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} into our land{H776}: and when he shall tread{H1869}{(H8799)} in our palaces{H759}, then shall we raise{H6965}{(H8689)} against him seven{H7651} shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}, and eight{H8083} principal{H5257} men{H120}."
Micah,5,6,"And they shall waste{H7462}{(H8804)} the land{H776} of Assyria{H804} with the sword{H2719}, and the land{H776} of Nimrod{H5248} in the entrances{H6607} thereof: thus shall he deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} us from the Assyrian{H804}, when he cometh{H935}{(H8799)} into our land{H776}, and when he treadeth{H1869}{(H8799)} within our borders{H1366}."
Micah,5,7,"And the remnant{H7611} of Jacob{H3290} shall be in the midst{H7130} of many{H7227} people{H5971} as a dew{H2919} from the LORD{H3068}, as the showers{H7241} upon the grass{H6212}, that tarrieth{H6960}{(H8762)} not for man{H376}, nor waiteth{H3176}{(H8762)} for the sons{H1121} of men{H120}."
Micah,5,8,"And the remnant{H7611} of Jacob{H3290} shall be among the Gentiles{H1471} in the midst{H7130} of many{H7227} people{H5971} as a lion{H738} among the beasts{H929} of the forest{H3293}, as a young lion{H3715} among the flocks{H5739} of sheep{H6629}: who, if he go through{H5674}{(H8804)}, both treadeth down{H7429}{(H8804)}, and teareth in pieces{H2963}{(H8804)}, and none can deliver{H5337}{(H8688)}."
Micah,5,9,"Thine hand{H3027} shall be lifted up{H7311}{(H8799)} upon thine adversaries{H6862}, and all thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)} shall be cut off{H3772}{(H8735)}."
Micah,5,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} thy horses{H5483} out of the midst{H7130} of thee, and I will destroy{H6}{(H8689)} thy chariots{H4818}:"
Micah,5,11,"And I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} the cities{H6145}{(H8676)}{H5892} of thy land{H776}, and throw down{H2040}{(H8804)} all thy strong holds{H4013}:"
Micah,5,12,And I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} witchcrafts{H3785} out of thine hand{H3027}; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers{H6049}{(H8781)}:
Micah,5,13,"Thy graven images{H6456} also will I cut off{H3772}{(H8689)}, and thy standing images{H4676} out of the midst{H7130} of thee; and thou shalt no more worship{H7812}{(H8691)} the work{H4639} of thine hands{H3027}."
Micah,5,14,And I will pluck up{H5428}{(H8804)} thy groves{H842} out of the midst{H7130} of thee: so will I destroy{H8045}{(H8689)} thy cities{H6145}{(H8676)}{H5892}.
Micah,5,15,"And I will execute{H6213}{(H8804)} vengeance{H5359} in anger{H639} and fury{H2534} upon the heathen{H1471}, such as they have not heard{H8085}{(H8804)}."
Micah,6,1,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye now what the LORD{H3068} saith{H559}{(H8802)}; Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, contend{H7378}{(H8798)} thou before the mountains{H2022}, and let the hills{H1389} hear{H8085}{(H8799)} thy voice{H6963}."
Micah,6,2,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye, O mountains{H2022}, the LORD'S{H3068} controversy{H7379}, and ye strong{H386} foundations{H4146} of the earth{H776}: for the LORD{H3068} hath a controversy{H7379} with his people{H5971}, and he will plead{H3198}{(H8691)} with Israel{H3478}."
Micah,6,3,"O my people{H5971}, what have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto thee? and wherein have I wearied{H3811}{(H8689)} thee? testify{H6030}{(H8798)} against me."
Micah,6,4,"For I brought thee up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} thee out of the house{H1004} of servants{H5650}; and I sent{H7971}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee Moses{H4872}, Aaron{H175}, and Miriam{H4813}."
Micah,6,5,"O my people{H5971}, remember{H2142}{(H8798)} now what Balak{H1111} king{H4428} of Moab{H4124} consulted{H3289}{(H8804)}, and what Balaam{H1109} the son{H1121} of Beor{H1160} answered{H6030}{(H8804)} him from Shittim{H7851} unto Gilgal{H1537}; that ye may know{H3045}{(H8800)} the righteousness{H6666} of the LORD{H3068}."
Micah,6,6,"Wherewith shall I come before{H6923}{(H8762)} the LORD{H3068}, and bow{H3721}{(H8735)} myself before the high{H4791} God{H430}? shall I come before{H6923}{(H8762)} him with burnt offerings{H5930}, with calves{H5695} of a year{H8141} old{H1121}?"
Micah,6,7,"Will the LORD{H3068} be pleased{H7521}{(H8799)} with thousands{H505} of rams{H352}, or with ten thousands{H7233} of rivers{H5158} of oil{H8081}? shall I give{H5414}{(H8799)} my firstborn{H1060} for my transgression{H6588}, the fruit{H6529} of my body{H990} for the sin{H2403} of my soul{H5315}?"
Micah,6,8,"He hath shewed{H5046}{(H8689)} thee, O man{H120}, what is good{H2896}; and what doth the LORD{H3068} require{H1875}{(H8802)} of thee, but to do{H6213}{(H8800)} justly{H4941}, and to love{H160} mercy{H2617}, and to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} humbly{H6800}{(H8687)} with thy God{H430}?"
Micah,6,9,"The LORD'S{H3068} voice{H6963} crieth{H7121}{(H8799)} unto the city{H5892}, and the man of wisdom{H8454} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} thy name{H8034}: hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the rod{H4294}, and who hath appointed{H3259}{(H8804)} it."
Micah,6,10,"Are there{H786} yet the treasures{H214} of wickedness{H7562}{(H8676)}{H376} in the house{H1004} of the wicked{H7563}, and the scant{H7332} measure{H374} that is abominable{H2194}{(H8803)}?"
Micah,6,11,"Shall I count them pure{H2135}{(H8799)} with the wicked{H7562} balances{H3976}, and with the bag{H3599} of deceitful{H4820} weights{H68}?"
Micah,6,12,"For the rich men{H6223} thereof are full{H4390}{(H8804)} of violence{H2555}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} lies{H8267}, and their tongue{H3956} is deceitful{H7423} in their mouth{H6310}."
Micah,6,13,"Therefore also will I make thee sick{H2470}{(H8689)} in smiting{H5221}{(H8687)} thee, in making thee desolate{H8074}{(H8687)} because of thy sins{H2403}."
Micah,6,14,"Thou shalt eat{H398}{(H8799)}, but not be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)}; and thy casting down{H3445} shall be in the midst{H7130} of thee; and thou shalt take hold{H5253}{(H8686)}, but shalt not deliver{H6403}{(H8686)}; and that which thou deliverest{H6403}{(H8762)} will I give up{H5414}{(H8799)} to the sword{H2719}."
Micah,6,15,"Thou shalt sow{H2232}{(H8799)}, but thou shalt not reap{H7114}{(H8799)}; thou shalt tread{H1869}{(H8799)} the olives{H2132}, but thou shalt not anoint{H5480}{(H8799)} thee with oil{H8081}; and sweet wine{H8492}, but shalt not drink{H8354}{(H8799)} wine{H3196}."
Micah,6,16,"For the statutes{H2708} of Omri{H6018} are kept{H8104}{(H8691)}, and all the works{H4639} of the house{H1004} of Ahab{H256}, and ye walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in their counsels{H4156}; that I should make{H5414}{(H8800)} thee a desolation{H8047}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof an hissing{H8322}: therefore ye shall bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the reproach{H2781} of my people{H5971}."
Micah,7,1,"Woe{H480} is me! for I am as when they have gathered{H625} the summer fruits{H7019}, as the grapegleanings{H5955} of the vintage{H1210}: there is no cluster{H811} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}: my soul{H5315} desired{H183}{(H8765)} the firstripe fruit{H1063}."
Micah,7,2,The good{H2623} man is perished{H6}{(H8804)} out of the earth{H776}: and there is none upright{H3477} among men{H120}: they all lie in wait{H693}{(H8799)} for blood{H1818}; they hunt{H6679}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his brother{H251} with a net{H2764}.
Micah,7,3,"That they may do evil{H7451} with both hands{H3709} earnestly{H3190}{(H8687)}, the prince{H8269} asketh{H7592}{(H8802)}, and the judge{H8199}{(H8802)} asketh for a reward{H7966}; and the great{H1419} man, he uttereth{H1696}{(H8802)} his mischievous{H1942} desire{H5315}: so they wrap it up{H5686}{(H8762)}."
Micah,7,4,The best{H2896} of them is as a brier{H2312}: the most upright{H3477} is sharper than a thorn hedge{H4534}: the day{H3117} of thy watchmen{H6822}{(H8764)} and thy visitation{H6486} cometh{H935}{(H8804)}; now shall be their perplexity{H3998}.
Micah,7,5,"Trust{H539}{(H8686)} ye not in a friend{H7453}, put ye not confidence{H982}{(H8799)} in a guide{H441}: keep{H8104}{(H8798)} the doors{H6607} of thy mouth{H6310} from her that lieth{H7901}{(H8802)} in thy bosom{H2436}."
Micah,7,6,"For the son{H1121} dishonoureth{H5034}{(H8764)} the father{H1}, the daughter{H1323} riseth up{H6965}{(H8801)} against her mother{H517}, the daughter in law{H3618} against her mother in law{H2545}; a man's{H376} enemies{H341}{(H8802)} are the men{H582} of his own house{H1004}."
Micah,7,7,Therefore I will look{H6822}{(H8762)} unto the LORD{H3068}; I will wait{H3176}{(H8686)} for the God{H430} of my salvation{H3468}: my God{H430} will hear{H8085}{(H8799)} me.
Micah,7,8,"Rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} not against me, O mine enemy{H341}{(H8802)}: when I fall{H5307}{(H8804)}, I shall arise{H6965}{(H8804)}; when I sit{H3427}{(H8799)} in darkness{H2822}, the LORD{H3068} shall be a light{H216} unto me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the indignation{H2197} of the LORD{H3068}, because I have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against him, until he plead{H7378}{(H8799)} my cause{H7379}, and execute{H6213}{(H8804)} judgment{H4941} for me: he will bring me forth{H3318}{(H8686)} to the light{H216}, and I shall behold{H7200}{(H8799)} his righteousness{H6666}."
Micah,7,10,"Then she that is mine enemy{H341}{(H8802)} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and shame{H955} shall cover{H3680}{(H8762)} her which said{H559}{(H8802)} unto me, Where is the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}? mine eyes{H5869} shall behold{H7200}{(H8799)} her: now shall she be trodden down{H4823} as the mire{H2916} of the streets{H2351}."
Micah,7,11,"In the day{H3117} that thy walls{H1447} are to be built{H1129}{(H8800)}, in that day{H3117} shall the decree{H2706} be far removed{H7368}{(H8799)}."
Micah,7,12,"In that day{H3117} also he shall come{H935}{(H8799)} even to thee from Assyria{H804}, and from the fortified{H4693} cities{H5892}, and from the fortress{H4693} even to the river{H5104}, and from sea{H3220} to sea{H3220}, and from mountain{H2022} to mountain{H2022}."
Micah,7,13,"Notwithstanding the land{H776} shall be desolate{H8077} because of them that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein, for the fruit{H6529} of their doings{H4611}."
Micah,7,14,"Feed{H7462}{(H8798)} thy people{H5971} with thy rod{H7626}, the flock{H6629} of thine heritage{H5159}, which dwell{H7931}{(H8802)} solitarily{H910} in the wood{H3293}, in the midst{H8432} of Carmel{H3760}: let them feed{H7462}{(H8799)} in Bashan{H1316} and Gilead{H1568}, as in the days{H3117} of old{H5769}."
Micah,7,15,According to the days{H3117} of thy coming{H3318}{(H8800)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} will I shew{H7200}{(H8686)} unto him marvellous{H6381}{(H8737)} things.
Micah,7,16,"The nations{H1471} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} and be confounded{H954}{(H8799)} at all their might{H1369}: they shall lay{H7760}{(H8799)} their hand{H3027} upon their mouth{H6310}, their ears{H241} shall be deaf{H2790}{(H8799)}."
Micah,7,17,"They shall lick{H3897}{(H8762)} the dust{H6083} like a serpent{H5175}, they shall move{H7264}{(H8799)} out of their holes{H4526} like worms{H2119}{(H8801)} of the earth{H776}: they shall be afraid{H6342}{(H8799)} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, and shall fear{H3372}{(H8799)} because of thee."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God{H410} like unto thee, that pardoneth{H5375}{(H8802)} iniquity{H5771}, and passeth by{H5674}{(H8802)} the transgression{H6588} of the remnant{H7611} of his heritage{H5159}? he retaineth{H2388}{(H8689)} not his anger{H639} for ever{H5703}, because he delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} in mercy{H2617}."
Micah,7,19,"He will turn again{H7725}{(H8799)}, he will have compassion{H7355}{(H8762)} upon us; he will subdue{H3533}{(H8799)} our iniquities{H5771}; and thou wilt cast{H7993}{(H8686)} all their sins{H2403} into the depths{H4688} of the sea{H3220}."
Micah,7,20,"Thou wilt perform{H5414}{(H8799)} the truth{H571} to Jacob{H3290}, and the mercy{H2617} to Abraham{H85}, which thou hast sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} unto our fathers{H1} from the days{H3117} of old{H6924}."
Nahum,1,1,The burden{H4853} of Nineveh{H5210}. The book{H5612} of the vision{H2377} of Nahum{H5151} the Elkoshite{H512}.
Nahum,1,2,"God{H410} is jealous{H7072}, and the LORD{H3068} revengeth{H5358}{(H8802)}; the LORD{H3068} revengeth{H5358}{(H8802)}, and is furious{H1167}{H2534}; the LORD{H3068} will take vengeance{H5358}{(H8802)} on his adversaries{H6862}, and he reserveth{H5201}{(H8802)} wrath for his enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD{H3068} is slow{H750} to anger{H639}, and great{H1419} in power{H3581}, and will not at all{H5352}{(H8763)} acquit{H5352}{(H8762)} the wicked: the LORD{H3068} hath his way{H1870} in the whirlwind{H5492} and in the storm{H8183}, and the clouds{H6051} are the dust{H80} of his feet{H7272}."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebuketh{H1605}{(H8802)} the sea{H3220}, and maketh it dry{H2717}{(H8689)}, and drieth up{H3001}{(H8762)} all the rivers{H5104}: Bashan{H1316} languisheth{H535}{(H8797)}, and Carmel{H3760}, and the flower{H6525} of Lebanon{H3844} languisheth{H535}{(H8797)}."
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains{H2022} quake{H7493}{(H8804)} at him, and the hills{H1389} melt{H4127}{(H8712)}, and the earth{H776} is burned{H5375}{(H8799)} at his presence{H6440}, yea, the world{H8398}, and all that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} his indignation{H2195}? and who can abide{H6965}{(H8799)} in the fierceness{H2740} of his anger{H639}? his fury{H2534} is poured out{H5413}{(H8738)} like fire{H784}, and the rocks{H6697} are thrown down{H5422}{(H8738)} by him."
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD{H3068} is good{H2896}, a strong hold{H4581} in the day{H3117} of trouble{H6869}; and he knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} them that trust{H2620}{(H8802)} in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning{H5674}{(H8802)} flood{H7858} he will make{H6213}{(H8799)} an utter end{H3617} of the place{H4725} thereof, and darkness{H2822} shall pursue{H7291}{(H8762)} his enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
Nahum,1,9,What do ye imagine{H2803}{(H8762)} against the LORD{H3068}? he will make{H6213}{(H8802)} an utter end{H3617}: affliction{H6869} shall not rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} the second time{H6471}.
Nahum,1,10,"For while they be folden together{H5440}{(H8803)} as thorns{H5518}, and while they are drunken{H5433}{(H8803)} as drunkards{H5435}, they shall be devoured{H398}{(H8795)} as stubble{H7179} fully{H4392} dry{H3002}."
Nahum,1,11,"There is one come out{H3318}{(H8804)} of thee, that imagineth{H2803}{(H8802)} evil{H7451} against the LORD{H3068}, a wicked{H1100} counsellor{H3289}{(H8802)}."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Though they be quiet{H8003}, and likewise many{H7227}, yet thus shall they be cut down{H1494}{(H8738)}, when he shall pass through{H5674}{(H8804)}. Though I have afflicted{H6031}{(H8765)} thee, I will afflict{H6031}{(H8762)} thee no more."
Nahum,1,13,"For now will I break{H7665}{(H8799)} his yoke{H4132} from off thee, and will burst{H5423} thy bonds{H4147} in sunder{H5423}{(H8762)}."
Nahum,1,14,"And the LORD{H3068} hath given a commandment{H6680}{(H8765)} concerning thee, that no more of thy name{H8034} be sown{H2232}{(H8735)}: out of the house{H1004} of thy gods{H430} will I cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} the graven image{H6459} and the molten image{H4541}: I will make{H7760}{(H8799)} thy grave{H6913}; for thou art vile{H7043}{(H8804)}."
Nahum,1,15,"Behold upon the mountains{H2022} the feet{H7272} of him that bringeth good tidings{H1319}{(H8764)}, that publisheth{H8085}{(H8688)} peace{H7965}! O Judah{H3063}, keep{H2287}{(H8798)} thy solemn feasts{H2282}, perform{H7999}{(H8761)} thy vows{H5088}: for the wicked{H1100} shall no more{H3254}{(H8686)} pass through{H5674}{(H8800)} thee; he is utterly cut off{H3772}{(H8738)}."
Nahum,2,1,"He that dasheth in pieces{H6327}{(H8688)} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} before thy face{H6440}: keep{H5341}{(H8800)} the munition{H4694}, watch{H6822}{(H8761)} the way{H1870}, make thy loins{H4975} strong{H2388}{(H8761)}, fortify{H553}{(H8761)} thy power{H3581} mightily{H3966}."
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD{H3068} hath turned away{H7725}{(H8804)} the excellency{H1347} of Jacob{H3290}, as the excellency{H1347} of Israel{H3478}: for the emptiers{H1238}{(H8802)} have emptied them out{H1238}{(H8804)}, and marred{H7843}{(H8765)} their vine branches{H2156}."
Nahum,2,3,"The shield{H4043} of his mighty men{H1368} is made red{H119}{(H8794)}, the valiant{H2428} men{H582} are in scarlet{H8529}{(H8794)}: the chariots{H7393} shall be with flaming{H784} torches{H6393} in the day{H3117} of his preparation{H3559}{(H8687)}, and the fir trees{H1265} shall be terribly shaken{H7477}{(H8717)}."
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots{H7393} shall rage{H1984}{(H8704)} in the streets{H2351}, they shall justle one against another{H8264}{(H8698)} in the broad ways{H7339}: they shall seem{H4758} like torches{H3940}, they shall run{H7323}{(H8787)} like the lightnings{H1300}."
Nahum,2,5,"He shall recount{H2142}{(H8799)} his worthies{H117}: they shall stumble{H3782}{(H8735)} in their walk{H1979}; they shall make haste{H4116}{(H8762)} to the wall{H2346} thereof, and the defence{H5526}{(H8802)} shall be prepared{H3559}{(H8717)}."
Nahum,2,6,"The gates{H8179} of the rivers{H5104} shall be opened{H6605}{(H8738)}, and the palace{H1964} shall be dissolved{H4127}{(H8738)}."
Nahum,2,7,"And Huzzab{H5324}{(H8717)} shall be led away captive{H1540}{(H8795)}, she shall be brought up{H5927}{(H8717)}, and her maids{H519} shall lead{H5090}{(H8764)} her as with the voice{H6963} of doves{H3123}, tabering{H8608}{(H8781)} upon their breasts{H3824}."
Nahum,2,8,"But Nineveh{H5210} is of old{H3117} like a pool{H1295} of water{H4325}: yet they shall flee away{H5127}{(H8801)}. Stand{H5975}{(H8798)}, stand{H5975}{(H8798)}, shall they cry; but none shall look back{H6437}{(H8688)}."
Nahum,2,9,"Take ye the spoil{H962}{(H8798)} of silver{H3701}, take the spoil{H962}{(H8798)} of gold{H2091}: for there is none end{H7097} of the store{H8498} and glory{H3519} out of all the pleasant{H2532} furniture{H3627}."
Nahum,2,10,"She is empty{H950}, and void{H4003}, and waste{H1110}{(H8794)}: and the heart{H3820} melteth{H4549}{(H8738)}, and the knees{H1290} smite together{H6375}, and much pain{H2479} is in all loins{H4975}, and the faces{H6440} of them all gather{H6908}{(H8765)} blackness{H6289}."
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the dwelling{H4583} of the lions{H738}, and the feedingplace{H4829} of the young lions{H3715}, where the lion{H738}, even the old lion{H3833}, walked{H1980}{(H8804)}, and the lion's{H738} whelp{H1482}, and none made them afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion{H738} did tear in pieces{H2963}{(H8802)} enough{H1767} for his whelps{H1484}, and strangled{H2614}{(H8764)} for his lionesses{H3833}, and filled{H4390}{(H8762)} his holes{H2356} with prey{H2964}, and his dens{H4585} with ravin{H2966}."
Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I am against thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, and I will burn{H1197}{(H8689)} her chariots{H7393} in the smoke{H6227}, and the sword{H2719} shall devour{H398}{(H8799)} thy young lions{H3715}: and I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} thy prey{H2964} from the earth{H776}, and the voice{H6963} of thy messengers{H4397} shall no more be heard{H8085}{(H8735)}."
Nahum,3,1,Woe{H1945} to the bloody{H1818} city{H5892}! it is all full{H4392} of lies{H3585} and robbery{H6563}; the prey{H2964} departeth{H4185}{(H8686)} not;
Nahum,3,2,"The noise{H6963} of a whip{H7752}, and the noise{H6963} of the rattling{H7494} of the wheels{H212}, and of the pransing{H1725}{(H8802)} horses{H5483}, and of the jumping{H7540}{(H8764)} chariots{H4818}."
Nahum,3,3,"The horseman{H6571} lifteth up{H5927}{(H8688)} both the bright{H3851} sword{H2719} and the glittering{H1300} spear{H2595}: and there is a multitude{H7230} of slain{H2491}, and a great{H3514} number of carcases{H6297}; and there is none end{H7097} of their corpses{H1472}; they stumble{H3782}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H3782}{(H8735)} upon their corpses{H1472}:"
Nahum,3,4,"Because of the multitude{H7230} of the whoredoms{H2183} of the wellfavoured{H2896}{H2580} harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, the mistress{H1172} of witchcrafts{H3785}, that selleth{H4376}{(H8802)} nations{H1471} through her whoredoms{H2183}, and families{H4940} through her witchcrafts{H3785}."
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I am against thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; and I will discover{H1540}{(H8765)} thy skirts{H7757} upon thy face{H6440}, and I will shew{H7200}{(H8689)} the nations{H1471} thy nakedness{H4626}, and the kingdoms{H4467} thy shame{H7036}."
Nahum,3,6,"And I will cast{H7993}{(H8689)} abominable filth{H8251} upon thee, and make thee vile{H5034}{(H8765)}, and will set{H7760}{(H8804)} thee as a gazingstock{H7210}."
Nahum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look{H7200}{(H8802)} upon thee shall flee{H5074}{(H8799)} from thee, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Nineveh{H5210} is laid waste{H7703}{(H8795)}: who will bemoan{H5110}{(H8799)} her? whence{H370} shall I seek{H1245}{(H8762)} comforters{H5162}{(H8764)} for thee?"
Nahum,3,8,"Art thou better{H3190}{(H8686)} than populous{H527}{(H8675)}{H528} No{H4996}, that was situate{H3427}{(H8802)} among the rivers{H2975}, that had the waters{H4325} round about{H5439} it, whose rampart{H2426} was the sea{H3220}, and her wall{H2346} was from the sea{H3220}?"
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia{H3568} and Egypt{H4714} were her strength{H6109}, and it was infinite{H369}{H7097}; Put{H6316} and Lubim{H3864} were thy helpers{H5833}."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet was she carried away{H1473}, she went{H1980}{(H8804)} into captivity{H7628}: her young children{H5768} also were dashed in pieces{H7376}{(H8792)} at the top{H7218} of all the streets{H2351}: and they cast{H3032}{(H8804)} lots{H1486} for her honourable men{H3513}{(H8737)}, and all her great men{H1419} were bound{H7576}{(H8795)} in chains{H2131}."
Nahum,3,11,"Thou also shalt be drunken{H7937}{(H8799)}: thou shalt be hid{H5956}{(H8737)}, thou also shalt seek{H1245}{(H8762)} strength{H4581} because of the enemy{H341}{(H8802)}."
Nahum,3,12,"All thy strong holds{H4013} shall be like fig trees{H8384} with the firstripe figs{H1061}: if they be shaken{H5128}{(H8735)}, they shall even fall{H5307}{(H8804)} into the mouth{H6310} of the eater{H398}{(H8802)}."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, thy people{H5971} in the midst{H7130} of thee are women{H802}: the gates{H8179} of thy land{H776} shall be set wide{H6605}{(H8800)} open{H6605}{(H8738)} unto thine enemies{H341}{(H8802)}: the fire{H784} shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} thy bars{H1280}."
Nahum,3,14,"Draw{H7579}{(H8798)} thee waters{H4325} for the siege{H4692}, fortify{H2388}{(H8761)} thy strong holds{H4013}: go{H935}{(H8798)} into clay{H2916}, and tread{H7429}{(H8798)} the morter{H2563}, make strong{H2388}{(H8685)} the brickkiln{H4404}."
Nahum,3,15,"There shall the fire{H784} devour{H398}{(H8799)} thee; the sword{H2719} shall cut thee off{H3772}{(H8686)}, it shall eat thee up{H398}{(H8799)} like the cankerworm{H3218}: make thyself many{H3513}{(H8690)} as the cankerworm{H3218}, make thyself many{H3513}{(H8690)} as the locusts{H697}."
Nahum,3,16,"Thou hast multiplied{H7235}{(H8689)} thy merchants{H7402}{(H8802)} above the stars{H3556} of heaven{H8064}: the cankerworm{H3218} spoileth{H6584}{(H8804)}, and flieth away{H5774}{(H8799)}."
Nahum,3,17,"Thy crowned{H4502} are as the locusts{H697}, and thy captains{H2951} as the great grasshoppers{H1462}, which camp{H2583}{(H8802)} in the hedges{H1448} in the cold{H7135} day{H3117}, but when the sun{H8121} ariseth{H2224}{(H8804)} they flee away{H5074}{(H8776)}, and their place{H4725} is not known{H3045}{(H8738)} where{H335} they are."
Nahum,3,18,"Thy shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} slumber{H5123}{(H8804)}, O king{H4428} of Assyria{H804}: thy nobles{H117} shall dwell{H7931}{(H8799)} in the dust: thy people{H5971} is scattered{H6335}{(H8738)} upon the mountains{H2022}, and no man gathereth{H6908}{(H8764)} them."
Nahum,3,19,There is no healing{H3545} of thy bruise{H7667}; thy wound{H4347} is grievous{H2470}{(H8737)}: all that hear{H8085}{(H8802)} the bruit{H8088} of thee shall clap{H8628}{(H8804)} the hands{H3709} over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness{H7451} passed{H5674}{(H8804)} continually{H8548}?
Habakkuk,1,1,The burden{H4853} which Habakkuk{H2265} the prophet{H5030} did see{H2372}{(H8804)}.
Habakkuk,1,2,"O LORD{H3068}, how long shall I cry{H7768}{(H8765)}, and thou wilt not hear{H8085}{(H8799)}! even cry out{H2199}{(H8799)} unto thee of violence{H2555}, and thou wilt not save{H3467}{(H8686)}!"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why dost thou shew{H7200}{(H8686)} me iniquity{H205}, and cause me to behold{H5027}{(H8686)} grievance{H5999}? for spoiling{H7701} and violence{H2555} are before me: and there are that raise up{H5375}{(H8799)} strife{H7379} and contention{H4066}."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law{H8451} is slacked{H6313}{(H8799)}, and judgment{H4941} doth never{H5331} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}: for the wicked{H7563} doth compass{H3803}{(H8688)} about the righteous{H6662}; therefore wrong{H6127}{(H8794)} judgment{H4941} proceedeth{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Habakkuk,1,5,"Behold{H7200}{(H8798)} ye among the heathen{H1471}, and regard{H5027}{(H8685)}, and wonder{H8539}{(H8690)} marvellously{H8539}{(H8798)}: for I will work{H6466}{(H8802)} a work{H6467} in your days{H3117}, which ye will not believe{H539}{(H8686)}, though it be told{H5608}{(H8792)} you."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For, lo, I raise up{H6965}{(H8688)} the Chaldeans{H3778}, that bitter{H4751} and hasty{H4116}{(H8737)} nation{H1471}, which shall march{H1980}{(H8802)} through the breadth{H4800} of the land{H776}, to possess{H3423}{(H8800)} the dwellingplaces{H4908} that are not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are terrible{H366} and dreadful{H3372}{(H8737)}: their judgment{H4941} and their dignity{H7613} shall proceed{H3318}{(H8799)} of themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses{H5483} also are swifter{H7043}{(H8804)} than the leopards{H5246}, and are more fierce{H2300}{(H8804)} than the evening{H6153} wolves{H2061}: and their horsemen{H6571} shall spread{H6335}{(H8804)} themselves, and their horsemen{H6571} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} from far{H7350}; they shall fly{H5774}{(H8799)} as the eagle{H5404} that hasteth{H2363}{(H8804)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)}."
Habakkuk,1,9,"They shall come{H935}{(H8799)} all for violence{H2555}: their faces{H6440} shall sup up{H4041} as the east wind{H6921}, and they shall gather{H622}{(H8799)} the captivity{H7628} as the sand{H2344}."
Habakkuk,1,10,"And they shall scoff{H7046}{(H8691)} at the kings{H4428}, and the princes{H7336}{(H8802)} shall be a scorn{H4890} unto them: they shall deride{H7832}{(H8799)} every strong hold{H4013}; for they shall heap{H6651}{(H8799)} dust{H6083}, and take{H3920}{(H8799)} it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then shall his mind{H7307} change{H2498}{(H8804)}, and he shall pass over{H5674}{(H8799)}, and offend{H816}{(H8804)}, imputing this{H2098} his power{H3581} unto his god{H433}."
Habakkuk,1,12,"Art thou not from everlasting{H6924}, O LORD{H3068} my God{H430}, mine Holy One{H6918}? we shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)}. O LORD{H3068}, thou hast ordained{H7760}{(H8804)} them for judgment{H4941}; and, O mighty God{H6697}, thou hast established{H3245}{(H8804)} them for correction{H3198}{(H8687)}."
Habakkuk,1,13,"Thou art of purer{H2889} eyes{H5869} than to behold{H7200}{(H8800)} evil{H7451}, and canst{H3201}{(H8799)} not look{H5027}{(H8687)} on iniquity{H5999}: wherefore lookest{H5027}{(H8686)} thou upon them that deal treacherously{H898}{(H8802)}, and holdest thy tongue{H2790}{(H8686)} when the wicked{H7563} devoureth{H1104}{(H8763)} the man that is more righteous{H6662} than he?"
Habakkuk,1,14,"And makest{H6213}{(H8799)} men{H120} as the fishes{H1709} of the sea{H3220}, as the creeping things{H7431}, that have no ruler{H4910}{(H8802)} over them?"
Habakkuk,1,15,"They take up{H5927}{(H8689)} all of them with the angle{H2443}, they catch{H1641}{(H8799)} them in their net{H2764}, and gather{H622}{(H8799)} them in their drag{H4365}: therefore they rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} and are glad{H1523}{(H8799)}."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore they sacrifice{H2076}{(H8762)} unto their net{H2764}, and burn incense{H6999}{(H8762)} unto their drag{H4365}; because by them{H1992} their portion{H2506} is fat{H8082}, and their meat{H3978} plenteous{H1277}."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Shall they therefore empty{H7324}{(H8686)} their net{H2764}, and not spare{H2550}{(H8799)} continually{H8548} to slay{H2026}{(H8800)} the nations{H1471}?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand{H5975}{(H8799)} upon my watch{H4931}, and set{H3320}{(H8691)} me upon the tower{H4692}, and will watch{H6822}{(H8762)} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} what he will say{H1696}{(H8762)} unto me, and what I shall answer{H7725}{(H8686)} when I am reproved{H8433}."
Habakkuk,2,2,"And the LORD{H3068} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} me, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Write{H3789}{(H8798)} the vision{H2377}, and make it plain{H874}{(H8761)} upon tables{H3871}, that he may run{H7323}{(H8799)} that readeth{H7121}{(H8802)} it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision{H2377} is yet for an appointed time{H4150}, but at the end{H7093} it shall speak{H6315}{(H8686)}, and not lie{H3576}{(H8762)}: though it tarry{H4102}{(H8698)}, wait{H2442}{(H8761)} for it; because it will surely{H935}{(H8800)} come{H935}{(H8799)}, it will not tarry{H309}{(H8762)}."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul{H5315} which is lifted up{H6075}{(H8795)} is not upright{H3474}{(H8804)} in him: but the just{H6662} shall live{H2421}{(H8799)} by his faith{H530}."
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yea also, because he transgresseth{H898}{(H8802)} by wine{H3196}, he is a proud{H3093} man{H1397}, neither keepeth at home{H5115}{(H8799)}, who enlargeth{H7337}{(H8689)} his desire{H5315} as hell{H7585}, and is as death{H4194}, and cannot be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)}, but gathereth{H622}{(H8799)} unto him all nations{H1471}, and heapeth{H6908}{(H8799)} unto him all people{H5971}:"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up{H5375}{(H8799)} a parable{H4912} against him, and a taunting{H4426} proverb{H2420} against him, and say{H559}{(H8799)}, Woe{H1945} to him that increaseth{H7235}{(H8688)} that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth{H3513}{(H8688)} himself with thick clay{H5671}!"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Shall they not rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} suddenly{H6621} that shall bite{H5391}{(H8802)} thee, and awake{H3364}{(H8799)} that shall vex{H2111}{(H8772)} thee, and thou shalt be for booties{H4933} unto them?"
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because thou hast spoiled{H7997}{(H8804)} many{H7227} nations{H1471}, all the remnant{H3499} of the people{H5971} shall spoil{H7997}{(H8799)} thee; because of men's{H120} blood{H1818}, and for the violence{H2555} of the land{H776}, of the city{H7151}, and of all that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe{H1945} to him that coveteth{H1214}{(H8802)} an evil{H7451} covetousness{H1215} to his house{H1004}, that he may set{H7760}{(H8800)} his nest{H7064} on high{H4791}, that he may be delivered{H5337}{(H8736)} from the power{H3709} of evil{H7451}!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"Thou hast consulted{H3289}{(H8804)} shame{H1322} to thy house{H1004} by cutting off{H7096}{(H8800)} many{H7227} people{H5971}, and hast sinned{H2398}{(H8802)} against thy soul{H5315}."
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone{H68} shall cry out{H2199}{(H8799)} of the wall{H7023}, and the beam out{H3714} of the timber{H6086} shall answer{H6030}{(H8799)} it."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe{H1945} to him that buildeth{H1129}{(H8802)} a town{H5892} with blood{H1818}, and stablisheth{H3559}{(H8790)} a city{H7151} by iniquity{H5766}!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, is it not of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} that the people{H5971} shall labour{H3021}{(H8799)} in the very{H1767} fire{H784}, and the people{H3816} shall weary{H3286}{(H8799)} themselves for very{H1767} vanity{H7385}?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth{H776} shall be filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with the knowledge{H3045}{(H8800)} of the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068}, as the waters{H4325} cover{H3680}{(H8762)} the sea{H3220}."
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe{H1945} unto him that giveth his neighbour{H7453} drink{H8248}{(H8688)}, that puttest{H5596}{(H8764)} thy bottle{H2573} to him, and makest him drunken{H7937}{(H8763)} also, that thou mayest look{H5027}{(H8687)} on their nakedness{H4589}!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"Thou art filled{H7646}{(H8804)} with shame{H7036} for glory{H3519}: drink{H8354}{(H8798)} thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered{H6188}{(H8734)}: the cup{H3563} of the LORD'S{H3068} right hand{H3225} shall be turned{H5437}{(H8735)} unto thee, and shameful spewing{H7022} shall be on thy glory{H3519}."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence{H2555} of Lebanon{H3844} shall cover{H3680}{(H8762)} thee, and the spoil{H7701} of beasts{H929}, which made them afraid{H2865}{(H8686)}, because of men's{H120} blood{H1818}, and for the violence{H2555} of the land{H776}, of the city{H7151}, and of all that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What profiteth{H3276}{(H8689)} the graven image{H6459} that the maker{H3335}{(H8802)} thereof hath graven{H6458}{(H8804)} it; the molten image{H4541}, and a teacher{H3384}{(H8688)} of lies{H8267}, that the maker{H3335}{(H8802)} of his work{H3336} trusteth{H982}{(H8804)} therein, to make{H6213}{(H8800)} dumb{H483} idols{H457}?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe{H1945} unto him that saith{H559}{(H8802)} to the wood{H6086}, Awake{H6974}{(H8685)}; to the dumb{H1748} stone{H68}, Arise{H5782}{(H8798)}, it shall teach{H3384}{(H8686)}! Behold, it is laid{H8610}{(H8803)} over with gold{H2091} and silver{H3701}, and there is no breath{H7307} at all in the midst{H7130} of it."
Habakkuk,2,20,But the LORD{H3068} is in his holy{H6944} temple{H1964}: let all the earth{H776} keep silence{H2013}{(H8761)} before{H6440} him.
Habakkuk,3,1,A prayer{H8605} of Habakkuk{H2265} the prophet{H5030} upon Shigionoth{H7692}.
Habakkuk,3,2,"O LORD{H3068}, I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} thy speech{H8088}, and was afraid{H3372}{(H8804)}: O LORD{H3068}, revive{H2421}{(H8761)} thy work{H6467} in the midst{H7130} of the years{H8141}, in the midst{H7130} of the years{H8141} make known{H3045}{(H8686)}; in wrath{H7267} remember{H2142}{(H8799)} mercy{H7355}{(H8763)}."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God{H433} came{H935}{(H8799)} from Teman{H8487}, and the Holy One{H6918} from mount{H2022} Paran{H6290}. Selah{H5542}. His glory{H1935} covered{H3680}{(H8765)} the heavens{H8064}, and the earth{H776} was full{H4390}{(H8804)} of his praise{H8416}."
Habakkuk,3,4,And his brightness{H5051} was as the light{H216}; he had horns{H7161} coming out of his hand{H3027}: and there was the hiding{H2253} of his power{H5797}.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before{H6440} him went{H3212}{(H8799)} the pestilence{H1698}, and burning coals{H7565} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} at his feet{H7272}."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood{H5975}{(H8804)}, and measured{H4128}{(H8787)} the earth{H776}: he beheld{H7200}{(H8804)}, and drove asunder{H5425}{(H8686)} the nations{H1471}; and the everlasting{H5703} mountains{H2042} were scattered{H6327}{(H8691)}, the perpetual{H5769} hills{H1389} did bow{H7817}{(H8804)}: his ways{H1979} are everlasting{H5769}."
Habakkuk,3,7,I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the tents{H168} of Cushan{H3572} in affliction{H205}: and the curtains{H3407} of the land{H776} of Midian{H4080} did tremble{H7264}{(H8799)}.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was the LORD{H3068} displeased{H2734}{(H8804)} against the rivers{H5104}? was thine anger{H639} against the rivers{H5104}? was thy wrath{H5678} against the sea{H3220}, that thou didst ride{H7392}{(H8799)} upon thine horses{H5483} and thy chariots{H4818} of salvation{H3444}?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"Thy bow{H7198} was made quite{H6181} naked{H5783}{(H8735)}, according to the oaths{H7621} of the tribes{H4294}, even thy word{H562}. Selah{H5542}. Thou didst cleave{H1234}{(H8762)} the earth{H776} with rivers{H5104}."
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains{H2022} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} thee, and they trembled{H2342}{(H8799)}: the overflowing{H2230} of the water{H4325} passed by{H5674}{(H8804)}: the deep{H8415} uttered{H5414}{(H8804)} his voice{H6963}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} his hands{H3027} on high{H7315}."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun{H8121} and moon{H3394} stood still{H5975}{(H8804)} in their habitation{H2073}: at the light{H216} of thine arrows{H2671} they went{H1980}{(H8762)}, and at the shining{H5051} of thy glittering{H1300} spear{H2595}."
Habakkuk,3,12,"Thou didst march through{H6805}{(H8799)} the land{H776} in indignation{H2195}, thou didst thresh{H1758}{(H8799)} the heathen{H1471} in anger{H639}."
Habakkuk,3,13,"Thou wentest forth{H3318}{(H8804)} for the salvation{H3468} of thy people{H5971}, even for salvation{H3468} with thine anointed{H4899}; thou woundedst{H4272}{(H8804)} the head{H7218} out of the house{H1004} of the wicked{H7563}, by discovering{H6168}{(H8763)} the foundation{H3247} unto the neck{H6677}. Selah{H5542}."
Habakkuk,3,14,Thou didst strike through{H5344}{(H8804)} with his staves{H4294} the head{H7218} of his villages{H6518}: they came out as a whirlwind{H5590}{(H8799)} to scatter{H6327}{(H8687)} me: their rejoicing{H5951} was as to devour{H398}{(H8800)} the poor{H6041} secretly{H4565}.
Habakkuk,3,15,"Thou didst walk{H1869}{(H8804)} through the sea{H3220} with thine horses{H5483}, through the heap{H2563} of great{H7227} waters{H4325}."
Habakkuk,3,16,"When I heard{H8085}{(H8804)}, my belly{H990} trembled{H7264}{(H8799)}; my lips{H8193} quivered{H6750}{(H8804)} at the voice{H6963}: rottenness{H7538} entered{H935}{(H8799)} into my bones{H6106}, and I trembled{H7264}{(H8799)} in myself, that I might rest{H5117}{(H8799)} in the day{H3117} of trouble{H6869}: when he cometh up{H5927}{(H8800)} unto the people{H5971}, he will invade them with his troops{H1464}{(H8799)}."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Although the fig tree{H8384} shall not blossom{H6524}{(H8799)}, neither shall fruit{H2981} be in the vines{H1612}; the labour{H4639} of the olive{H2132} shall fail{H3584}{(H8765)}, and the fields{H7709} shall yield{H6213}{(H8804)} no meat{H400}; the flock{H6629} shall be cut off{H1504}{(H8804)} from the fold{H4356}, and there shall be no herd{H1241} in the stalls{H7517}:"
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will rejoice{H5937}{(H8799)} in the LORD{H3068}, I will joy{H1523}{(H8799)} in the God{H430} of my salvation{H3468}."
Habakkuk,3,19,"The LORD{H3069} God{H136} is my strength{H2428}, and he will make{H7760}{(H8799)} my feet{H7272} like hinds{H355}' feet, and he will make me to walk{H1869}{(H8686)} upon mine high places{H1116}. To the chief singer{H5329}{(H8764)} on my stringed instruments{H5058}."
Zephaniah,1,1,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} which came unto Zephaniah{H6846} the son{H1121} of Cushi{H3570}, the son{H1121} of Gedaliah{H1436}, the son{H1121} of Amariah{H568}, the son{H1121} of Hizkiah{H2396}, in the days{H3117} of Josiah{H2977} the son{H1121} of Amon{H526}, king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I will utterly{H622}{(H8800)} consume{H5486}{(H8686)} all things from off the land{H6440}{H127}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Zephaniah,1,3,"I will consume{H5486}{(H8686)} man{H120} and beast{H929}; I will consume{H5486}{(H8686)} the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064}, and the fishes{H1709} of the sea{H3220}, and the stumblingblocks{H4384} with the wicked{H7563}; and I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} man{H120} from off{H6440} the land{H127}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Zephaniah,1,4,"I will also stretch out{H5186}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} upon Judah{H3063}, and upon all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}; and I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} the remnant{H7605} of Baal{H1168} from this place{H4725}, and the name{H8034} of the Chemarims{H3649} with the priests{H3548};"
Zephaniah,1,5,"And them that worship{H7812}{(H8693)} the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064} upon the housetops{H1406}; and them that worship{H7812}{(H8693)} and that swear{H7650}{(H8737)} by the LORD{H3068}, and that swear{H7650}{(H8737)} by Malcham{H4428};"
Zephaniah,1,6,"And them that are turned back{H5472}{(H8737)} from{H310} the LORD{H3068}; and those that have not sought{H1245}{(H8765)} the LORD{H3068}, nor enquired{H1875}{(H8804)} for him."
Zephaniah,1,7,"Hold thy peace{H2013}{(H8761)} at the presence{H6440} of the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}: for the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is at hand{H7138}: for the LORD{H3068} hath prepared{H3559}{(H8689)} a sacrifice{H2077}, he hath bid{H6942}{(H8689)} his guests{H7121}{(H8803)}."
Zephaniah,1,8,"And it shall come to pass in the day{H3117} of the LORD'S{H3068} sacrifice{H2077}, that I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} the princes{H8269}, and the king's{H4428} children{H1121}, and all such as are clothed{H3847}{(H8802)} with strange{H5237} apparel{H4403}."
Zephaniah,1,9,"In the same day{H3117} also will I punish{H6485}{(H8804)} all those that leap{H1801}{(H8802)} on the threshold{H4670}, which fill{H4390}{(H8764)} their masters{H113}' houses{H1004} with violence{H2555} and deceit{H4820}."
Zephaniah,1,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that there shall be the noise{H6963} of a cry{H6818} from the fish{H1709} gate{H8179}, and an howling{H3215} from the second{H4932}, and a great{H1419} crashing{H7667} from the hills{H1389}."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, ye inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Maktesh{H4389}, for all the merchant{H3667} people{H5971} are cut down{H1820}{(H8738)}; all they that bear{H5187} silver{H3701} are cut off{H3772}{(H8738)}."
Zephaniah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time{H6256}, that I will search{H2664}{(H8762)} Jerusalem{H3389} with candles{H5216}, and punish{H6485}{(H8804)} the men{H582} that are settled{H7087}{(H8802)} on their lees{H8105}: that say{H559}{(H8802)} in their heart{H3824}, The LORD{H3068} will not do good{H3190}{(H8686)}, neither will he do evil{H7489}{(H8686)}."
Zephaniah,1,13,"Therefore their goods{H2428} shall become a booty{H4933}, and their houses{H1004} a desolation{H8077}: they shall also build{H1129}{(H8804)} houses{H1004}, but not inhabit{H3427}{(H8799)} them; and they shall plant{H5193}{(H8804)} vineyards{H3754}, but not drink{H8354}{(H8799)} the wine{H3196} thereof."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great{H1419} day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is near{H7138}, it is near{H7138}, and hasteth{H4118} greatly{H3966}, even the voice{H6963} of the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068}: the mighty man{H1368} shall cry{H6873}{(H8802)} there bitterly{H4751}."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day{H3117} is a day{H3117} of wrath{H5678}, a day{H3117} of trouble{H6869} and distress{H4691}, a day{H3117} of wasteness{H7722} and desolation{H4875}, a day{H3117} of darkness{H2822} and gloominess{H653}, a day{H3117} of clouds{H6051} and thick darkness{H6205},"
Zephaniah,1,16,"A day{H3117} of the trumpet{H7782} and alarm{H8643} against the fenced{H1219}{(H8803)} cities{H5892}, and against the high{H1364} towers{H6438}."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress{H6887}{(H8689)} upon men{H120}, that they shall walk{H1980}{(H8804)} like blind men{H5787}, because they have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}: and their blood{H1818} shall be poured out{H8210}{(H8795)} as dust{H6083}, and their flesh{H3894} as the dung{H1561}."
Zephaniah,1,18,Neither their silver{H3701} nor their gold{H2091} shall be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} them in the day{H3117} of the LORD'S{H3068} wrath{H5678}; but the whole land{H776} shall be devoured{H398}{(H8735)} by the fire{H784} of his jealousy{H7068}: for he shall make{H6213}{(H8799)} even a speedy{H926}{(H8737)} riddance{H3617} of all them that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776}.
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together{H7197}{(H8703)}, yea, gather together{H7197}{(H8798)}, O nation{H1471} not desired{H3700}{(H8737)};"
Zephaniah,2,2,"Before the decree{H2706} bring forth{H3205}{(H8800)}, before the day{H3117} pass{H5674}{(H8804)} as the chaff{H4671}, before{H3808} the fierce{H2740} anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} come{H935}{(H8799)} upon you, before the day{H3117} of the LORD'S{H3068} anger{H639} come{H935}{(H8799)} upon you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek{H1245}{(H8761)} ye the LORD{H3068}, all ye meek{H6035} of the earth{H776}, which have wrought{H6466}{(H8804)} his judgment{H4941}; seek{H1245}{(H8761)} righteousness{H6664}, seek{H1245}{(H8761)} meekness{H6038}: it may be{H194} ye shall be hid{H5641}{(H8735)} in the day{H3117} of the LORD'S{H3068} anger{H639}."
Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza{H5804} shall be forsaken{H5800}{(H8803)}, and Ashkelon{H831} a desolation{H8077}: they shall drive out{H1644}{(H8762)} Ashdod{H795} at the noon day{H6672}, and Ekron{H6138} shall be rooted up{H6131}{(H8735)}."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe{H1945} unto the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the sea{H3220} coast{H2256}, the nation{H1471} of the Cherethites{H3774}! the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} is against you; O Canaan{H3667}, the land{H776} of the Philistines{H6430}, I will even destroy{H6}{(H8689)} thee, that there shall be no inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)}."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea{H3220} coast{H2256} shall be dwellings{H5116} and cottages{H3741} for shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}, and folds{H1448} for flocks{H6629}."
Zephaniah,2,7,"And the coast{H2256} shall be for the remnant{H7611} of the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}; they shall feed{H7462}{(H8799)} thereupon: in the houses{H1004} of Ashkelon{H831} shall they lie down{H7257}{(H8799)} in the evening{H6153}: for the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} shall visit{H6485}{(H8799)} them, and turn away{H7725}{(H8804)} their captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622}."
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the reproach{H2781} of Moab{H4124}, and the revilings{H1421} of the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, whereby they have reproached{H2778}{(H8765)} my people{H5971}, and magnified{H1431}{(H8686)} themselves against their border{H1366}."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Surely Moab{H4124} shall be as Sodom{H5467}, and the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983} as Gomorrah{H6017}, even the breeding{H4476} of nettles{H2738}, and saltpits{H4379}{H4417}, and a perpetual{H5704}{H5769} desolation{H8077}: the residue{H7611} of my people{H5971} shall spoil{H962}{(H8799)} them, and the remnant{H3499} of my people{H1471} shall possess{H5157}{(H8799)} them."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This shall they have for their pride{H1347}, because they have reproached{H2778}{(H8765)} and magnified{H1431}{(H8686)} themselves against the people{H5971} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Zephaniah,2,11,"The LORD{H3068} will be terrible{H3372}{(H8737)} unto them: for he will famish{H7329}{(H8804)} all the gods{H430} of the earth{H776}; and men shall worship{H7812}{(H8691)} him, every one{H376} from his place{H4725}, even all the isles{H339} of the heathen{H1471}."
Zephaniah,2,12,"Ye Ethiopians{H3569} also, ye{H1992} shall be slain{H2491} by my sword{H2719}."
Zephaniah,2,13,"And he will stretch out{H5186}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} against the north{H6828}, and destroy{H6}{(H8762)} Assyria{H804}; and will make{H7760}{(H8799)} Nineveh{H5210} a desolation{H8077}, and dry{H6723} like a wilderness{H4057}."
Zephaniah,2,14,"And flocks{H5739} shall lie down{H7257}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of her, all the beasts{H2416} of the nations{H1471}: both the cormorant{H6893} and the bittern{H7090} shall lodge{H3885}{(H8799)} in the upper lintels{H3730} of it; their voice{H6963} shall sing{H7891}{(H8787)} in the windows{H2474}; desolation{H2721} shall be in the thresholds{H5592}: for he shall uncover{H6168}{(H8765)} the cedar work{H731}."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the rejoicing{H5947} city{H5892} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} carelessly{H983}, that said{H559}{(H8802)} in her heart{H3824}, I am, and there is none beside{H657} me: how is she become a desolation{H8047}, a place for beasts{H2416} to lie down in{H4769}! every one that passeth by{H5674}{(H8802)} her shall hiss{H8319}{(H8799)}, and wag{H5128}{(H8686)} his hand{H3027}."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe{H1945} to her that is filthy{H4754}{(H8802)} and polluted{H1351}{(H8737)}, to the oppressing{H3238}{(H8802)} city{H5892}!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963}; she received{H3947}{(H8804)} not correction{H4148}; she trusted{H982}{(H8804)} not in the LORD{H3068}; she drew not near{H7126}{(H8804)} to her God{H430}.
Zephaniah,3,3,Her princes{H8269} within{H7130} her are roaring{H7580}{(H8802)} lions{H738}; her judges{H8199}{(H8802)} are evening{H6153} wolves{H2061}; they gnaw not the bones{H1633}{(H8804)} till the morrow{H1242}.
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets{H5030} are light{H6348}{(H8802)} and treacherous{H900} persons{H582}: her priests{H3548} have polluted{H2490}{(H8765)} the sanctuary{H6944}, they have done violence{H2554}{(H8804)} to the law{H8451}."
Zephaniah,3,5,"The just{H6662} LORD{H3068} is in the midst{H7130} thereof; he will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} iniquity{H5766}: every{H1242} morning{H1242} doth he bring{H5414}{(H8799)} his judgment{H4941} to light{H216}, he faileth{H5737}{(H8738)} not; but the unjust{H5767} knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} no shame{H1322}."
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} the nations{H1471}: their towers{H6438} are desolate{H8074}{(H8738)}; I made their streets{H2351} waste{H2717}{(H8689)}, that none passeth by{H5674}{(H8802)}: their cities{H5892} are destroyed{H6658}{(H8738)}, so that there is no man{H376}, that there is none inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)}."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Surely thou wilt fear{H3372}{(H8799)} me, thou wilt receive{H3947}{(H8799)} instruction{H4148}; so their dwelling{H4583} should not be cut off{H3772}{(H8735)}, howsoever{H834}{H3605} I punished{H6485}{(H8804)} them: but{H403} they rose early{H7925}{(H8689)}, and corrupted{H7843}{(H8689)} all their doings{H5949}."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait{H2442}{(H8761)} ye upon me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, until the day{H3117} that I rise up{H6965}{(H8800)} to the prey{H5706}: for my determination{H4941} is to gather{H622}{(H8800)} the nations{H1471}, that I may assemble{H6908}{(H8800)} the kingdoms{H4467}, to pour{H8210}{(H8800)} upon them mine indignation{H2195}, even all my fierce{H2740} anger{H639}: for all the earth{H776} shall be devoured{H398}{(H8735)} with the fire{H784} of my jealousy{H7068}."
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then will I turn{H2015}{(H8799)} to the people{H5971} a pure{H1305}{(H8803)} language{H8193}, that they may all call{H7121}{(H8800)} upon the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}, to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} him with one{H259} consent{H7926}."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond{H5676} the rivers{H5104} of Ethiopia{H3568} my suppliants{H6282}, even the daughter{H1323} of my dispersed{H6327}{(H8803)}, shall bring{H2986}{(H8686)} mine offering{H4503}."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day{H3117} shalt thou not be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)} for all thy doings{H5949}, wherein thou hast transgressed{H6586}{(H8804)} against me: for then I will take away{H5493}{(H8686)} out of the midst{H7130} of thee them that rejoice{H5947} in thy pride{H1346}, and thou shalt no more{H3254}{(H8686)} be haughty{H1361}{(H8800)} because of my holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}."
Zephaniah,3,12,"I will also leave{H7604}{(H8689)} in the midst{H7130} of thee an afflicted{H6041} and poor{H1800} people{H5971}, and they shall trust{H2620}{(H8804)} in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant{H7611} of Israel{H3478} shall not do{H6213}{(H8799)} iniquity{H5766}, nor speak{H1696}{(H8762)} lies{H3577}; neither shall a deceitful{H8649} tongue{H3956} be found{H4672}{(H8735)} in their mouth{H6310}: for they shall feed{H7462}{(H8799)} and lie down{H7257}{(H8804)}, and none shall make them afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}."
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing{H7442}{(H8798)}, O daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}; shout{H7321}{(H8685)}, O Israel{H3478}; be glad{H8055}{(H8798)} and rejoice{H5937}{(H8798)} with all the heart{H3820}, O daughter{H1323} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD{H3068} hath taken away{H5493}{(H8689)} thy judgments{H4941}, he hath cast out{H6437}{(H8765)} thine enemy{H341}{(H8802)}: the king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}, even the LORD{H3068}, is in the midst{H7130} of thee: thou shalt not see{H7200}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day{H3117} it shall be said{H559}{(H8735)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} thou not: and to Zion{H6726}, Let not thine hands{H3027} be slack{H7503}{(H8799)}."
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} in the midst{H7130} of thee is mighty{H1368}; he will save{H3467}{(H8686)}, he will rejoice{H7797}{(H8799)} over thee with joy{H8057}; he will rest{H2790}{(H8686)} in his love{H160}, he will joy{H1523}{(H8799)} over thee with singing{H7440}."
Zephaniah,3,18,"I will gather{H622}{(H8804)} them that are sorrowful{H3013}{(H8737)} for the solemn assembly{H4150}, who are of thee, to whom the reproach{H2781} of it was a burden{H4864}."
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time{H6256} I will undo{H6213}{(H8802)} all that afflict{H6031}{(H8764)} thee: and I will save{H3467}{(H8689)} her that halteth{H6760}{(H8802)}, and gather{H6908}{(H8762)} her that was driven out{H5080}{(H8737)}; and I will get{H7760}{(H8804)} them praise{H8416} and fame{H8034} in every land{H776} where they have been put to shame{H1322}."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time{H6256} will I bring{H935}{(H8686)} you again, even in the time{H6256} that I gather{H6908}{(H8763)} you: for I will make{H5414}{(H8799)} you a name{H8034} and a praise{H8416} among all people{H5971} of the earth{H776}, when I turn back{H7725}{(H8800)} your captivity{H7622} before your eyes{H5869}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Haggai,1,1,"In the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Darius{H1867} the king{H4428}, in the sixth{H8345} month{H2320}, in the first{H259} day{H3117} of the month{H2320}, came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} by{H3027} Haggai{H2292} the prophet{H5030} unto Zerubbabel{H2216} the son{H1121} of Shealtiel{H7597}, governor{H6346} of Judah{H3063}, and to Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Josedech{H3087}, the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,1,2,"Thus speaketh{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, This people{H5971} say{H559}{(H8804)}, The time{H6256} is not come{H935}{(H8800)}, the time{H6256} that the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004} should be built{H1129}{(H8736)}."
Haggai,1,3,"Then came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} by{H3027} Haggai{H2292} the prophet{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,1,4,"Is it time{H6256} for you, O ye, to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in your cieled{H5603}{(H8803)} houses{H1004}, and this house{H1004} lie waste{H2720}?"
Haggai,1,5,Now therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Consider{H7760}{(H8798)}{H3824} your ways{H1870}.
Haggai,1,6,"Ye have sown{H2232}{(H8804)} much{H7235}{(H8687)}, and bring{H935}{(H8687)} in little{H4592}; ye eat{H398}{(H8800)}, but ye have not enough{H7654}; ye drink{H8354}{(H8800)}, but ye are not filled with drink{H7937}{(H8800)}; ye clothe{H3847}{(H8800)} you, but there is none warm{H2527}; and he that earneth wages{H7936}{(H8693)} earneth wages{H7936}{(H8693)} to put it into a bag{H6872} with holes{H5344}{(H8803)}."
Haggai,1,7,Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Consider{H7760}{(H8798)}{H3824} your ways{H1870}.
Haggai,1,8,"Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} to the mountain{H2022}, and bring{H935}{(H8689)} wood{H6086}, and build{H1129}{(H8798)} the house{H1004}; and I will take pleasure{H7521}{(H8799)} in it, and I will be glorified{H3513}{(H8735)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Haggai,1,9,"Ye looked{H6437}{(H8800)} for much{H7235}{(H8687)}, and, lo, it came to little{H4592}; and when ye brought{H935}{(H8689)} it home{H1004}, I did blow{H5301}{(H8804)} upon it. Why? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}. Because{H3282} of mine house{H1004} that is waste{H2720}, and ye run{H7323}{(H8801)} every man{H376} unto his own house{H1004}."
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore the heaven{H8064} over you is stayed{H3607}{(H8804)} from dew{H2919}, and the earth{H776} is stayed{H3607}{(H8804)} from her fruit{H2981}."
Haggai,1,11,"And I called{H7121}{(H8799)} for a drought{H2721} upon the land{H776}, and upon the mountains{H2022}, and upon the corn{H1715}, and upon the new wine{H8492}, and upon the oil{H3323}, and upon that which the ground{H127} bringeth forth{H3318}{(H8686)}, and upon men{H120}, and upon cattle{H929}, and upon all the labour{H3018} of the hands{H3709}."
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel{H2216} the son{H1121} of Shealtiel{H7597}, and Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Josedech{H3087}, the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, with all the remnant{H7611} of the people{H5971}, obeyed{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and the words{H1697} of Haggai{H2292} the prophet{H5030}, as the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him, and the people{H5971} did fear{H3372}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
Haggai,1,13,"Then spake{H559}{(H8799)} Haggai{H2292} the LORD'S{H3068} messenger{H4397} in the LORD'S{H3068} message{H4400} unto the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I am with you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Haggai,1,14,"And the LORD{H3068} stirred up{H5782}{(H8686)} the spirit{H7307} of Zerubbabel{H2216} the son{H1121} of Shealtiel{H7597}, governor{H6346} of Judah{H3063}, and the spirit{H7307} of Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Josedech{H3087}, the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, and the spirit{H7307} of all the remnant{H7611} of the people{H5971}; and they came{H935}{(H8799)} and did{H6213}{(H8799)} work{H4399} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, their God{H430},"
Haggai,1,15,"In the four{H702} and twentieth{H6242} day{H3117} of the sixth{H8345} month{H2320}, in the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Darius{H1867} the king{H4428}."
Haggai,2,1,"In the seventh{H7637} month, in the one{H259} and twentieth{H6242} day of the month{H2320}, came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} by{H3027} the prophet{H5030} Haggai{H2292}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,2,2,"Speak{H559}{(H8798)} now to Zerubbabel{H2216} the son{H1121} of Shealtiel{H7597}, governor{H6346} of Judah{H3063}, and to Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Josedech{H3087}, the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, and to the residue{H7611} of the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,2,3,Who is left{H7604}{(H8737)} among you that saw{H7200}{(H8804)} this house{H1004} in her first{H7223} glory{H3519}? and how do ye see{H7200}{(H8802)} it now? is it not in your eyes{H5869} in comparison{H3644} of it as nothing?
Haggai,2,4,"Yet now be strong{H2388}{(H8798)}, O Zerubbabel{H2216}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; and be strong{H2388}{(H8798)}, O Joshua{H3091}, son{H1121} of Josedech{H3087}, the high{H1419} priest{H3548}; and be strong{H2388}{(H8798)}, all ye people{H5971} of the land{H776}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and work{H6213}{(H8798)}: for I am with you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}:"
Haggai,2,5,"According to the word{H1697} that I covenanted{H3772}{(H8804)} with you when ye came{H3318}{(H8800)} out of Egypt{H4714}, so my spirit{H7307} remaineth{H5975}{(H8802)} among{H8432} you: fear{H3372}{(H8799)} ye not."
Haggai,2,6,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Yet once{H259}, it is a little while{H4592}, and I will shake{H7493}{(H8688)} the heavens{H8064}, and the earth{H776}, and the sea{H3220}, and the dry{H2724} land;"
Haggai,2,7,"And I will shake{H7493}{(H8689)} all nations{H1471}, and the desire{H2532} of all nations{H1471} shall come{H935}{(H8804)}: and I will fill{H4390}{(H8765)} this house{H1004} with glory{H3519}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Haggai,2,8,"The silver{H3701} is mine, and the gold{H2091} is mine, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Haggai,2,9,"The glory{H3519} of this latter{H314} house{H1004} shall be greater than{H1419} of the former{H7223}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}: and in this place{H4725} will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} peace{H7965}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Haggai,2,10,"In the four{H702} and twentieth{H6242} day of the ninth{H8671} month, in the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Darius{H1867}, came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} by{H3027} Haggai{H2292} the prophet{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,2,11,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Ask{H7592}{(H8798)} now the priests{H3548} concerning the law{H8451}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,2,12,"If one{H376} bear{H5375}{(H8799)} holy{H6944} flesh{H1320} in the skirt{H3671} of his garment{H899}, and with his skirt{H3671} do touch{H5060}{(H8804)} bread{H3899}, or pottage{H5138}, or wine{H3196}, or oil{H8081}, or any meat{H3978}, shall it be holy{H6942}{(H8799)}? And the priests{H3548} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, No."
Haggai,2,13,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Haggai{H2292}, If one that is unclean{H2931} by a dead body{H5315} touch{H5060}{(H8799)} any of these, shall it be unclean{H2930}{(H8799)}? And the priests{H3548} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It shall be unclean{H2930}{(H8799)}."
Haggai,2,14,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Haggai{H2292}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, So is this people{H5971}, and so is this nation{H1471} before{H6440} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; and so is every work{H4639} of their hands{H3027}; and that which they offer{H7126}{(H8686)} there is unclean{H2931}."
Haggai,2,15,"And now, I pray you, consider{H7760}{(H8798)}{H3824} from this day{H3117} and upward{H4605}, from before{H2962} a stone{H68} was laid{H7760}{(H8800)} upon a stone{H68} in the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Haggai,2,16,"Since those days were, when one came{H935}{(H8804)} to an heap{H6194} of twenty{H6242} measures, there were but ten{H6235}: when one came{H935}{(H8804)} to the pressfat{H3342} for to draw out{H2834}{(H8800)} fifty{H2572} vessels out of the press{H6333}, there were but twenty{H6242}."
Haggai,2,17,"I smote{H5221}{(H8689)} you with blasting{H7711} and with mildew{H3420} and with hail{H1259} in all the labours{H4639} of your hands{H3027}; yet ye turned not to me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Haggai,2,18,"Consider{H7760}{(H8798)}{H3824} now from this day{H3117} and upward{H4605}, from the four{H702} and twentieth{H6242} day{H3117} of the ninth{H8671} month, even from the day{H3117} that the foundation{H3245}{(H8795)} of the LORD'S{H3068} temple{H1964} was laid, consider{H7760}{(H8798)}{H3824} it."
Haggai,2,19,"Is the seed{H2233} yet in the barn{H4035}? yea, as yet the vine{H1612}, and the fig tree{H8384}, and the pomegranate{H7416}, and the olive{H2132} tree{H6086}, hath not brought forth{H5375}{(H8804)}: from this day{H3117} will I bless{H1288}{(H8762)} you."
Haggai,2,20,"And again{H8145} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Haggai{H2292} in the four{H702} and twentieth{H6242} day of the month{H2320}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Haggai,2,21,"Speak{H559}{(H8798)} to Zerubbabel{H2216}, governor{H6346} of Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I will shake{H7493}{(H8688)} the heavens{H8064} and the earth{H776};"

Zechariah,1,6,"But my words{H1697} and my statutes{H2706}, which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} my servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, did they not take hold{H5381}{(H8689)} of your fathers{H1}? and they returned{H7725}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Like as the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} thought{H2161}{(H8804)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} unto us, according to our ways{H1870}, and according to our doings{H4611}, so hath he dealt{H6213}{(H8804)} with us."
Zechariah,1,7,"Upon the four{H702} and twentieth{H6242} day{H3117} of the eleventh{H6249}{H6240} month{H2320}, which is the month{H2320} Sebat{H7627}, in the second{H8147} year{H8141} of Darius{H1867}, came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto Zechariah{H2148}, the son{H1121} of Berechiah{H1296}, the son{H1121} of Iddo{H5714} the prophet{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,1,8,"I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} by night{H3915}, and behold a man{H376} riding{H7392}{(H8802)} upon a red{H122} horse{H5483}, and he stood{H5975}{(H8802)} among the myrtle trees{H1918} that were in the bottom{H4699}; and behind{H310} him were there red{H122} horses{H5483}, speckled{H8320}, and white{H3836}."
Zechariah,1,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, O my lord{H113}, what are these? And the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, I will shew{H7200}{(H8686)} thee what these be."
Zechariah,1,10,"And the man{H376} that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} among the myrtle trees{H1918} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, These are they whom the LORD{H3068} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} to walk{H1980}{(H8692)} to and fro through the earth{H776}."
Zechariah,1,11,"And they answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} among the myrtle trees{H1918}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, We have walked to and fro{H1980}{(H8694)} through the earth{H776}, and, behold, all the earth{H776} sitteth still{H3427}{(H8802)}, and is at rest{H8252}{(H8802)}."
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, how long wilt thou not have mercy{H7355}{(H8762)} on Jerusalem{H3389} and on the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, against which thou hast had indignation{H2194}{(H8804)} these threescore and ten{H7657} years{H8141}?"
Zechariah,1,13,And the LORD{H3068} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me with good{H2896} words{H1697} and comfortable{H5150} words{H1697}.
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel{H4397} that communed{H1696}{(H8802)} with me said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Cry{H7121}{(H8798)} thou, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; I am jealous{H7065}{(H8765)} for Jerusalem{H3389} and for Zion{H6726} with a great{H1419} jealousy{H7068}."
Zechariah,1,15,"And I am very{H1419} sore{H7110} displeased{H7107}{(H8804)} with the heathen{H1471} that are at ease{H7600}: for I was but a little{H4592} displeased{H7107}{(H8802)}, and they helped{H5826}{(H8804)} forward the affliction{H7451}."
Zechariah,1,16,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; I am returned{H7725}{(H8804)} to Jerusalem{H3389} with mercies{H7356}: my house{H1004} shall be built{H1129}{(H8735)} in it, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, and a line{H6957}{(H8675)}{H6961} shall be stretched forth{H5186}{(H8735)} upon Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zechariah,1,17,"Cry{H7121}{(H8798)} yet, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; My cities{H5892} through prosperity{H2896} shall yet be spread abroad{H6327}{(H8799)}; and the LORD{H3068} shall yet comfort{H5162}{(H8765)} Zion{H6726}, and shall yet choose{H977}{(H8804)} Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zechariah,1,18,"Then lifted I up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)}, and behold four{H702} horns{H7161}."
Zechariah,1,19,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me, What be these? And he answered{H559}{(H8799)} me, These are the horns{H7161} which have scattered{H2219}{(H8765)} Judah{H3063}, Israel{H3478}, and Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zechariah,1,20,And the LORD{H3068} shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} me four{H702} carpenters{H2796}.
Zechariah,1,21,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, What come{H935}{(H8802)} these to do{H6213}{(H8800)}? And he spake{H559}{(H8799)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, These are the horns{H7161} which have scattered{H2219}{(H8765)} Judah{H3063}, so that{H6310} no man{H376} did lift up{H5375}{(H8804)} his head{H7218}: but these are come{H935}{(H8799)} to fray{H2729}{(H8687)} them, to cast out{H3034}{(H8763)} the horns{H7161} of the Gentiles{H1471}, which lifted up{H5375}{(H8802)} their horn{H7161} over the land{H776} of Judah{H3063} to scatter{H2219}{(H8763)} it."
Zechariah,2,1,"I lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869} again, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and behold a man{H376} with a measuring{H4060} line{H2256} in his hand{H3027}."
Zechariah,2,2,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, Whither goest{H1980}{(H8802)} thou? And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, To measure{H4058}{(H8800)} Jerusalem{H3389}, to see{H7200}{(H8800)} what{H4100} is the breadth{H7341} thereof, and what is the length{H753} thereof."
Zechariah,2,3,"And, behold, the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me went forth{H3318}{(H8802)}, and another{H312} angel{H4397} went out{H3318}{(H8802)} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} him,"
Zechariah,2,4,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Run{H7323}{(H8798)}, speak{H1696}{(H8761)} to this{H1975} young man{H5288}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Jerusalem{H3389} shall be inhabited{H3427}{(H8799)} as towns without walls{H6519} for the multitude{H7230} of men{H120} and cattle{H929} therein{H8432}:"
Zechariah,2,5,"For I, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, will be unto her a wall{H2346} of fire{H784} round about{H5439}, and will be the glory{H3519} in the midst{H8432} of her."
Zechariah,2,6,"Ho{H1945}, ho{H1945}, come forth, and flee{H5127}{(H8798)} from the land{H776} of the north{H6828}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: for I have spread you abroad{H6566}{(H8765)} as the four{H702} winds{H7307} of the heaven{H8064}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,2,7,"Deliver{H4422}{(H8734)} thyself, O{H1945} Zion{H6726}, that dwellest{H3427}{(H8802)} with the daughter{H1323} of Babylon{H894}."
Zechariah,2,8,For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; After{H310} the glory{H3519} hath he sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me unto the nations{H1471} which spoiled{H7997}{(H8802)} you: for he that toucheth{H5060}{(H8802)} you toucheth{H5060}{(H8802)} the apple{H892} of his eye{H5869}.
Zechariah,2,9,"For, behold, I will shake{H5130}{(H8688)} mine hand{H3027} upon them, and they shall be a spoil{H7998} to their servants{H5647}{(H8802)}: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me."
Zechariah,2,10,"Sing{H7442}{(H8798)} and rejoice{H8055}{(H8798)}, O daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}: for, lo, I come{H935}{(H8802)}, and I will dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,2,11,"And many{H7227} nations{H1471} shall be joined{H3867}{(H8738)} to the LORD{H3068} in that day{H3117}, and shall be my people{H5971}: and I will dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of thee, and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me unto thee."
Zechariah,2,12,"And the LORD{H3068} shall inherit{H5157}{(H8804)} Judah{H3063} his portion{H2506} in the holy{H6944} land{H127}, and shall choose{H977}{(H8804)} Jerusalem{H3389} again."
Zechariah,2,13,"Be silent{H2013}{(H8761)}, O all flesh{H1320}, before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}: for he is raised up{H5782}{(H8738)} out of his holy{H6944} habitation{H4583}."
Zechariah,3,1,"And he shewed{H7200}{(H8686)} me Joshua{H3091} the high{H1419} priest{H3548} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068}, and Satan{H7854} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} at his right hand{H3225} to resist{H7853}{(H8800)} him."
Zechariah,3,2,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Satan{H7854}, The LORD{H3068} rebuke{H1605}{(H8799)} thee, O Satan{H7854}; even the LORD{H3068} that hath chosen{H977}{(H8802)} Jerusalem{H3389} rebuke{H1605}{(H8799)} thee: is not this a brand{H181} plucked{H5337}{(H8716)} out of the fire{H784}?"
Zechariah,3,3,"Now Joshua{H3091} was clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with filthy{H6674} garments{H899}, and stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the angel{H4397}."
Zechariah,3,4,"And he answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto those that stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take away{H5493}{(H8685)} the filthy{H6674} garments{H899} from him. And unto him he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have caused thine iniquity{H5771} to pass{H5674}{(H8689)} from thee, and I will clothe{H3847}{(H8687)} thee with change of raiment{H4254}."
Zechariah,3,5,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, Let them set{H7760}{(H8799)} a fair{H2889} mitre{H6797} upon his head{H7218}. So they set{H7760}{(H8799)} a fair{H2889} mitre{H6797} upon his head{H7218}, and clothed{H3847}{(H8686)} him with garments{H899}. And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} stood by{H5975}{(H8802)}."
Zechariah,3,6,"And the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} protested{H5749}{(H8686)} unto Joshua{H3091}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,3,7,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; If thou wilt walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in my ways{H1870}, and if thou wilt keep{H8104}{(H8799)} my charge{H4931}, then thou shalt also judge{H1777}{(H8799)} my house{H1004}, and shalt also keep{H8104}{(H8799)} my courts{H2691}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee places to walk{H4108}{(H8688)} among these that stand by{H5975}{(H8802)}."
Zechariah,3,8,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now, O Joshua{H3091} the high{H1419} priest{H3548}, thou, and thy fellows{H7453} that sit{H3427}{(H8802)} before{H6440} thee: for they are men{H582} wondered at{H4159}: for, behold, I will bring forth{H935}{(H8688)} my servant{H5650} the BRANCH{H6780}."
Zechariah,3,9,"For behold the stone{H68} that I have laid{H5414}{(H8804)} before{H6440} Joshua{H3091}; upon one{H259} stone{H68} shall be seven{H7651} eyes{H5869}: behold, I will engrave{H6605}{(H8764)} the graving{H6603} thereof, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, and I will remove{H4185}{(H8804)} the iniquity{H5771} of that land{H776} in one{H259} day{H3117}."
Zechariah,3,10,"In that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, shall ye call{H7121}{(H8799)} every man{H376} his neighbour{H7453} under the vine{H1612} and under the fig tree{H8384}."
Zechariah,4,1,"And the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me came again{H7725}{(H8799)}, and waked{H5782}{(H8686)} me, as a man{H376} that is wakened{H5782}{(H8735)} out of his sleep{H8142},"
Zechariah,4,2,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, What seest{H7200}{(H8802)} thou? And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, I have looked{H7200}{(H8804)}, and behold a candlestick{H4501} all of gold{H2091}, with a bowl{H1531} upon the top{H7218} of it, and his seven{H7651} lamps{H5216} thereon, and seven{H7651} pipes{H4166} to the seven{H7651} lamps{H5216}, which are upon the top{H7218} thereof:"
Zechariah,4,3,"And two{H8147} olive trees{H2132} by it, one{H259} upon the right{H3225} side of the bowl{H1543}, and the other{H259} upon the left{H8040} side thereof."
Zechariah,4,4,"So I answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and spake{H559}{(H8799)} to the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What are these, my lord{H113}?"
Zechariah,4,5,"Then the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou not what these be? And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, No, my lord{H113}."
Zechariah,4,6,"Then he answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, This is the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto Zerubbabel{H2216}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Not by might{H2428}, nor by power{H3581}, but by my spirit{H7307}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Zechariah,4,7,"Who art thou, O great{H1419} mountain{H2022}? before{H6440} Zerubbabel{H2216} thou shalt become a plain{H4334}: and he shall bring forth{H3318}{(H8689)} the headstone{H68}{H7222} thereof with shoutings{H8663}, crying, Grace{H2580}, grace{H2580} unto it."
Zechariah,4,8,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,4,9,The hands{H3027} of Zerubbabel{H2216} have laid the foundation{H3245}{(H8765)} of this house{H1004}; his hands{H3027} shall also finish{H1214}{(H8762)} it; and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me unto you.
Zechariah,4,10,"For who hath despised{H936}{(H8804)} the day{H3117} of small things{H6996}? for they shall rejoice{H8055}{(H8804)}, and shall see{H7200}{(H8804)} the plummet{H68}{H913} in the hand{H3027} of Zerubbabel{H2216} with those seven{H7651}; they are the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, which run to and fro{H7751}{(H8789)} through the whole earth{H776}."
Zechariah,4,11,"Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} I, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What are these two{H8147} olive trees{H2132} upon the right{H3225} side of the candlestick{H4501} and upon the left{H8040} side thereof?"
Zechariah,4,12,"And I answered{H6030}{(H8799)} again{H8145}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What be these two{H8147} olive{H2132} branches{H7641} which through{H3027} the two{H8147} golden{H2091} pipes{H6804} empty{H7324}{(H8688)} the golden{H2091} oil out of themselves?"
Zechariah,4,13,"And he answered{H559}{(H8799)} me and said{H559}{(H8800)}, Knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} thou not what these be? And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, No, my lord{H113}."
Zechariah,4,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he, These are the two{H8147} anointed{H3323} ones{H1121}, that stand{H5975}{(H8802)} by the Lord{H113} of the whole earth{H776}."
Zechariah,5,1,"Then I turned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and behold a flying{H5774}{(H8802)} roll{H4039}."
Zechariah,5,2,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, What seest{H7200}{(H8802)} thou? And I answered{H559}{(H8799)}, I see{H7200}{(H8802)} a flying{H5774}{(H8802)} roll{H4039}; the length{H753} thereof is twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} thereof ten{H6235} cubits{H520}."
Zechariah,5,3,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, This is the curse{H423} that goeth forth{H3318}{(H8802)} over the face{H6440} of the whole earth{H776}: for every one that stealeth{H1589}{(H8802)} shall be cut off{H5352}{(H8738)} as on this side according{H3644} to it; and every one that sweareth{H7650}{(H8737)} shall be cut off{H5352}{(H8738)} as on that side according{H3644} to it."
Zechariah,5,4,"I will bring it forth{H3318}{(H8689)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, and it shall enter{H935}{(H8804)} into the house{H1004} of the thief{H1590}, and into the house{H1004} of him that sweareth{H7650}{(H8737)} falsely{H8267} by my name{H8034}: and it shall remain{H3885}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of his house{H1004}, and shall consume{H3615}{(H8765)} it with the timber{H6086} thereof and the stones{H68} thereof."
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me went forth{H3318}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Lift up{H5375}{(H8798)} now thine eyes{H5869}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} what is this that goeth forth{H3318}{(H8802)}."
Zechariah,5,6,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)}, What is it? And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is an ephah{H374} that goeth forth{H3318}{(H8802)}. He said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover, This is their resemblance{H5869} through all the earth{H776}."
Zechariah,5,7,"And, behold, there was lifted up{H5375}{(H8738)} a talent{H3603} of lead{H5777}: and this is a{H259} woman{H802} that sitteth{H3427}{(H8802)} in the midst{H8432} of the ephah{H374}."
Zechariah,5,8,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, This is wickedness{H7564}. And he cast{H7993}{(H8686)} it into the midst{H8432} of the ephah{H374}; and he cast{H7993}{(H8686)} the weight{H68} of lead{H5777} upon the mouth{H6310} thereof."
Zechariah,5,9,"Then lifted I up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, there came out{H3318}{(H8802)} two{H8147} women{H802}, and the wind{H7307} was in their wings{H3671}; for they had{H2007} wings{H3671} like the wings{H3671} of a stork{H2624}: and they lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} the ephah{H374} between the earth{H776} and the heaven{H8064}."
Zechariah,5,10,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I to the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me, Whither do these bear{H3212}{(H8688)} the ephah{H374}?"
Zechariah,5,11,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, To build{H1129}{(H8800)} it an house{H1004} in the land{H776} of Shinar{H8152}: and it shall be established{H3559}{(H8717)}, and set{H3240}{(H8717)} there upon her own base{H4369}."
Zechariah,6,1,"And I turned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, there came{H3318} four{H702} chariots{H4818} out{H3318}{(H8802)} from between two{H8147} mountains{H2022}; and the mountains{H2022} were mountains{H2022} of brass{H5178}."
Zechariah,6,2,In the first{H7223} chariot{H4818} were red{H122} horses{H5483}; and in the second{H8145} chariot{H4818} black{H7838} horses{H5483};
Zechariah,6,3,And in the third{H7992} chariot{H4818} white{H3836} horses{H5483}; and in the fourth{H7243} chariot{H4818} grisled{H1261} and bay{H554} horses{H5483}.
Zechariah,6,4,"Then I answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the angel{H4397} that talked{H1696}{(H8802)} with me, What are these, my lord{H113}?"
Zechariah,6,5,"And the angel{H4397} answered{H6030}{(H8799)} and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, These are the four{H702} spirits{H7307} of the heavens{H8064}, which go forth{H3318}{(H8802)} from standing{H3320}{(H8692)} before the Lord{H113} of all the earth{H776}."
Zechariah,6,6,The black{H7838} horses{H5483} which are therein go forth{H3318}{(H8802)} into the north{H6828} country{H776}; and the white{H3836} go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} after{H310} them; and the grisled{H1261} go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} toward the south{H8486} country{H776}.
Zechariah,6,7,"And the bay{H554} went forth{H3318}{(H8804)}, and sought{H1245}{(H8762)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} that they might walk to and fro{H1980}{(H8692)} through the earth{H776}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Get you hence{H3212}{(H8798)}, walk to and fro{H1980}{(H8690)} through the earth{H776}. So they walked to and fro{H1980}{(H8691)} through the earth{H776}."
Zechariah,6,8,"Then cried{H2199}{(H8686)} he upon{H853} me, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold{H7200}{(H8798)}, these that go{H3318}{(H8802)} toward the north{H6828} country{H776} have quieted{H5117}{(H8689)} my spirit{H7307} in the north{H6828} country{H776}."
Zechariah,6,9,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,6,10,"Take{H3947}{(H8800)} of them of the captivity{H1473}, even of Heldai{H2469}, of Tobijah{H2900}, and of Jedaiah{H3048}, which are come{H935}{(H8804)} from Babylon{H894}, and come{H935}{(H8804)} thou the same day{H3117}, and go{H935}{(H8804)} into the house{H1004} of Josiah{H2977} the son{H1121} of Zephaniah{H6846};"
Zechariah,6,11,"Then take{H3947}{(H8804)} silver{H3701} and gold{H2091}, and make{H6213}{(H8804)} crowns{H5850}, and set{H7760}{(H8804)} them upon the head{H7218} of Joshua{H3091} the son{H1121} of Josedech{H3087}, the high{H1419} priest{H3548};"
Zechariah,6,12,"And speak{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus speaketh{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Behold the man{H376} whose name{H8034} is The BRANCH{H6780}; and he shall grow up{H6779}{(H8799)} out of his place, and he shall build{H1129}{(H8804)} the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Zechariah,6,13,"Even he shall build{H1129}{(H8799)} the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}; and he shall bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the glory{H1935}, and shall sit{H3427}{(H8804)} and rule{H4910}{(H8804)} upon his throne{H3678}; and he shall be a priest{H3548} upon his throne{H3678}: and the counsel{H6098} of peace{H7965} shall be between them both{H8147}."
Zechariah,6,14,"And the crowns{H5850} shall be to Helem{H2494}, and to Tobijah{H2900}, and to Jedaiah{H3048}, and to Hen{H2581} the son{H1121} of Zephaniah{H6846}, for a memorial{H2146} in the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,6,15,"And they that are far off{H7350} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} and build{H1129}{(H8804)} in the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently{H8085}{(H8800)} obey{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Zechariah,7,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth{H702} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Darius{H1867}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Zechariah{H2148} in the fourth{H702} day of the ninth{H8671} month{H2320}, even in Chisleu{H3691};"
Zechariah,7,2,"When they had sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto the house{H1004} of God{H410} Sherezer{H8272} and Regemmelech{H7278}, and their men{H582}, to pray{H2470}{(H8763)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068},"
Zechariah,7,3,"And to speak{H559}{(H8800)} unto the priests{H3548} which were in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, and to the prophets{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Should I weep{H1058}{(H8799)} in the fifth{H2549} month{H2320}, separating{H5144}{(H8736)} myself, as I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} these so many years{H8141}?"
Zechariah,7,4,"Then came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,7,5,"Speak{H559}{(H8798)} unto all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, and to the priests{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, When ye fasted{H6684}{(H8804)} and mourned{H5594}{(H8800)} in the fifth{H2549} and seventh{H7637} month, even those seventy{H7657} years{H8141}, did ye at all{H6684}{(H8800)} fast{H6684}{(H8804)} unto me, even to me?"
Zechariah,7,6,"And when ye did eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and when ye did drink{H8354}{(H8799)}, did not ye eat{H398}{(H8802)} for yourselves, and drink{H8354}{(H8802)} for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,"Should ye not hear the words{H1697} which the LORD{H3068} hath cried{H7121}{(H8804)} by{H3027} the former{H7223} prophets{H5030}, when Jerusalem{H3389} was inhabited{H3427}{(H8802)} and in prosperity{H7961}, and the cities{H5892} thereof round about her{H5439}, when men inhabited{H3427}{(H8802)} the south{H5045} and the plain{H8219}?"
Zechariah,7,8,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Zechariah{H2148}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,7,9,"Thus speaketh{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Execute{H8199}{(H8798)} true{H571} judgment{H4941}, and shew{H6213}{(H8798)} mercy{H2617} and compassions{H7356} every man{H376} to his brother{H251}:"
Zechariah,7,10,"And oppress{H6231}{(H8799)} not the widow{H490}, nor the fatherless{H3490}, the stranger{H1616}, nor the poor{H6041}; and let none of you imagine{H2803}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} against{H376} his brother{H251} in your heart{H3824}."
Zechariah,7,11,"But they refused{H3985}{(H8762)} to hearken{H7181}{(H8687)}, and pulled away{H5414}{(H8799)}{H5637}{(H8802)} the shoulder{H3802}, and stopped{H3513}{(H8689)} their ears{H241}, that they should not hear{H8085}{(H8800)}."
Zechariah,7,12,"Yea, they made{H7760}{(H8804)} their hearts{H3820} as an adamant stone{H8068}, lest they should hear{H8085}{(H8800)} the law{H8451}, and the words{H1697} which the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} in his spirit{H7307} by{H3027} the former{H7223} prophets{H5030}: therefore came a great{H1419} wrath{H7110} from the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Zechariah,7,13,"Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried{H7121}{(H8804)}, and they would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}; so they cried{H7121}{(H8799)}, and I would not hear{H8085}{(H8799)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}:"
Zechariah,7,14,"But I scattered them with a whirlwind{H5590}{(H8762)} among all the nations{H1471} whom they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not. Thus the land{H776} was desolate{H8074}{(H8738)} after{H310} them, that no man passed through{H5674}{(H8802)} nor returned{H7725}{(H8802)}: for they laid{H7760}{(H8799)} the pleasant{H2532} land{H776} desolate{H8047}."
Zechariah,8,1,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} came to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,8,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; I was jealous{H7065}{(H8765)} for Zion{H6726} with great{H1419} jealousy{H7068}, and I was jealous{H7065}{(H8765)} for her with great{H1419} fury{H2534}."
Zechariah,8,3,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; I am returned{H7725}{(H8804)} unto Zion{H6726}, and will dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of Jerusalem{H3389}: and Jerusalem{H3389} shall be called{H7121}{(H8738)} a city{H5892} of truth{H571}; and the mountain{H2022} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} the holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}."
Zechariah,8,4,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; There shall yet old men{H2205} and old women{H2205} dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in the streets{H7339} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and every man{H376} with his staff{H4938} in his hand{H3027} for very{H7230} age{H3117}."
Zechariah,8,5,And the streets{H7339} of the city{H5892} shall be full{H4390}{(H8735)} of boys{H3206} and girls{H3207} playing{H7832}{(H8764)} in the streets{H7339} thereof.
Zechariah,8,6,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; If it be marvellous{H6381}{(H8735)} in the eyes{H5869} of the remnant{H7611} of this people{H5971} in these days{H3117}, should it also be marvellous{H6381}{(H8735)} in mine eyes{H5869}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Zechariah,8,7,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Behold, I will save{H3467}{(H8688)} my people{H5971} from the east{H4217} country{H776}, and from the west{H3996}{H8121} country{H776};"
Zechariah,8,8,"And I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} them, and they shall dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of Jerusalem{H3389}: and they shall be my people{H5971}, and I will be their God{H430}, in truth{H571} and in righteousness{H6666}."
Zechariah,8,9,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Let your hands{H3027} be strong{H2388}{(H8799)}, ye that hear{H8085}{(H8802)} in these days{H3117} these words{H1697} by the mouth{H6310} of the prophets{H5030}, which were in the day{H3117} that the foundation{H3245} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} was laid{H3245}{(H8795)}, that the temple{H1964} might be built{H1129}{(H8736)}."
Zechariah,8,10,"For before{H6440} these days{H3117} there was{H1961}{(H8738)} no hire{H7939} for man{H120}, nor any hire{H7939} for beast{H929}; neither was there any peace{H7965} to him that went out{H3318}{(H8802)} or came in{H935}{(H8802)} because of the affliction{H6862}: for I set{H7971}{(H8762)} all men{H120} every one{H376} against his neighbour{H7453}."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I will not be unto the residue{H7611} of this people{H5971} as in the former{H7223} days{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Zechariah,8,12,"For the seed{H2233} shall be prosperous{H7965}; the vine{H1612} shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} her fruit{H6529}, and the ground{H776} shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} her increase{H2981}, and the heavens{H8064} shall give{H5414}{(H8799)} their dew{H2919}; and I will cause the remnant{H7611} of this people{H5971} to possess{H5157}{(H8689)} all these things."
Zechariah,8,13,"And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse{H7045} among the heathen{H1471}, O house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, and house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; so will I save{H3467}{(H8686)} you, and ye shall be a blessing{H1293}: fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not, but let your hands{H3027} be strong{H2388}{(H8799)}."
Zechariah,8,14,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; As I thought{H2161}{(H8804)} to punish{H7489}{(H8687)} you, when your fathers{H1} provoked me to wrath{H7107}{(H8687)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, and I repented{H5162}{(H8738)} not:"
Zechariah,8,15,So again{H7725}{(H8804)} have I thought{H2161}{(H8804)} in these days{H3117} to do well{H3190}{(H8687)} unto Jerusalem{H3389} and to the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}: fear{H3372}{(H8799)} ye not.
Zechariah,8,16,These are the things{H1697} that ye shall do{H6213}{(H8799)}; Speak{H1696}{(H8761)} ye every man{H376} the truth{H571} to his neighbour{H7453}; execute{H8199}{(H8798)} the judgment{H4941} of truth{H571} and peace{H7965} in your gates{H8179}:
Zechariah,8,17,"And let none{H376} of you imagine{H2803}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} in your hearts{H3824} against his neighbour{H7453}; and love{H157}{(H8799)} no false{H8267} oath{H7621}: for all these are things that I hate{H8130}{(H8804)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,8,18,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Zechariah,8,19,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; The fast{H6685} of the fourth{H7243} month, and the fast{H6685} of the fifth{H2549}, and the fast{H6685} of the seventh{H7637}, and the fast{H6685} of the tenth{H6224}, shall be to the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} joy{H8342} and gladness{H8057}, and cheerful{H2896} feasts{H4150}; therefore love{H157}{(H8798)} the truth{H571} and peace{H7965}."
Zechariah,8,20,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come{H935}{(H8799)} people{H5971}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of many{H7227} cities{H5892}:"
Zechariah,8,21,"And the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of one{H259} city shall go{H1980}{(H8804)} to another{H259}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let us go{H3212}{(H8799)} speedily{H1980}{(H8800)} to pray{H2470}{(H8763)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}: I will go{H3212}{(H8799)} also."
Zechariah,8,22,"Yea, many{H7227} people{H5971} and strong{H6099} nations{H1471} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} in Jerusalem{H3389}, and to pray{H2470}{(H8763)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,8,23,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; In those days{H3117} it shall come to pass, that ten{H6235} men{H582} shall take hold{H2388}{(H8686)} out of all languages{H3956} of the nations{H1471}, even shall take hold{H2388}{(H8689)} of the skirt{H3671} of him that is a Jew{H376}{H3064}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, We will go{H3212}{(H8799)} with you: for we have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that God{H430} is with you."
Zechariah,9,1,"The burden{H4853} of the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} in the land{H776} of Hadrach{H2317}, and Damascus{H1834} shall be the rest{H4496} thereof: when the eyes{H5869} of man{H120}, as of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}, shall be toward the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,9,2,"And Hamath{H2574} also shall border{H1379}{(H8799)} thereby; Tyrus{H6865}, and Zidon{H6721}, though it be very{H3966} wise{H2449}{(H8804)}."
Zechariah,9,3,"And Tyrus{H6865} did build{H1129}{(H8799)} herself a strong hold{H4692}, and heaped up{H6651}{(H8799)} silver{H3701} as the dust{H6083}, and fine gold{H2742} as the mire{H2916} of the streets{H2351}."
Zechariah,9,4,"Behold, the Lord{H136} will cast her out{H3423}{(H8686)}, and he will smite{H5221}{(H8689)} her power{H2428} in the sea{H3220}; and she shall be devoured{H398}{(H8735)} with fire{H784}."
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon{H831} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and fear{H3372}{(H8799)}; Gaza{H5804} also shall see it, and be very{H3966} sorrowful{H2342}{(H8799)}, and Ekron{H6138}; for her expectation{H4007} shall be ashamed{H3001}{(H8689)}; and the king{H4428} shall perish{H6}{(H8804)} from Gaza{H5804}, and Ashkelon{H831} shall not be inhabited{H3427}{(H8799)}."
Zechariah,9,6,"And a bastard{H4464} shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} in Ashdod{H795}, and I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} the pride{H1347} of the Philistines{H6430}."
Zechariah,9,7,"And I will take away{H5493}{(H8689)} his blood{H1818} out of his mouth{H6310}, and his abominations{H8251} from between his teeth{H8127}: but he that remaineth{H7604}{(H8738)}, even he, shall be for our God{H430}, and he shall be as a governor{H441} in Judah{H3063}, and Ekron{H6138} as a Jebusite{H2983}."
Zechariah,9,8,"And I will encamp{H2583}{(H8804)} about mine house{H1004} because of the army{H4675}, because of him that passeth by{H5674}{(H8802)}, and because of him that returneth{H7725}{(H8802)}: and no oppressor{H5065}{(H8802)} shall pass through{H5674}{(H8799)} them any more: for now have I seen{H7200}{(H8804)} with mine eyes{H5869}."
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice{H1523}{(H8798)} greatly{H3966}, O daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}; shout{H7321}{(H8685)}, O daughter{H1323} of Jerusalem{H3389}: behold, thy King{H4428} cometh{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee: he is just{H6662}, and having salvation{H3467}{(H8737)}; lowly{H6041}, and riding{H7392}{(H8802)} upon an ass{H2543}, and upon a colt{H5895} the foal{H1121} of an ass{H860}."
Zechariah,9,10,"And I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} the chariot{H7393} from Ephraim{H669}, and the horse{H5483} from Jerusalem{H3389}, and the battle{H4421} bow{H7198} shall be cut off{H3772}{(H8738)}: and he shall speak{H1696}{(H8765)} peace{H7965} unto the heathen{H1471}: and his dominion{H4915} shall be from sea{H3220} even to sea{H3220}, and from the river{H5104} even to the ends{H657} of the earth{H776}."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for thee also, by the blood{H1818} of thy covenant{H1285} I have sent forth{H7971}{(H8765)} thy prisoners{H615} out of the pit{H953} wherein is no water{H4325}."
Zechariah,9,12,"Turn{H7725}{(H8798)} you to the strong hold{H1225}, ye prisoners{H615} of hope{H8615}: even to day{H3117} do I declare{H5046}{(H8688)} that I will render{H7725}{(H8686)} double{H4932} unto thee;"
Zechariah,9,13,"When I have bent{H1869}{(H8804)} Judah{H3063} for me, filled{H4390}{(H8765)} the bow{H7198} with Ephraim{H669}, and raised up{H5782}{(H8790)} thy sons{H1121}, O Zion{H6726}, against thy sons{H1121}, O Greece{H3120}, and made{H7760}{(H8804)} thee as the sword{H2719} of a mighty man{H1368}."
Zechariah,9,14,"And the LORD{H3068} shall be seen{H7200}{(H8735)} over them, and his arrow{H2671} shall go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} as the lightning{H1300}: and the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} shall blow{H8628}{(H8799)} the trumpet{H7782}, and shall go{H1980}{(H8804)} with whirlwinds{H5591} of the south{H8486}."
Zechariah,9,15,"The LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} shall defend{H1598}{(H8686)} them; and they shall devour{H398}{(H8804)}, and subdue{H3533}{(H8804)} with sling{H7050} stones{H68}; and they shall drink{H8354}{(H8804)}, and make a noise{H1993}{(H8804)} as through wine{H3196}; and they shall be filled{H4390}{(H8804)} like bowls{H4219}, and as the corners{H2106} of the altar{H4196}."
Zechariah,9,16,"And the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} shall save{H3467}{(H8689)} them in that day{H3117} as the flock{H6629} of his people{H5971}: for they shall be as the stones{H68} of a crown{H5145}, lifted up as an ensign{H5264}{(H8706)} upon his land{H127}."
Zechariah,9,17,"For how great is his goodness{H2898}, and how great is his beauty{H3308}! corn{H1715} shall make the young men{H970} cheerful{H5107}{(H8766)}, and new wine{H8492} the maids{H1330}."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask{H7592}{(H8798)} ye of the LORD{H3068} rain{H4306} in the time{H6256} of the latter rain{H4456}; so the LORD{H3068} shall make{H6213}{(H8802)} bright clouds{H2385}, and give{H5414}{(H8799)} them showers{H1653} of rain{H4306}, to every one{H376} grass{H6212} in the field{H7704}."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the idols{H8655} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} vanity{H205}, and the diviners{H7080}{(H8802)} have seen{H2372}{(H8804)} a lie{H8267}, and have told{H1696}{(H8762)} false{H7723} dreams{H2472}; they comfort{H5162}{(H8762)} in vain{H1892}: therefore they went{H5265}{(H8804)} their way as a flock{H6629}, they were troubled{H6031}{(H8799)}, because there was no shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)}."
Zechariah,10,3,"Mine anger{H639} was kindled{H2734}{(H8804)} against the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}, and I punished{H6485}{(H8799)} the goats{H6260}: for the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} hath visited{H6485}{(H8804)} his flock{H5739} the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, and hath made{H7760}{(H8804)} them as his goodly{H1935} horse{H5483} in the battle{H4421}."
Zechariah,10,4,"Out of him came forth{H3318}{(H8799)} the corner{H6438}, out of him the nail{H3489}, out of him the battle{H4421} bow{H7198}, out of him every oppressor{H5065}{(H8802)} together{H3162}."
Zechariah,10,5,"And they shall be as mighty{H1368} men, which tread down{H947}{(H8802)} their enemies in the mire{H2916} of the streets{H2351} in the battle{H4421}: and they shall fight{H3898}{(H8738)}, because the LORD{H3068} is with them, and the riders{H7392}{(H8802)} on horses{H5483} shall be confounded{H3001}{(H8689)}."
Zechariah,10,6,"And I will strengthen{H1396}{(H8765)} the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, and I will save{H3467}{(H8686)} the house{H1004} of Joseph{H3130}, and I will bring them again to place{H3427}{(H8689)} them; for I have mercy{H7355}{(H8765)} upon them: and they shall be as though{H834} I had not cast them off{H2186}{(H8804)}: for I am the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, and will hear{H6030}{(H8799)} them."
Zechariah,10,7,"And they of Ephraim{H669} shall be like a mighty{H1368} man, and their heart{H3820} shall rejoice{H8055}{(H8804)} as through wine{H3196}: yea, their children{H1121} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and be glad{H8055}{(H8804)}; their heart{H3820} shall rejoice{H1523}{(H8799)} in the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,10,8,"I will hiss{H8319}{(H8799)} for them, and gather{H6908}{(H8762)} them; for I have redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} them: and they shall increase{H7235}{(H8804)} as they have increased{H7235}{(H8804)}."
Zechariah,10,9,"And I will sow{H2232}{(H8799)} them among the people{H5971}: and they shall remember{H2142}{(H8799)} me in far countries{H4801}; and they shall live{H2421}{(H8804)} with their children{H1121}, and turn again{H7725}{(H8804)}."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them again{H7725}{(H8689)} also out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and gather{H6908}{(H8762)} them out of Assyria{H804}; and I will bring{H935}{(H8686)} them into the land{H776} of Gilead{H1568} and Lebanon{H3844}; and place shall not be found{H4672}{(H8735)} for them."
Zechariah,10,11,"And he shall pass through{H5674}{(H8804)} the sea{H3220} with affliction{H6869}, and shall smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the waves{H1530} in the sea{H3220}, and all the deeps{H4688} of the river{H2975} shall dry up{H3001}{(H8689)}: and the pride{H1347} of Assyria{H804} shall be brought down{H3381}{(H8717)}, and the sceptre{H7626} of Egypt{H4714} shall depart away{H5493}{(H8799)}."
Zechariah,10,12,"And I will strengthen{H1396}{(H8765)} them in the LORD{H3068}; and they shall walk up and down{H1980}{(H8691)} in his name{H8034}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open{H6605}{(H8798)} thy doors{H1817}, O Lebanon{H3844}, that the fire{H784} may devour{H398}{(H8799)} thy cedars{H730}."
Zechariah,11,2,"Howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, fir tree{H1265}; for the cedar{H730} is fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}; because the mighty{H117} are spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}: howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, O ye oaks{H437} of Bashan{H1316}; for the forest{H3293} of the vintage{H1208}{(H8675)}{H1219}{(H8803)} is come down{H3381}{(H8804)}."
Zechariah,11,3,There is a voice{H6963} of the howling{H3215} of the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}; for their glory{H155} is spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}: a voice{H6963} of the roaring{H7581} of young lions{H3715}; for the pride{H1347} of Jordan{H3383} is spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}.
Zechariah,11,4,Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} my God{H430}; Feed{H7462}{(H8798)} the flock{H6629} of the slaughter{H2028};
Zechariah,11,5,"Whose possessors{H7069}{(H8802)} slay{H2026}{(H8799)} them, and hold themselves not guilty{H816}{(H8799)}: and they that sell{H4376}{(H8802)} them say{H559}{(H8799)}, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the LORD{H3068}; for I am rich{H6238}{(H8686)}: and their own shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} pity{H2550}{(H8799)} them not."
Zechariah,11,6,"For I will no more pity{H2550}{(H8799)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: but, lo, I will deliver{H4672}{(H8688)} the men{H120} every one{H376} into his neighbour's{H7453} hand{H3027}, and into the hand{H3027} of his king{H4428}: and they shall smite{H3807}{(H8765)} the land{H776}, and out of their hand{H3027} I will not deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} them."
Zechariah,11,7,"And I will feed{H7462}{(H8799)} the flock{H6629} of slaughter{H2028}, even you{H3651}, O poor{H6041} of the flock{H6629}. And I took{H3947}{(H8799)} unto me two{H8147} staves{H4731}; the one{H259} I called{H7121}{(H8804)} Beauty{H5278}, and the other{H259} I called{H7121}{(H8804)} Bands{H2254}{(H8802)}; and I fed{H7462}{(H8799)} the flock{H6629}."
Zechariah,11,8,"Three{H7969} shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} also I cut off{H3582}{(H8686)} in one{H259} month{H3391}; and my soul{H5315} lothed{H7114}{(H8799)} them, and their soul{H5315} also abhorred{H973}{(H8804)} me."
Zechariah,11,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, I will not feed{H7462}{(H8799)} you: that that dieth{H4191}{(H8801)}, let it die{H4191}{(H8799)}; and that that is to be cut off{H3582}{(H8737)}, let it be cut off{H3582}{(H8735)}; and let the rest{H7604}{(H8737)} eat{H398}{(H8799)} every one{H802} the flesh{H1320} of another{H7468}."
Zechariah,11,10,"And I took{H3947}{(H8799)} my staff{H4731}, even Beauty{H5278}, and cut it asunder{H1438}{(H8799)}, that I might break{H6565}{(H8687)} my covenant{H1285} which I had made{H3772}{(H8804)} with all the people{H5971}."
Zechariah,11,11,And it was broken{H6565}{(H8714)} in that day{H3117}: and so the poor{H6041} of the flock{H6629} that waited{H8104}{(H8802)} upon me knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that it was the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}.
Zechariah,11,12,"And I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, If ye think{H5869} good{H2896}, give{H3051}{(H8798)} me my price{H7939}; and if not, forbear{H2308}{(H8798)}. So they weighed{H8254}{(H8799)} for my price{H7939} thirty{H7970} pieces of silver{H3701}."
Zechariah,11,13,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Cast{H7993}{(H8685)} it unto the potter{H3335}{(H8802)}: a goodly{H145} price{H3366} that I was prised at{H3365}{(H8804)} of them. And I took{H3947}{(H8799)} the thirty{H7970} pieces of silver{H3701}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} them to the potter{H3335}{(H8802)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut asunder{H1438}{(H8799)} mine other{H8145} staff{H4731}, even Bands{H2254}{(H8802)}, that I might break{H6565}{(H8687)} the brotherhood{H264} between Judah{H3063} and Israel{H3478}."
Zechariah,11,15,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} unto thee yet the instruments{H3627} of a foolish{H196} shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)}."
Zechariah,11,16,"For, lo, I will raise up{H6965}{(H8688)} a shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)} in the land{H776}, which shall not visit{H6485}{(H8799)} those that be cut off{H3582}{(H8737)}, neither shall seek{H1245}{(H8762)} the young one{H5289}, nor heal{H7495}{(H8762)} that that is broken{H7665}{(H8737)}, nor feed{H3557}{(H8770)} that that standeth{H5324}{(H8737)} still: but he shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} the flesh{H1320} of the fat{H1277}, and tear{H6561} their claws{H6541} in pieces{H6561}{(H8762)}."
Zechariah,11,17,"Woe{H1945} to the idol{H457} shepherd{H7473} that leaveth{H5800}{(H8802)} the flock{H6629}! the sword{H2719} shall be upon his arm{H2220}, and upon his right{H3225} eye{H5869}: his arm{H2220} shall be clean{H3001}{(H8800)} dried up{H3001}{(H8799)}, and his right{H3225} eye{H5869} shall be utterly{H3543}{(H8800)} darkened{H3543}{(H8799)}."
Zechariah,12,1,"The burden{H4853} of the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} for Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, which stretcheth{H5186}{(H8802)} forth the heavens{H8064}, and layeth the foundation{H3245}{(H8801)} of the earth{H776}, and formeth{H3335}{(H8802)} the spirit{H7307} of man{H120} within{H7130} him."
Zechariah,12,2,"Behold, I will make{H7760}{(H8802)} Jerusalem{H3389} a cup{H5592} of trembling{H7478} unto all the people{H5971} round about{H5439}, when they shall be in the siege{H4692} both against Judah{H3063} and against Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zechariah,12,3,"And in that day{H3117} will I make{H7760}{(H8799)} Jerusalem{H3389} a burdensome{H4614} stone{H68} for all people{H5971}: all that burden{H6006}{(H8802)} themselves with it shall be cut in pieces{H8295}{(H8800)}{H8295}{(H8735)}, though all the people{H1471} of the earth{H776} be gathered together{H622}{(H8738)} against it."
Zechariah,12,4,"In that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, I will smite{H5221}{(H8686)} every horse{H5483} with astonishment{H8541}, and his rider{H7392}{(H8802)} with madness{H7697}: and I will open{H6491}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869} upon the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, and will smite{H5221}{(H8686)} every horse{H5483} of the people{H5971} with blindness{H5788}."
Zechariah,12,5,"And the governors{H441} of Judah{H3063} shall say{H559}{(H8804)} in their heart{H3820}, The inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} shall be my strength{H556} in the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} their God{H430}."
Zechariah,12,6,"In that day{H3117} will I make{H7760}{(H8799)} the governors{H441} of Judah{H3063} like an hearth{H3595} of fire{H784} among the wood{H6086}, and like a torch{H3940} of fire{H784} in a sheaf{H5995}; and they shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} all the people{H5971} round about{H5439}, on the right hand{H3225} and on the left{H8040}: and Jerusalem{H3389} shall be inhabited{H3427}{(H8804)} again in her own place, even in Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zechariah,12,7,"The LORD{H3068} also shall save{H3467}{(H8689)} the tents{H168} of Judah{H3063} first{H7223}, that the glory{H8597} of the house{H1004} of David{H1732} and the glory{H8597} of the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} do not magnify{H1431}{(H8799)} themselves against Judah{H3063}."
Zechariah,12,8,"In that day{H3117} shall the LORD{H3068} defend{H1598}{(H8686)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}; and he that is feeble{H3782}{(H8737)} among them at that day{H3117} shall be as David{H1732}; and the house{H1004} of David{H1732} shall be as God{H430}, as the angel{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} before{H6440} them."
Zechariah,12,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day{H3117}, that I will seek{H1245}{(H8762)} to destroy{H8045}{(H8687)} all the nations{H1471} that come{H935}{(H8802)} against Jerusalem{H3389}."
Zechariah,12,10,"And I will pour{H8210}{(H8804)} upon the house{H1004} of David{H1732}, and upon the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, the spirit{H7307} of grace{H2580} and of supplications{H8469}: and they shall look{H5027}{(H8689)} upon me whom they have pierced{H1856}{(H8804)}, and they shall mourn{H4553} for him, as one mourneth{H5594}{(H8804)} for his only{H3173} son, and shall be in bitterness{H4843}{(H8687)} for him, as one that is in bitterness{H4843}{(H8687)} for his firstborn{H1060}."
Zechariah,12,11,"In that day{H3117} shall there be a great{H1431}{(H8799)} mourning{H4553} in Jerusalem{H3389}, as the mourning{H4553} of Hadadrimmon{H1910} in the valley{H1237} of Megiddon{H4023}."

Zechariah,13,2,"And it shall come to pass in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, that I will cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} the names{H8034} of the idols{H6091} out of the land{H776}, and they shall no more be remembered{H2142}{(H8735)}: and also I will cause the prophets{H5030} and the unclean{H2932} spirit{H7307} to pass{H5674}{(H8686)} out of the land{H776}."

Malachi,2,4,"And ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I have sent{H7971}{(H8765)} this commandment{H4687} unto you, that my covenant{H1285} might be with Levi{H3878}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,2,5,"My covenant{H1285} was with him of life{H2416} and peace{H7965}; and I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them to him for the fear{H4172} wherewith he feared{H3372}{(H8799)} me, and was afraid{H2865}{(H8738)} before{H6440} my name{H8034}."
Malachi,2,6,"The law{H8451} of truth{H571} was in his mouth{H6310}, and iniquity{H5766} was not found{H4672}{(H8738)} in his lips{H8193}: he walked{H1980}{(H8804)} with me in peace{H7965} and equity{H4334}, and did turn{H7725} many{H7227} away{H7725}{(H8689)} from iniquity{H5771}."
Malachi,2,7,"For the priest's{H3548} lips{H8193} should keep{H8104}{(H8799)} knowledge{H1847}, and they should seek{H1245}{(H8762)} the law{H8451} at his mouth{H6310}: for he is the messenger{H4397} of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,2,8,"But ye are departed{H5493}{(H8804)} out of the way{H1870}; ye have caused many{H7227} to stumble{H3782}{(H8689)} at the law{H8451}; ye have corrupted{H7843}{(H8765)} the covenant{H1285} of Levi{H3878}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,2,9,"Therefore have I also made{H5414}{(H8804)} you contemptible{H959}{(H8737)} and base{H8217} before all the people{H5971}, according{H6310} as ye have not kept{H8104}{(H8802)} my ways{H1870}, but have been partial{H5375}{(H8802)}{H6440} in the law{H8451}."
Malachi,2,10,"Have we not all one{H259} father{H1}? hath not one{H259} God{H410} created{H1254}{(H8804)} us? why do we deal treacherously{H898}{(H8799)} every man{H376} against his brother{H251}, by profaning{H2490}{(H8763)} the covenant{H1285} of our fathers{H1}?"
Malachi,2,11,"Judah{H3063} hath dealt treacherously{H898}{(H8804)}, and an abomination{H8441} is committed{H6213}{(H8738)} in Israel{H3478} and in Jerusalem{H3389}; for Judah{H3063} hath profaned{H2490}{(H8765)} the holiness{H6944} of the LORD{H3068} which he loved{H157}{(H8804)}, and hath married{H1166}{(H8804)} the daughter{H1323} of a strange{H5236} god{H410}."
Malachi,2,12,"The LORD{H3068} will cut off{H3772}{(H8686)} the man{H376} that doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} this, the master{H5782}{(H8802)} and the scholar{H6030}{(H8802)}, out of the tabernacles{H168} of Jacob{H3290}, and him that offereth{H5066}{(H8688)} an offering{H4503} unto the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,2,13,"And this have ye done{H6213}{(H8799)} again{H8145}, covering{H3680}{(H8763)} the altar{H4196} of the LORD{H3068} with tears{H1832}, with weeping{H1065}, and with crying out{H603}, insomuch that he regardeth{H6437}{(H8800)} not the offering{H4503} any more, or receiveth{H3947}{(H8800)} it with good will{H7522} at your hand{H3027}."
Malachi,2,14,"Yet ye say{H559}{(H8804)}, Wherefore{H4100}? Because the LORD{H3068} hath been witness{H5749}{(H8689)} between thee and the wife{H802} of thy youth{H5271}, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously{H898}{(H8804)}: yet is she thy companion{H2278}, and the wife{H802} of thy covenant{H1285}."
Malachi,2,15,"And did not he make{H6213}{(H8804)} one{H259}? Yet had he the residue{H7605} of the spirit{H7307}. And wherefore one{H259}? That he might seek{H1245}{(H8764)} a godly{H430} seed{H2233}. Therefore take heed{H8104}{(H8738)} to your spirit{H7307}, and let none deal treacherously{H898}{(H8799)} against the wife{H802} of his youth{H5271}."
Malachi,2,16,"For the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} that he hateth{H8130}{(H8804)} putting away{H7971}{(H8763)}: for one covereth{H3680}{(H8765)} violence{H2555} with his garment{H3830}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}: therefore take heed{H8104}{(H8738)} to your spirit{H7307}, that ye deal not treacherously{H898}{(H8799)}."
Malachi,2,17,"Ye have wearied{H3021}{(H8689)} the LORD{H3068} with your words{H1697}. Yet ye say{H559}{(H8804)}, Wherein have we wearied{H3021}{(H8689)} him? When ye say{H559}{(H8800)}, Every one that doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} evil{H7451} is good{H2896} in the sight{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, and he delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} in them; or, Where is the God{H430} of judgment{H4941}?"
Malachi,3,1,"Behold, I will send{H7971}{(H8802)} my messenger{H4397}, and he shall prepare{H6437}{(H8765)} the way{H1870} before{H6440} me: and the Lord{H113}, whom ye seek{H1245}{(H8764)}, shall suddenly{H6597} come{H935}{(H8799)} to his temple{H1964}, even the messenger{H4397} of the covenant{H1285}, whom ye delight{H2655} in: behold, he shall come{H935}{(H8804)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,3,2,"But who may abide{H3557}{(H8772)} the day{H3117} of his coming{H935}{(H8800)}? and who shall stand{H5975}{(H8802)} when he appeareth{H7200}{(H8736)}? for he is like a refiner's{H6884}{(H8764)} fire{H784}, and like fullers{H3526}{(H8764)}' soap{H1287}:"
Malachi,3,3,"And he shall sit{H3427}{(H8804)} as a refiner{H6884}{(H8764)} and purifier{H2891}{(H8764)} of silver{H3701}: and he shall purify{H2891}{(H8765)} the sons{H1121} of Levi{H3878}, and purge{H2212}{(H8765)} them as gold{H2091} and silver{H3701}, that they may offer{H5066}{(H8688)} unto the LORD{H3068} an offering{H4503} in righteousness{H6666}."
Malachi,3,4,"Then shall the offering{H4503} of Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389} be pleasant{H6149}{(H8804)} unto the LORD{H3068}, as in the days{H3117} of old{H5769}, and as in former{H6931} years{H8141}."
Malachi,3,5,"And I will come near{H7126}{(H8804)} to you to judgment{H4941}; and I will be a swift{H4116}{(H8764)} witness{H5707} against the sorcerers{H3784}{(H8764)}, and against the adulterers{H5003}{(H8764)}, and against false{H8267} swearers{H7650}{(H8737)}, and against those that oppress{H6231}{(H8802)} the hireling{H7916} in his wages{H7939}, the widow{H490}, and the fatherless{H3490}, and that turn aside{H5186}{(H8688)} the stranger{H1616} from his right, and fear{H3372}{(H8804)} not me, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,3,6,"For I am the LORD{H3068}, I change{H8138}{(H8804)} not; therefore ye sons{H1121} of Jacob{H3290} are not consumed{H3615}{(H8804)}."
Malachi,3,7,"Even from the days{H3117} of your fathers{H1} ye are gone away{H5493}{(H8804)} from mine ordinances{H2706}, and have not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} them. Return{H7725}{(H8798)} unto me, and I will return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto you, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}. But ye said{H559}{(H8804)}, Wherein shall we return{H7725}{(H8799)}?"
Malachi,3,8,"Will a man{H120} rob{H6906}{(H8799)} God{H430}? Yet ye have robbed{H6906}{(H8802)} me. But ye say{H559}{(H8804)}, Wherein have we robbed{H6906}{(H8804)} thee? In tithes{H4643} and offerings{H8641}."
Malachi,3,9,"Ye are cursed{H779}{(H8737)} with a curse{H3994}: for ye have robbed{H6906}{(H8802)} me, even this whole nation{H1471}."
Malachi,3,10,"Bring{H935}{(H8685)} ye all the tithes{H4643} into the storehouse{H214}, that there may be meat{H2964} in mine house{H1004}, and prove{H974}{(H8798)} me now herewith{H2063}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, if I will not open{H6605}{(H8799)} you the windows{H699} of heaven{H8064}, and pour you out{H7324}{(H8689)} a blessing{H1293}, that there shall not be room enough{H1767} to receive it."
Malachi,3,11,"And I will rebuke{H1605}{(H8804)} the devourer{H398}{(H8802)} for your sakes, and he shall not destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} the fruits{H6529} of your ground{H127}; neither shall your vine{H1612} cast her fruit{H7921}{(H8762)} before the time in the field{H7704}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,3,12,"And all nations{H1471} shall call you blessed{H833}{(H8765)}: for ye shall be a delightsome{H2656} land{H776}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,3,13,"Your words{H1697} have been stout{H2388}{(H8804)} against me, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}. Yet ye say{H559}{(H8804)}, What have we spoken{H1696}{(H8738)} so much against thee?"
Malachi,3,14,"Ye have said{H559}{(H8804)}, It is vain{H7723} to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} God{H430}: and what profit{H1215} is it that we have kept{H8104}{(H8804)} his ordinance{H4931}, and that we have walked{H1980}{(H8804)} mournfully{H6941} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}?"
Malachi,3,15,"And now we call{H833} the proud{H2086} happy{H833}{(H8764)}; yea, they that work{H6213}{(H8802)} wickedness{H7564} are set up{H1129}{(H8738)}; yea, they that tempt{H974}{(H8804)} God{H430} are even delivered{H4422}{(H8735)}."
Malachi,3,16,"Then they that feared{H3373} the LORD{H3068} spake often{H1696}{(H8738)} one{H376} to another{H7453}: and the LORD{H3068} hearkened{H7181}{(H8686)}, and heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it, and a book{H5612} of remembrance{H2146} was written{H3789}{(H8735)} before{H6440} him for them that feared{H3373} the LORD{H3068}, and that thought{H2803}{(H8802)} upon his name{H8034}."
Malachi,3,17,"And they shall be mine, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, in that day{H3117} when I make up{H6213}{(H8802)} my jewels{H5459}; and I will spare{H2550}{(H8804)} them, as a man{H376} spareth{H2550}{(H8799)} his own son{H1121} that serveth{H5647}{(H8802)} him."
Malachi,3,18,"Then shall ye return{H7725}{(H8804)}, and discern{H7200}{(H8804)} between the righteous{H6662} and the wicked{H7563}, between him that serveth{H5647}{(H8802)} God{H430} and him that serveth{H5647}{(H8804)} him not."
Malachi,4,1,"For, behold, the day{H3117} cometh{H935}{(H8802)}, that shall burn{H1197}{(H8802)} as an oven{H8574}; and all the proud{H2086}, yea, and all that do{H6213}{(H8802)} wickedly{H7564}, shall be stubble{H7179}: and the day{H3117} that cometh{H935}{(H8802)} shall burn them up{H3857}{(H8765)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, that it shall leave{H5800}{(H8799)} them neither root{H8328} nor branch{H6057}."
Malachi,4,2,"But unto you that fear{H3373} my name{H8034} shall the Sun{H8121} of righteousness{H6666} arise{H2224}{(H8804)} with healing{H4832} in his wings{H3671}; and ye shall go forth{H3318}{(H8804)}, and grow up{H6335}{(H8804)} as calves{H5695} of the stall{H4770}."
Malachi,4,3,"And ye shall tread down{H6072}{(H8804)} the wicked{H7563}; for they shall be ashes{H665} under the soles{H3709} of your feet{H7272} in the day{H3117} that I shall do{H6213}{(H8802)} this, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Malachi,4,4,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} ye the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872} my servant{H5650}, which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} unto him in Horeb{H2722} for all Israel{H3478}, with the statutes{H2706} and judgments{H4941}."
Malachi,4,5,"Behold, I will send{H7971}{(H8802)} you Elijah{H452} the prophet{H5030} before{H6440} the coming{H935}{(H8800)} of the great{H1419} and dreadful{H3372}{(H8737)} day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Malachi,4,6,"And he shall turn{H7725}{(H8689)} the heart{H3820} of the fathers{H1} to the children{H1121}, and the heart{H3820} of the children{H1121} to their fathers{H1}, lest I come{H935}{(H8799)} and smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the earth{H776} with a curse{H2764}."

Matthew,3,14,"But{G1161} John{G2491} forbad{G1254}{(G5707)} him, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, I{G1473} have{G2192}{(G5719)} need{G5532} to be baptized{G907}{(G5683)} of{G5259} thee{G4675}, and{G2532} comest{G2064}{(G5736)} thou{G4771} to{G4314} me{G3165}?"
Matthew,3,15,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Suffer{G863}{(G5628)} it to be so now{G737}: for{G1063} thus{G3779} it becometh{G4241}{(G5723)}{G2076}{(G5748)} us{G2254} to fulfil{G4137}{(G5658)} all{G3956} righteousness{G1343}.

Matthew,9,16,"{G1161} No man{G3762} putteth{G1911}{(G5719)} a piece{G1915} of new{G46} cloth{G4470} unto{G1909} an old{G3820} garment{G2440}, for{G1063} that which is put in to fill it up{G4138} taketh{G142}{(G5719)}{G846} from{G575} the garment{G2440}, and{G2532} the rent{G4978} is made{G1096}{(G5736)} worse{G5501}."
Matthew,9,17,"Neither{G3761} do men put{G906}{(G5719)} new{G3501} wine{G3631} into{G1519} old{G3820} bottles{G779}: else{G1490} the bottles{G779} break{G4486}{(G5743)}, and{G2532} the wine{G3631} runneth out{G1632}{(G5743)}, and{G2532} the bottles{G779} perish{G622}{(G5698)}: but{G235} they put{G906}{(G5719)} new{G3501} wine{G3631} into{G1519} new{G2537} bottles{G779}, and{G2532} both{G297} are preserved{G4933}{(G5743)}."
Matthew,9,18,"While he{G846} spake{G2980}{(G5723)} these things{G5023} unto them{G846}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, there came{G2064}{(G5631)} a certain{G1520} ruler{G758}, and worshipped{G4352}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} My{G3450} daughter{G2364} is even now{G737} dead{G5053}{(G5656)}: but{G235} come{G2064}{(G5631)} and lay{G2007}{(G5628)} thy{G4675} hand{G5495} upon{G1909} her{G846}, and{G2532} she shall live{G2198}{(G5695)}."
Matthew,9,19,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} arose{G1453}{(G5685)}, and followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} so did his{G846} disciples{G3101}."
Matthew,9,20,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, a woman{G1135}, which was diseased with an issue of blood{G131}{(G5723)} twelve{G1427} years{G2094}, came{G4334}{(G5631)} behind{G3693} him, and touched{G680}{(G5662)} the hem{G2899} of his{G846} garment{G2440}:"
Matthew,9,21,"For{G1063} she said{G3004}{(G5707)} within{G1722} herself{G1438}, If{G1437} I may{G680} but{G3440} touch{G680}{(G5672)} his{G846} garment{G2440}, I shall be whole{G4982}{(G5701)}."
Matthew,9,22,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} turned him about{G1994}{(G5651)}, and{G2532} when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} her{G846}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Daughter{G2364}, be of good comfort{G2293}{(G5720)}; thy{G4675} faith{G4102} hath made{G4982} thee{G4571} whole{G4982}{(G5758)}. And{G2532} the woman{G1135} was made whole{G4982}{(G5681)} from{G575} that{G1565} hour{G5610}."
Matthew,9,23,"And{G2532} when Jesus{G2424} came{G2064}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the ruler's{G758} house{G3614}, and{G2532} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} the minstrels{G834} and{G2532} the people{G3793} making a noise{G2350}{(G5746)},"
Matthew,9,24,"He said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Give place{G402}{(G5720)}: for{G1063} the maid{G2877} is{G599} not{G3756} dead{G599}{(G5627)}, but{G235} sleepeth{G2518}{(G5719)}. And{G2532} they laughed{G2606} him{G846} to scorn{G2606}{(G5707)}."
Matthew,9,25,"But{G1161} when{G3753} the people{G3793} were put forth{G1544}{(G5681)}, he went in{G1525}{(G5631)}, and took{G2902}{(G5656)} her{G846} by the hand{G5495}, and{G2532} the maid{G2877} arose{G1453}{(G5681)}."
Matthew,9,26,And{G2532} the fame{G5345} hereof{G3778} went abroad{G1831}{(G5627)} into{G1519} all{G3650} that{G1565} land{G1093}.
Matthew,9,27,"And{G2532} when Jesus{G2424} departed{G3855}{(G5723)} thence{G1564}, two{G1417} blind men{G5185} followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}, crying{G2896}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Thou Son{G5207} of David{G1138}, have mercy{G1653}{(G5657)} on us{G2248}."
Matthew,9,28,"And{G1161} when he was come{G2064}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the house{G3614}, the blind men{G5185} came{G4334}{(G5656)} to him{G846}: and{G2532} Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Believe ye{G4100}{(G5720)} that{G3754} I am able{G1410}{(G5736)} to do{G4160}{(G5658)} this{G5124}? They said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Yea{G3483}, Lord{G2962}."
Matthew,9,29,"Then{G5119} touched he{G680}{(G5662)} their{G846} eyes{G3788}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, According{G2596} to your{G5216} faith{G4102} be it{G1096}{(G5676)} unto you{G5213}."
Matthew,9,30,"And{G2532} their{G846} eyes{G3788} were opened{G455}{(G5681)}; and{G2532} Jesus{G2424} straitly charged{G1690}{(G5662)} them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, See{G3708}{(G5720)} that no man{G3367} know{G1097}{(G5720)} it."
Matthew,9,31,"But{G1161} they, when they were departed{G1831}{(G5631)}, spread abroad{G1310} his{G846} fame{G1310}{(G5656)} in{G1722} all{G3650} that{G1565} country{G1093}."
Matthew,9,32,"As{G1161} they{G846} went out{G1831}{(G5740)}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, they brought{G4374}{(G5656)} to him{G846} a dumb{G2974} man{G444} possessed with a devil{G1139}{(G5740)}."
Matthew,9,33,"And{G2532} when the devil{G1140} was cast out{G1544}{(G5685)}, the dumb{G2974} spake{G2980}{(G5656)}: and{G2532} the multitudes{G3793} marvelled{G2296}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} It was never{G3763} so{G3779} seen{G5316}{(G5648)} in{G1722} Israel{G2474}."
Matthew,9,34,"But{G1161} the Pharisees{G5330} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, He casteth out{G1544}{(G5719)} devils{G1140} through{G1722} the prince{G758} of the devils{G1140}."
Matthew,9,35,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} went about{G4013}{(G5707)} all{G3956} the cities{G4172} and{G2532} villages{G2968}, teaching{G1321}{(G5723)} in{G1722} their{G846} synagogues{G4864}, and{G2532} preaching{G2784}{(G5723)} the gospel{G2098} of the kingdom{G932}, and{G2532} healing{G2323}{(G5723)} every{G3956} sickness{G3554} and{G2532} every{G3956} disease{G3119} among{G1722} the people{G2992}."
Matthew,9,36,"But{G1161} when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} the multitudes{G3793}, he was moved with compassion{G4697}{(G5675)} on{G4012} them{G846}, because{G3754} they fainted{G2258}{(G5713)}{G1590}{(G5772)}, and{G2532} were scattered abroad{G4496}{(G5772)}, as{G5616} sheep{G4263} having{G2192}{(G5723)} no{G3361} shepherd{G4166}."
Matthew,9,37,"Then{G5119} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} he unto his{G846} disciples{G3101}, The harvest{G2326} truly{G3303} is plenteous{G4183}, but{G1161} the labourers{G2040} are few{G3641};"
Matthew,9,38,"Pray ye{G1189}{(G5676)} therefore{G3767} the Lord{G2962} of the harvest{G2326}, that{G3704} he will send forth{G1544}{(G5632)} labourers{G2040} into{G1519} his{G846} harvest{G2326}."
Matthew,10,1,"And{G2532} when he had called{G4341}{(G5666)} unto him his{G846} twelve{G1427} disciples{G3101}, he gave{G1325}{(G5656)} them{G846} power{G1849} against unclean{G169} spirits{G4151}, to{G5620} cast{G1544} them{G846} out{G1544}{(G5721)}, and{G2532} to heal{G2323}{(G5721)} all manner{G3956} of sickness{G3554} and{G2532} all manner{G3956} of disease{G3119}."
Matthew,10,2,"Now{G1161} the names{G3686} of the twelve{G1427} apostles{G652} are{G2076}{(G5748)} these{G5023}; The first{G4413}, Simon{G4613}, who{G3588} is called{G3004}{(G5746)} Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} Andrew{G406} his{G846} brother{G80}; James{G2385} the son of{G3588} Zebedee{G2199}, and{G2532} John{G2491} his{G846} brother{G80};"

Matthew,12,4,"How{G4459} he entered into{G1525}{(G5627)}{G1519} the house{G3624} of God{G2316}, and{G2532} did eat{G5315}{(G5627)} the shewbread{G740}{G4286}, which{G3739} was{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5752)} for him{G846} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}, neither for{G3761} them which{G3326} were with him{G846}, but{G1508} only{G3441} for the priests{G2409}?"
Matthew,12,5,"Or{G2228} have ye{G314} not{G3756} read{G314}{(G5627)} in{G1722} the law{G3551}, how that{G3754} on the sabbath days{G4521} the priests{G2409} in{G1722} the temple{G2411} profane{G953}{(G5719)} the sabbath{G4521}, and{G2532} are{G1526}{(G5748)} blameless{G338}?"
Matthew,12,6,"But{G1161} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} in this place{G5602} is one{G2076}{(G5748)} greater than{G3187} the temple{G2411}."
Matthew,12,7,"But{G1161} if{G1487} ye had known{G1097}{(G5715)} what{G5101} this meaneth{G2076}{(G5748)}, I will have{G2309}{(G5719)} mercy{G1656}, and{G2532} not{G3756} sacrifice{G2378}, ye would{G302} not{G3756} have condemned{G2613}{(G5656)} the guiltless{G338}."
Matthew,12,8,For{G1063} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} is{G2076}{(G5748)} Lord{G2962} even{G2532} of the sabbath day{G4521}.
Matthew,12,9,"And{G2532} when he was departed{G3327}{(G5631)} thence{G1564}, he went{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} their{G846} synagogue{G4864}:"
Matthew,12,10,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a man{G444} which had{G2192}{(G5723)} his hand{G5495} withered{G3584}. And{G2532} they asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Is it lawful{G1487}{G1832}{(G5748)} to heal{G2323}{(G5721)} on the sabbath days{G4521}? that{G2443} they might accuse{G2723}{(G5661)} him{G846}."
Matthew,12,11,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, What{G5101} man{G444} shall there be{G2071}{(G5704)} among{G1537} you{G5216}, that{G3739} shall have{G2192}{(G5692)} one{G1520} sheep{G4263}, and{G2532} if{G1437} it{G5124} fall{G1706}{(G5632)} into{G1519} a pit{G999} on the sabbath day{G4521}, will he{G2902} not{G3780} lay hold{G2902}{(G5692)} on it{G846}, and{G2532} lift it out{G1453}{(G5692)}?"
Matthew,12,12,How much{G4214} then{G3767} is a man{G444} better than{G1308}{(G5719)} a sheep{G4263}? Wherefore{G5620} it is lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} to do{G4160}{(G5721)} well{G2573} on the sabbath days{G4521}.
Matthew,12,13,"Then{G5119} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} he to the man{G444}, Stretch forth{G1614}{(G5657)} thine{G4675} hand{G5495}. And{G2532} he stretched it forth{G1614}{(G5656)}; and{G2532} it was restored{G600}{(G5681)} whole{G5199}, like as{G5613} the other{G243}."
Matthew,12,14,"Then{G1161} the Pharisees{G5330} went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and held{G2983}{(G5627)} a council{G4824} against{G2596} him{G846}, how{G3704} they might destroy{G622}{(G5661)} him{G846}."
Matthew,12,15,"But{G1161} when Jesus{G2424} knew{G1097}{(G5631)} it, he withdrew himself{G402}{(G5656)} from thence{G1564}: and{G2532} great{G4183} multitudes{G3793} followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} he healed{G2323}{(G5656)} them{G846} all{G3956};"
Matthew,12,16,And{G2532} charged{G2008}{(G5656)} them{G846} that{G3363} they should{G4160} not{G3363} make{G4160}{(G5661)} him{G846} known{G5318}:
Matthew,12,17,"That{G3704} it might be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)} which{G3588} was spoken{G4483}{(G5685)} by{G1223} Esaias{G2268} the prophet{G4396}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Matthew,12,18,"Behold{G2400}{(G5628)} my{G3450} servant{G3816}, whom{G3739} I have chosen{G140}{(G5656)}; my{G3450} beloved{G27}, in{G1519} whom{G3739} my{G3450} soul{G5590} is well pleased{G2106}{(G5656)}: I will put{G5087}{(G5692)} my{G3450} spirit{G4151} upon{G1909} him{G846}, and{G2532} he shall shew{G518}{(G5692)} judgment{G2920} to the Gentiles{G1484}."
Matthew,12,19,"He shall{G2051} not{G3756} strive{G2051}{(G5692)}, nor{G3761} cry{G2905}{(G5692)}; neither{G3761} shall any man{G5100} hear{G191}{(G5692)} his{G846} voice{G5456} in{G1722} the streets{G4113}."
Matthew,12,20,"A bruised{G4937}{(G5772)} reed{G2563} shall he{G2608} not{G3756} break{G2608}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} smoking{G5188}{(G5746)} flax{G3043} shall he{G4570} not{G3756} quench{G4570}{(G5692)}, till{G2193}{G302} he send forth{G1544}{(G5632)} judgment{G2920} unto{G1519} victory{G3534}."
Matthew,12,21,And{G2532} in{G1722} his{G846} name{G3686} shall{G1679} the Gentiles{G1484} trust{G1679}{(G5692)}.
Matthew,12,22,"Then{G5119} was brought{G4374}{(G5681)} unto him{G846} one possessed with a devil{G1139}{(G5740)}, blind{G5185}, and{G2532} dumb{G2974}: and{G2532} he healed{G2323}{(G5656)} him{G846}, insomuch that{G5620} the blind{G5185} and{G2532} dumb{G2974} both{G2532} spake{G2980}{(G5721)} and{G2532} saw{G991}{(G5721)}."
Matthew,12,23,"And{G2532} all{G3956} the people{G3793} were amazed{G1839}{(G5710)}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3385} this{G3778} the son{G5207} of David{G1138}?"
Matthew,12,24,"But{G1161} when the Pharisees{G5330} heard{G191}{(G5660)} it, they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, This{G3778} fellow doth{G1544} not{G3756} cast out{G1544}{(G5719)} devils{G1140}, but{G1508} by{G1722} Beelzebub{G954} the prince{G758} of the devils{G1140}."
Matthew,12,25,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} knew{G1492}{(G5761)} their{G846} thoughts{G1761}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Every{G3956} kingdom{G932} divided{G3307}{(G5685)} against{G2596} itself{G1438} is brought to desolation{G2049}{(G5743)}; and{G2532} every{G3956} city{G4172} or{G2228} house{G3614} divided{G3307}{(G5685)} against{G2596} itself{G1438} shall{G2476} not{G3756} stand{G2476}{(G5701)}:"
Matthew,12,26,"And{G2532} if{G1487} Satan{G4567} cast out{G1544}{(G5719)} Satan{G4567}, he is divided{G3307}{(G5681)} against{G1909} himself{G1438}; how{G4459} shall{G2476} then{G3767} his{G846} kingdom{G932} stand{G2476}{(G5701)}?"
Matthew,12,27,"And{G2532} if{G1487} I{G1473} by{G1722} Beelzebub{G954} cast out{G1544}{(G5719)} devils{G1140}, by{G1722} whom{G5101} do your{G5216} children{G5207} cast them out{G1544}{(G5719)}? therefore{G5124}{G1223} they{G846} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} your{G5216} judges{G2923}."
Matthew,12,28,"But{G1161} if{G1487} I{G1473} cast out{G1544}{(G5719)} devils{G1140} by{G1722} the Spirit{G4151} of God{G2316}, then{G686} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316} is come{G5348}{(G5656)} unto{G1909} you{G5209}."
Matthew,12,29,"Or{G2228} else how{G4459} can{G1410}{(G5736)} one{G5100} enter{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} a strong man's{G2478} house{G3614}, and{G2532} spoil{G1283}{(G5658)} his{G846} goods{G4632}, except{G3362} he first{G4412} bind{G1210}{(G5661)} the strong man{G2478}? and{G2532} then{G5119} he will spoil{G1283}{(G5692)} his{G846} house{G3614}."
Matthew,12,30,He that is{G5607}{(G5752)} not{G3361} with{G3326} me{G1700} is{G2076}{(G5748)} against{G2596} me{G1700}; and{G2532} he that gathereth{G4863}{(G5723)} not{G3361} with{G3326} me{G1700} scattereth abroad{G4650}{(G5719)}.
Matthew,12,31,"Wherefore{G1223}{G5124} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, All manner of{G3956} sin{G266} and{G2532} blasphemy{G988} shall be forgiven{G863}{(G5701)} unto men{G444}: but{G1161} the blasphemy{G988} against the Holy Ghost{G4151} shall{G863} not{G3756} be forgiven{G863}{(G5701)} unto men{G444}."
Matthew,12,32,"And{G2532} whosoever{G3739}{G302} speaketh{G2036}{(G5632)} a word{G3056} against{G2596} the Son{G5207} of man{G444}, it shall be forgiven{G863}{(G5701)} him{G846}: but{G3739} whosoever{G1161}{G302} speaketh{G2036}{(G5632)} against{G2596} the Holy{G40} Ghost{G4151}, it shall{G863} not{G3756} be forgiven{G863}{(G5701)} him{G846}, neither{G3777} in{G1722} this{G5129} world{G165}, neither{G3777} in{G1722} the world to come{G3195}{(G5723)}."

Matthew,12,34,"O generation{G1081} of vipers{G2191}, how{G4459} can ye{G1410}{(G5736)}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} evil{G4190}, speak{G2980}{(G5721)} good things{G18}? for{G1063} out of{G1537} the abundance{G4051} of the heart{G2588} the mouth{G4750} speaketh{G2980}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,12,35,A good{G18} man{G444} out of{G1537} the good{G18} treasure{G2344} of the heart{G2588} bringeth forth{G1544}{(G5719)} good things{G18}: and{G2532} an evil{G4190} man{G444} out of{G1537} the evil{G4190} treasure{G2344} bringeth forth{G1544}{(G5719)} evil things{G4190}.
Matthew,12,36,"But{G1161} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} every{G3956} idle{G692} word{G4487} that{G3739}{G1437} men{G444} shall speak{G2980}{(G5661)}, they shall give{G591}{(G5692)} account{G3056} thereof{G4012}{G846} in{G1722} the day{G2250} of judgment{G2920}."

Matthew,13,1,"{G1161} The same{G1722}{G1565} day{G2250} went{G1831}{(G5631)} Jesus{G2424} out of{G575} the house{G3614}, and sat{G2521}{(G5711)} by{G3844} the sea side{G2281}."
Matthew,13,2,"And{G2532} great{G4183} multitudes{G3793} were gathered together{G4863}{(G5681)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, so that{G5620} he{G846} went{G1684}{(G5631)} into{G1519} a ship{G4143}, and sat{G2521}{(G5738)}; and{G2532} the whole{G3956} multitude{G3793} stood{G2476}{(G5715)} on{G1909} the shore{G123}."
Matthew,13,3,"And{G2532} he spake{G2980}{(G5656)} many things{G4183} unto them{G846} in{G1722} parables{G3850}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, a sower{G4687}{(G5723)} went forth{G1831}{(G5627)} to sow{G4687}{(G5721)};"
Matthew,13,4,"And{G2532} when{G1722} he{G846} sowed{G4687}{(G5721)}, some{G3739}{G3303} seeds fell{G4098}{(G5627)} by{G3844} the way side{G3598}, and{G2532} the fowls{G4071} came{G2064}{(G5627)} and{G2532} devoured{G2719} them{G846} up{G2719}{(G5627)}:"
Matthew,13,5,"Some{G1161}{G243} fell{G4098}{(G5627)} upon{G1909} stony places{G4075}, where{G3699} they had{G2192}{(G5707)} not{G3756} much{G4183} earth{G1093}: and{G2532} forthwith{G2112} they sprung up{G1816}{(G5656)}, because{G1223} they had{G2192}{(G5721)} no{G3361} deepness{G899} of earth{G1093}:"
Matthew,13,6,"And{G1161} when the sun{G2246} was up{G393}{(G5660)}, they were scorched{G2739}{(G5681)}; and{G2532} because{G1223} they had{G2192}{(G5721)} no{G3361} root{G4491}, they withered away{G3583}{(G5681)}."
Matthew,13,7,"And{G1161} some{G243} fell{G4098}{(G5627)} among{G1909} thorns{G173}; and{G2532} the thorns{G173} sprung up{G305}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} choked{G638}{(G5656)} them{G846}:"
Matthew,13,8,"But{G1161} other{G243} fell{G4098}{(G5627)} into{G1909} good{G2570} ground{G1093}, and{G2532} brought forth{G1325}{(G5707)} fruit{G2590}, some{G3739}{G3303} an hundredfold{G1540},{G1161} some{G3739} sixtyfold{G1835},{G1161} some{G3739} thirtyfold{G5144}."
Matthew,13,9,"Who{G3588} hath{G2192}{(G5723)} ears{G3775} to hear{G191}{(G5721)}, let him hear{G191}{(G5720)}."
Matthew,13,10,"And{G2532} the disciples{G3101} came{G4334}{(G5631)}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Why{G1302} speakest thou{G2980}{(G5719)} unto them{G846} in{G1722} parables{G3850}?"
Matthew,13,11,"He answered{G611}{(G5679)} and{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Because{G3754} it is given{G1325}{(G5769)} unto you{G5213} to know{G1097}{(G5629)} the mysteries{G3466} of the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772}, but{G1161} to them{G1565} it is{G1325} not{G3756} given{G1325}{(G5769)}."
Matthew,13,12,"For{G1063} whosoever{G3748} hath{G2192}{(G5719)}, to him{G846} shall be given{G1325}{(G5701)}, and{G2532} he shall have more abundance{G4052}{(G5701)}: but{G1161} whosoever{G3748} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} not{G3756}, from{G575} him{G846} shall be taken away{G142}{(G5701)} even{G2532} that{G3739} he hath{G2192}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore{G1223}{G5124} speak I{G2980}{(G5719)} to them{G846} in{G1722} parables{G3850}: because{G3754} they seeing{G991}{(G5723)} see{G991}{(G5719)} not{G3756}; and{G2532} hearing{G191}{(G5723)} they hear{G191}{(G5719)} not{G3756}, neither{G3761} do they understand{G4920}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,13,14,"And{G2532} in{G1909} them{G846} is fulfilled{G378}{(G5743)} the prophecy{G4394} of Esaias{G2268}, which{G3588} saith{G3004}{(G5723)}, By hearing{G189} ye shall hear{G191}{(G5692)}, and{G2532} shall{G4920} not{G3364} understand{G4920}{(G5655)}; and{G2532} seeing{G991}{(G5723)} ye shall see{G991}{(G5692)}, and{G2532} shall{G1492} not{G3364} perceive{G1492}{(G5632)}:"
Matthew,13,15,"For{G1063} this{G5127} people's{G2992} heart{G2588} is waxed gross{G3975}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} their ears{G3775} are dull{G917} of hearing{G191}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} their{G846} eyes{G3788} they have closed{G2576}{(G5656)}; lest at any time{G3379} they should see{G1492}{(G5632)} with their eyes{G3788}, and{G2532} hear{G191}{(G5661)} with their ears{G3775}, and{G2532} should understand{G4920}{(G5632)} with their heart{G2588}, and{G2532} should be converted{G1994}{(G5661)}, and{G2532} I should heal{G2390}{(G5667)} them{G846}."
Matthew,13,16,"But{G1161} blessed{G3107} are your{G5216} eyes{G3788}, for{G3754} they see{G991}{(G5719)}: and{G2532} your{G5216} ears{G3775}, for{G3754} they hear{G191}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,13,17,"For{G1063} verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} many{G4183} prophets{G4396} and{G2532} righteous{G1342} men have desired{G1937}{(G5656)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} those things which{G3739} ye see{G991}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} have{G1492} not{G3756} seen{G1492}{(G5627)} them; and{G2532} to hear{G191}{(G5658)} those things which{G3739} ye hear{G191}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} have{G191} not{G3756} heard{G191}{(G5656)} them."
Matthew,13,18,Hear{G191}{(G5657)} ye{G5210} therefore{G3767} the parable{G3850} of the sower{G4687}{(G5723)}.
Matthew,13,19,"When any{G3956} one heareth{G191}{(G5723)} the word{G3056} of the kingdom{G932}, and{G2532} understandeth{G4920}{(G5723)} it not{G3361}, then cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} the wicked{G4190} one, and{G2532} catcheth away{G726}{(G5719)} that which{G3588} was sown{G4687}{(G5772)} in{G1722} his{G846} heart{G2588}. This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he which received seed{G4687}{(G5651)} by{G3844} the way side{G3598}."
Matthew,13,20,"But{G1161} he that received the seed{G4687}{(G5651)} into{G1909} stony places{G4075}, the same{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he that heareth{G191}{(G5723)} the word{G3056}, and{G2532} anon{G2117} with{G3326} joy{G5479} receiveth{G2983}{(G5723)} it{G846};"
Matthew,13,21,"Yet{G1161} hath he{G2192}{(G5719)} not{G3756} root{G4491} in{G1722} himself{G1438}, but{G235} dureth{G2076}{(G5748)} for a while{G4340}: for{G1161} when tribulation{G2347} or{G2228} persecution{G1375} ariseth{G1096}{(G5637)} because{G1223} of the word{G3056}, by and by{G2117} he is offended{G4624}{(G5743)}."
Matthew,13,22,"He also{G1161} that received seed{G4687}{(G5651)} among{G1519} the thorns{G173} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he that{G3778} heareth{G191}{(G5723)} the word{G3056}; and{G2532} the care{G3308} of this{G5127} world{G165}, and{G2532} the deceitfulness{G539} of riches{G4149}, choke{G4846}{(G5719)} the word{G3056}, and{G2532} he becometh{G1096}{(G5736)} unfruitful{G175}."
Matthew,13,23,"But{G1161} he that received seed{G4687}{(G5651)} into{G1909} the good{G2570} ground{G1093} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he{G3778} that heareth{G191}{(G5723)} the word{G3056}, and{G2532} understandeth{G4920}{(G5723)} it; which{G3739} also{G1211} beareth fruit{G2592}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} bringeth forth{G4160}{(G5719)}, some{G3739}{G3303} an hundredfold{G1540},{G1161} some{G3739} sixty{G1835},{G1161} some{G3739} thirty{G5144}."
Matthew,13,24,"Another{G243} parable{G3850} put he forth{G3908}{(G5656)} unto them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, The kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772} is likened{G3666}{(G5681)} unto a man{G444} which sowed{G4687}{(G5723)}{(G5625)}{G4687}{(G5660)} good{G2570} seed{G4690} in{G1722} his{G846} field{G68}:"

Matthew,13,26,"But{G1161} when{G3753} the blade{G5528} was sprung up{G985}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} brought forth{G4160}{(G5656)} fruit{G2590}, then{G5119} appeared{G5316}{(G5648)} the tares{G2215} also{G2532}."
Matthew,13,27,"So{G1161} the servants{G1401} of the householder{G3617} came{G4334}{(G5631)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, didst{G4687} not{G3780} thou sow{G4687}{(G5656)} good{G2570} seed{G4690} in{G1722} thy{G4674} field{G68}? from whence{G4159} then{G3767} hath it{G2192}{(G5719)} tares{G2215}?"
Matthew,13,28,"{G1161} He said{G5346}{(G5713)} unto them{G846}, An enemy{G2190}{G444} hath done{G4160}{(G5656)} this{G5124}.{G1161} The servants{G1401} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Wilt thou{G2309}{(G5719)} then{G3767} that we go{G565}{(G5631)} and gather{G4816} them{G846} up{G4816}{(G5661)}?"
Matthew,13,29,"But{G1161} he said{G5346}{(G5713)}, Nay{G3756}; lest{G3379} while ye gather up{G4816}{(G5723)} the tares{G2215}, ye root up{G1610}{(G5661)} also the wheat{G4621} with{G260} them{G846}."

Matthew,13,47,"Again{G3825}, the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772} is{G2076}{(G5748)} like{G3664} unto a net{G4522}, that was cast{G906}{(G5685)} into{G1519} the sea{G2281}, and{G2532} gathered{G4863}{(G5631)} of{G1537} every{G3956} kind{G1085}:"
Matthew,13,48,"Which{G3739}, when{G3753} it was full{G4137}{(G5681)}, they drew{G307}{(G5660)} to{G1909} shore{G123}, and{G2532} sat down{G2523}{(G5660)}, and gathered{G4816}{(G5656)} the good{G2570} into{G1519} vessels{G30}, but{G1161} cast{G906}{(G5627)} the bad{G4550} away{G1854}."
Matthew,13,49,"So{G3779} shall it be{G2071}{(G5704)} at{G1722} the end{G4930} of the world{G165}: the angels{G32} shall come forth{G1831}{(G5695)}, and{G2532} sever{G873}{(G5692)} the wicked{G4190} from{G1537} among{G3319} the just{G1342},"
Matthew,13,50,And{G2532} shall cast{G906}{(G5692)} them{G846} into{G1519} the furnace{G2575} of fire{G4442}: there{G1563} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} wailing{G2805} and{G2532} gnashing{G1030} of teeth{G3599}.
Matthew,13,51,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Have ye understood{G4920}{(G5656)} all{G3956} these{G5023} things{G3956}? They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Yea{G3483}, Lord{G2962}."
Matthew,13,52,"Then{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} he unto them{G846}, Therefore{G1223}{G5124} every{G3956} scribe{G1122} which is instructed{G3100}{(G5685)} unto{G1519} the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772} is{G2076}{(G5748)} like{G3664} unto a man{G444} that is an householder{G3617}, which{G3748} bringeth forth{G1544}{(G5719)} out of{G1537} his{G846} treasure{G2344} things new{G2537} and{G2532} old{G3820}."
Matthew,13,53,"And{G2532} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, that when{G3753} Jesus{G2424} had finished{G5055}{(G5656)} these{G5025} parables{G3850}, he departed{G3332}{(G5656)} thence{G1564}."
Matthew,13,54,"And{G2532} when he was come{G2064}{(G5631)} into{G1519} his own{G846} country{G3968}, he taught{G1321}{(G5707)} them{G846} in{G1722} their{G846} synagogue{G4864}, insomuch that{G5620} they{G846} were astonished{G1605}{(G5745)}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5721)}, Whence{G4159} hath this man{G5129} this{G3778} wisdom{G4678}, and{G2532} these mighty works{G1411}?"
Matthew,13,55,"Is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} this{G3778} the carpenter's{G5045} son{G5207}? is{G3004} not{G3780} his{G846} mother{G3384} called{G3004}{(G5743)} Mary{G3137}? and{G2532} his{G846} brethren{G80}, James{G2385}, and{G2532} Joses{G2500}, and{G2532} Simon{G4613}, and{G2532} Judas{G2455}?"
Matthew,13,56,"And{G2532} his{G846} sisters{G79}, are they{G1526}{(G5748)} not{G3780} all{G3956} with{G4314} us{G2248}? Whence{G4159} then{G3767} hath this man{G5129} all{G3956} these things{G5023}?"
Matthew,13,57,"And{G2532} they were offended{G4624}{(G5712)} in{G1722} him{G846}. But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, A prophet{G4396} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} without honour{G820}, save{G1508} in{G1722} his own{G846} country{G3968}, and{G2532} in{G1722} his own{G846} house{G3614}."
Matthew,13,58,And{G2532} he did{G4160}{(G5656)} not{G3756} many{G4183} mighty works{G1411} there{G1563} because{G1223} of their{G846} unbelief{G570}.
Matthew,14,1,"At{G1722} that{G1565} time{G2540} Herod{G2264} the tetrarch{G5076} heard{G191}{(G5656)} of the fame{G189} of Jesus{G2424},"
Matthew,14,2,"And{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto his{G846} servants{G3816}, This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} John{G2491} the Baptist{G910}; he{G846} is risen{G1453}{(G5681)} from{G575} the dead{G3498}; and{G2532} therefore{G1223}{G5124} mighty works{G1411} do shew forth themselves{G1754}{(G5719)} in{G1722} him{G846}."
Matthew,14,3,"For{G1063} Herod{G2264} had laid hold{G2902}{(G5660)} on John{G2491}, and bound{G1210}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} put{G5087}{(G5639)} him in{G1722} prison{G5438} for{G1223} Herodias'{G2266} sake{G1223}, his{G846} brother{G80} Philip's{G5376} wife{G1135}."
Matthew,14,4,"For{G1063} John{G2491} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, It is{G1832} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} for thee{G4671} to have{G2192}{(G5721)} her{G846}."
Matthew,14,5,"And{G2532} when he would{G2309}{(G5723)} have put{G615} him{G846} to death{G615}{(G5658)}, he feared{G5399}{(G5675)} the multitude{G3793}, because{G3754} they counted{G2192}{(G5707)} him{G846} as{G5613} a prophet{G4396}."
Matthew,14,6,"But{G1161} when Herod's{G2264} birthday{G1077} was kept{G71}{(G5746)}, the daughter{G2364} of Herodias{G2266} danced{G3738}{(G5662)} before them{G1722}{G3319}, and{G2532} pleased{G700}{(G5656)} Herod{G2264}."
Matthew,14,7,Whereupon{G3606} he promised{G3670}{(G5656)} with{G3326} an oath{G3727} to give{G1325}{(G5629)} her{G846} whatsoever{G3739}{G1437} she would ask{G154}{(G5672)}.
Matthew,14,8,"And{G1161} she, being before instructed{G4264}{(G5685)} of{G5259} her{G846} mother{G3384}, said{G5346}{(G5748)}, Give{G1325}{(G5628)} me{G3427} here{G5602} John{G2491} Baptist's{G910} head{G2776} in{G1909} a charger{G4094}."
Matthew,14,9,"And{G2532} the king{G935} was sorry{G3076}{(G5681)}: nevertheless for{G1161}{G1223} the oath's sake{G3727}, and{G2532} them which sat with him at meat{G4873}{(G5740)}, he commanded{G2753}{(G5656)} it to be given{G1325}{(G5683)} her."
Matthew,14,10,"And{G2532} he sent{G3992}{(G5660)}, and beheaded{G607}{(G5656)} John{G2491} in{G1722} the prison{G5438}."
Matthew,14,11,"And{G2532} his{G846} head{G2776} was brought{G5342}{(G5681)} in{G1909} a charger{G4094}, and{G2532} given{G1325}{(G5681)} to the damsel{G2877}: and{G2532} she brought{G5342}{(G5656)} it to her{G846} mother{G3384}."
Matthew,14,12,"And{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101} came{G4334}{(G5631)}, and took up{G142}{(G5656)} the body{G4983}, and{G2532} buried{G2290}{(G5656)} it{G846}, and{G2532} went{G2064}{(G5631)} and told{G518}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424}."
Matthew,14,13,"When{G2532} Jesus{G2424} heard{G191}{(G5660)} of it, he departed{G402}{(G5656)} thence{G1564} by{G1722} ship{G4143} into{G1519} a desert{G2048} place{G5117} apart{G2596}{G2398}: and{G2532} when the people{G3793} had heard{G191}{(G5660)} thereof, they followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846} on foot{G3979} out of{G575} the cities{G4172}."
Matthew,14,14,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} went forth{G1831}{(G5631)}, and saw{G1492}{(G5627)} a great{G4183} multitude{G3793}, and{G2532} was moved with compassion{G4697}{(G5675)} toward{G1909} them{G846}, and{G2532} he healed{G2323}{(G5656)} their{G846} sick{G732}."
Matthew,14,15,"And{G1161} when it was{G1096}{(G5637)} evening{G3798}, his{G846} disciples{G3101} came{G4334}{(G5656)} to him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, This is{G2076}{(G5748)} a desert{G2048} place{G5117}, and{G2532} the time{G5610} is now{G2235} past{G3928}{(G5627)}; send{G630} the multitude{G3793} away{G630}{(G5657)}, that{G2443} they may go{G565}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the villages{G2968}, and buy{G59}{(G5661)} themselves{G1438} victuals{G1033}."
Matthew,14,16,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, They need{G5532} not{G3756} depart{G565}{(G5629)}{G2192}{(G5719)}; give{G1325}{(G5628)} ye{G5210} them{G846} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}."
Matthew,14,17,"And{G1161} they say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, We have{G2192}{(G5719)} here{G5602} but{G3756}{G1508} five{G4002} loaves{G740}, and{G2532} two{G1417} fishes{G2486}."
Matthew,14,18,"{G1161} He said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Bring{G5342}{(G5720)} them{G846} hither{G5602} to me{G3427}."
Matthew,14,19,"And{G2532} he commanded{G2753}{(G5660)} the multitude{G3793} to sit down{G347}{(G5683)} on{G1909} the grass{G5528}, and{G2532} took{G2983}{(G5631)} the five{G4002} loaves{G740}, and{G2532} the two{G1417} fishes{G2486}, and looking up{G308}{(G5660)} to{G1519} heaven{G3772}, he blessed{G2127}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} brake{G2806}{(G5660)}, and gave{G1325}{(G5656)} the loaves{G740} to his disciples{G3101}, and{G1161} the disciples{G3101} to the multitude{G3793}."
Matthew,14,20,"And{G2532} they did{G5315} all{G3956} eat{G5315}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} were filled{G5526}{(G5681)}: and{G2532} they took up{G142}{(G5656)} of the fragments{G2801} that remained{G4052}{(G5723)} twelve{G1427} baskets{G2894} full{G4134}."
Matthew,14,21,"And{G1161} they that had eaten{G2068}{(G5723)} were{G2258}{(G5713)} about{G5616} five thousand{G4000} men{G435}, beside{G5565} women{G1135} and{G2532} children{G3813}."
Matthew,14,22,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} Jesus{G2424} constrained{G315}{(G5656)} his{G846} disciples{G3101} to get{G1684}{(G5629)} into{G1519} a ship{G4143}, and{G2532} to go before{G4254}{(G5721)} him{G846} unto{G1519} the other side{G4008}, while{G2193}{G3739} he sent{G630} the multitudes{G3793} away{G630}{(G5661)}."
Matthew,14,23,"And{G2532} when he had sent{G630} the multitudes{G3793} away{G630}{(G5660)}, he went up{G305}{(G5627)} into{G1519} a mountain{G3735} apart{G2596}{G2398} to pray{G4336}{(G5664)}: and{G1161} when the evening{G3798} was come{G1096}{(G5637)}, he was{G2258}{(G5713)} there{G1563} alone{G3441}."
Matthew,14,24,"But{G1161} the ship{G4143} was{G2258}{(G5713)} now{G2235} in the midst{G3319} of the sea{G2281}, tossed{G928}{(G5746)} with{G5259} waves{G2949}: for{G1063} the wind{G417} was{G2258}{(G5713)} contrary{G1727}."
Matthew,14,25,"And{G1161} in the fourth{G5067} watch{G5438} of the night{G3571} Jesus{G2424} went{G565}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, walking{G4043}{(G5723)} on{G1909} the sea{G2281}."
Matthew,14,26,"And{G2532} when the disciples{G3101} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846} walking{G4043}{(G5723)} on{G1909} the sea{G2281}, they were troubled{G5015}{(G5681)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}{G3754}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} a spirit{G5326}; and{G2532} they cried out{G2896}{(G5656)} for{G575} fear{G5401}."
Matthew,14,27,"But{G1161} straightway{G2112} Jesus{G2424} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} unto them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Be of good cheer{G2293}{(G5720)}; it is{G1510}{(G5748)} I{G1473}; be{G5399} not{G3361} afraid{G5399}{(G5737)}."
Matthew,14,28,"And{G1161} Peter{G4074} answered{G611}{(G5679)} him{G846} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Lord{G2962}, if{G1487} it be{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771}, bid{G2753}{(G5657)} me{G3165} come{G2064}{(G5629)} unto{G4314} thee{G4571} on{G1909} the water{G5204}."
Matthew,14,29,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Come{G2064}{(G5628)}. And{G2532} when Peter{G4074} was come down{G2597}{(G5631)} out of{G575} the ship{G4143}, he walked{G4043}{(G5656)} on{G1909} the water{G5204}, to go{G2064}{(G5629)} to{G4314} Jesus{G2424}."
Matthew,14,30,"But{G1161} when he saw{G991}{(G5723)} the wind{G417} boisterous{G2478}, he was afraid{G5399}{(G5675)}; and{G2532} beginning{G756}{(G5671)} to sink{G2670}{(G5745)}, he cried{G2896}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Lord{G2962}, save{G4982}{(G5657)} me{G3165}."
Matthew,14,31,"And{G1161} immediately{G2112} Jesus{G2424} stretched forth{G1614}{(G5660)} his hand{G5495}, and caught{G1949}{(G5633)} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, O thou of little faith{G3640}, wherefore{G1519}{G5101} didst thou doubt{G1365}{(G5656)}?"
Matthew,14,32,"And{G2532} when they{G846} were come{G1684}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the ship{G4143}, the wind{G417} ceased{G2869}{(G5656)}."
Matthew,14,33,"Then{G1161} they that were in{G1722} the ship{G4143} came{G2064}{(G5631)} and worshipped{G4352}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Of a truth{G230} thou art{G1488}{(G5748)} the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}."
Matthew,14,34,"And{G2532} when they were gone over{G1276}{(G5660)}, they came{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the land{G1093} of Gennesaret{G1082}."
Matthew,14,35,"And{G2532} when the men{G435} of that{G1565} place{G5117} had knowledge{G1921}{(G5631)} of him{G846}, they sent out{G649}{(G5656)} into{G1519} all{G3650} that{G1565} country round about{G4066}, and{G2532} brought{G4374}{(G5656)} unto him{G846} all{G3956} that were{G2192}{(G5723)} diseased{G2560};"
Matthew,14,36,And{G2532} besought{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} that{G2443} they might{G680} only{G3440} touch{G680}{(G5672)} the hem{G2899} of his{G846} garment{G2440}: and{G2532} as many as{G3745} touched{G680}{(G5662)} were made perfectly whole{G1295}{(G5681)}.
Matthew,15,1,"Then{G5119} came{G4334}{(G5736)} to Jesus{G2424} scribes{G1122} and{G2532} Pharisees{G5330}, which were of{G575} Jerusalem{G2414}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Matthew,15,2,Why{G1302} do thy{G4675} disciples{G3101} transgress{G3845}{(G5719)} the tradition{G3862} of the elders{G4245}? for{G1063} they wash{G3538}{(G5731)} not{G3756} their{G846} hands{G5495} when{G3752} they eat{G2068}{(G5725)} bread{G740}.
Matthew,15,3,"But{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G1302} do ye{G5210} also{G2532} transgress{G3845}{(G5719)} the commandment{G1785} of God{G2316} by{G1223} your{G5216} tradition{G3862}?"

Matthew,15,9,"But{G1161} in vain{G3155} they do worship{G4576}{(G5736)} me{G3165}, teaching{G1321}{(G5723)} for doctrines{G1319} the commandments{G1778} of men{G444}."
Matthew,15,10,"And{G2532} he called{G4341}{(G5666)} the multitude{G3793}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Hear{G191}{(G5720)}, and{G2532} understand{G4920}{(G5720)}:"
Matthew,15,11,"Not{G3756} that which goeth{G1525}{(G5740)} into{G1519} the mouth{G4750} defileth{G2840}{(G5719)} a man{G444}; but{G235} that which cometh{G1607}{(G5740)} out of{G1537} the mouth{G4750}, this{G5124} defileth{G2840}{(G5719)} a man{G444}."
Matthew,15,12,"Then{G5119} came{G4334}{(G5631)} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Knowest thou{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} the Pharisees{G5330} were offended{G4624}{(G5681)}, after they heard{G191}{(G5660)} this saying{G3056}?"
Matthew,15,13,"But{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Every{G3956} plant{G5451}, which{G3739} my{G3450} heavenly{G3770} Father{G3962} hath{G5452} not{G3756} planted{G5452}{(G5656)}, shall be rooted up{G1610}{(G5701)}."

Matthew,15,22,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, a woman{G1135} of Canaan{G5478} came{G1831}{(G5631)} out of{G575} the same{G1565} coasts{G3725}, and cried{G2905}{(G5656)} unto him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Have mercy{G1653}{(G5657)} on me{G3165}, O Lord{G2962}, thou Son{G5207} of David{G1138}; my{G3450} daughter{G2364} is grievously{G2560} vexed with a devil{G1139}{(G5736)}."
Matthew,15,23,"But{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5662)} her{G846} not{G3756} a word{G3056}. And{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101} came{G4334}{(G5631)} and besought{G2065}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Send{G630} her{G846} away{G630}{(G5657)}; for{G3754} she crieth{G2896}{(G5719)} after{G3693} us{G2257}."
Matthew,15,24,"But{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I am{G649} not{G3756} sent{G649}{(G5648)} but{G1508} unto{G1519} the lost{G622}{(G5756)} sheep{G4263} of the house{G3624} of Israel{G2474}."
Matthew,15,25,"Then{G1161} came she{G2064}{(G5631)} and worshipped{G4352}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Lord{G2962}, help{G997}{(G5720)} me{G3427}."
Matthew,15,26,"But{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} meet{G2570} to take{G2983}{(G5629)} the children's{G5043} bread{G740}, and{G2532} to cast{G906}{(G5629)} it to dogs{G2952}."
Matthew,15,27,"And{G1161} she said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Truth{G3483}, Lord{G2962}: yet{G2532}{G1063} the dogs{G2952} eat{G2068}{(G5719)} of{G575} the crumbs{G5589} which{G3588} fall{G4098}{(G5723)} from{G575} their{G846} masters{G2962}' table{G5132}."
Matthew,15,28,"Then{G5119} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, O{G5599} woman{G1135}, great{G3173} is thy{G4675} faith{G4102}: be it{G1096}{(G5676)} unto thee{G4671} even as{G5613} thou wilt{G2309}{(G5719)}. And{G2532} her{G846} daughter{G2364} was made whole{G2390}{(G5681)} from{G575} that very{G1565} hour{G5610}."

Matthew,16,3,"And{G2532} in the morning{G4404}, It will be foul weather{G5494} to day{G4594}: for{G1063} the sky{G3772} is red{G4449}{(G5719)} and lowring{G4768}{(G5723)}. O ye hypocrites{G5273}, ye can{G1097}{(G5719)} discern{G1252}{(G5721)}{G3303} the face{G4383} of the sky{G3772}; but{G1161} can ye{G1410}{(G5736)} not{G3756} discern the signs{G4592} of the times{G2540}?"

Matthew,16,20,Then{G5119} charged he{G1291}{(G5668)} his{G846} disciples{G3101} that{G2443} they should tell{G2036}{(G5632)} no man{G3367} that{G3754} he{G846} was{G2076}{(G5748)} Jesus{G2424} the Christ{G5547}.
Matthew,16,21,"From{G575} that time forth{G5119} began{G756}{(G5662)} Jesus{G2424} to shew{G1166}{(G5721)} unto his{G846} disciples{G3101}, how that{G3754} he{G846} must{G1163}{(G5748)} go{G565}{(G5629)} unto{G1519} Jerusalem{G2414}, and{G2532} suffer{G3958}{(G5629)} many things{G4183} of{G575} the elders{G4245} and{G2532} chief priests{G749} and{G2532} scribes{G1122}, and{G2532} be killed{G615}{(G5683)}, and{G2532} be raised again{G1453}{(G5683)} the third{G5154} day{G2250}."
Matthew,16,22,"Then{G2532} Peter{G4074} took{G4355}{(G5642)} him{G846}, and began{G756}{(G5662)} to rebuke{G2008}{(G5721)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Be it far{G2436} from thee{G4671}, Lord{G2962}: this{G5124} shall{G2071} not{G3364} be{G2071}{(G5704)} unto thee{G4671}."
Matthew,16,23,"But{G1161} he turned{G4762}{(G5651)}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto Peter{G4074}, Get thee{G5217}{(G5720)} behind{G3694} me{G3450}, Satan{G4567}: thou{G1488}{(G5748)} art{G3754} an offence{G4625} unto me{G3450}: for thou savourest{G5426}{(G5719)} not{G3756} the things{G3588} that be of God{G2316}, but{G235} those that be of men{G444}."
Matthew,16,24,"Then{G5119} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto his{G846} disciples{G3101}, If any{G1536} man will{G2309}{(G5719)} come{G2064}{(G5629)} after{G3694} me{G3450}, let him deny{G533}{(G5663)} himself{G1438}, and{G2532} take up{G142}{(G5657)} his{G846} cross{G4716}, and{G2532} follow{G190}{(G5720)} me{G3427}."
Matthew,16,25,For{G1063} whosoever{G3739}{G302} will{G2309}{(G5725)} save{G4982}{(G5658)} his{G846} life{G5590} shall lose{G622}{(G5692)} it{G846}: and{G1161} whosoever{G3739}{G302} will lose{G622}{(G5661)} his{G846} life{G5590} for{G1752} my{G1700} sake{G1752} shall find{G2147}{(G5692)} it{G846}.

Matthew,17,15,"Lord{G2962}, have mercy{G1653}{(G5657)} on my{G3450} son{G5207}: for{G3754} he is lunatick{G4583}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} sore{G2560} vexed{G3958}{(G5719)}: for{G1063} ofttimes{G4178} he falleth{G4098}{(G5719)} into{G1519} the fire{G4442}, and{G2532} oft{G4178} into{G1519} the water{G5204}."
Matthew,17,16,"And{G2532} I brought{G4374}{(G5656)} him{G846} to thy{G4675} disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} they could{G1410}{(G5675)} not{G3756} cure{G2323}{(G5658)} him{G846}."
Matthew,17,17,"Then{G1161} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, O{G5599} faithless{G571} and{G2532} perverse{G1294}{(G5772)} generation{G1074}, how long{G2193}{G4219} shall I be{G2071}{(G5704)} with{G3326} you{G5216}? how long{G2193}{G4219} shall I suffer{G430}{(G5695)} you{G5216}? bring{G5342}{(G5720)} him{G846} hither{G5602} to me{G3427}."
Matthew,17,18,And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} the devil{G1140}; and{G2532} he{G846} departed{G1831}{(G5627)} out of{G575} him{G846}: and{G2532} the child{G3816} was cured{G2323}{(G5681)} from{G575} that very{G1565} hour{G5610}.
Matthew,17,19,"Then{G5119} came{G4334}{(G5631)} the disciples{G3101} to Jesus{G2424} apart{G2596}{G2398}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Why{G1302} could{G1410}{(G5675)} not{G3756} we{G2249} cast{G1544} him{G846} out{G1544}{(G5629)}?"

Matthew,18,8,"Wherefore{G1161} if{G1487} thy{G4675} hand{G5495} or{G2228} thy{G4675} foot{G4228} offend thee{G4624}{(G5719)}, cut{G1581} them{G846} off{G1581}{(G5657)}, and{G2532} cast{G906}{(G5628)} them from{G575} thee{G4571}{G4675}: it is{G2076}{(G5748)} better{G2570} for thee{G4671} to enter into{G1525}{(G5629)}{G1519} life{G2222} halt{G5560} or{G2228} maimed{G2948}, rather than{G2228} having{G2192}{(G5723)} two{G1417} hands{G5495} or{G2228} two{G1417} feet{G4228} to be cast{G906}{(G5683)} into{G1519} everlasting{G166} fire{G4442}."
Matthew,18,9,"And{G2532} if{G1487} thine{G4675} eye{G3788} offend{G4624}{(G5719)} thee{G4571}, pluck{G1807} it{G846} out{G1807}{(G5628)}, and{G2532} cast{G906}{(G5628)} it from{G575} thee{G4675}: it is{G2076}{(G5748)} better{G2570} for thee{G4671} to enter{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} life{G2222} with one eye{G3442}, rather than{G2228} having{G2192}{(G5723)} two{G1417} eyes{G3788} to be cast{G906}{(G5683)} into{G1519} hell{G1067} fire{G4442}."
Matthew,18,10,"Take heed{G3708}{(G5720)} that ye despise{G2706}{(G5661)} not{G3361} one{G1520} of these{G5130} little ones{G3398}; for{G1063} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} in{G1722} heaven{G3772} their{G846} angels{G32} do always{G1223}{G3956} behold{G991}{(G5719)} the face{G4383} of my{G3450} Father{G3962} which{G3588} is in{G1722} heaven{G3772}."
Matthew,18,11,For{G1063} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} is come{G2064}{(G5627)} to save{G4982}{(G5658)} that which{G3588} was lost{G622}{(G5756)}.
Matthew,18,12,"How{G5101} think{G1380}{(G5719)} ye{G5213}? if{G1437}{G5100} a man{G444} have{G1096}{(G5638)} an hundred{G1540} sheep{G4263}, and{G2532} one{G1520} of{G1537} them{G846} be gone astray{G4105}{(G5686)}, doth he{G863} not{G3780} leave{G863}{(G5631)} the ninety and nine{G1768}, and goeth{G4198}{(G5679)} into{G1909} the mountains{G3735}, and seeketh{G2212}{(G5719)} that which{G3588} is gone astray{G4105}{(G5746)}?"
Matthew,18,13,"And{G2532} if so{G1437} be{G1096}{(G5638)} that he find{G2147}{(G5629)} it{G846}, verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}{G3754}, he rejoiceth{G5463}{(G5719)} more{G3123} of{G1909} that{G846} sheep, than{G2228} of{G1909} the ninety and nine{G1768} which{G3588} went{G4105} not{G3361} astray{G4105}{(G5772)}."
Matthew,18,14,"Even so{G3779} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} the will{G2307} of{G1715} your{G5216} Father{G3962} which{G3588} is in{G1722} heaven{G3772}, that{G2443} one{G1520} of these{G5130} little ones{G3398} should perish{G622}{(G5643)}."
Matthew,18,15,"Moreover{G1161} if{G1437} thy{G4675} brother{G80} shall trespass{G264}{(G5661)} against{G1519} thee{G4571}, go{G5217}{(G5720)} and{G2532} tell{G1651} him{G846} his fault{G1651}{(G5657)} between{G3342} thee{G4675} and{G2532} him{G846} alone{G3441}: if{G1437} he shall hear{G191}{(G5661)} thee{G4675}, thou hast gained{G2770}{(G5656)} thy{G4675} brother{G80}."
Matthew,18,16,"But{G1161} if{G3362} he will{G191} not{G3362} hear{G191}{(G5661)} thee, then take{G3880}{(G5628)} with{G3326} thee{G4675} one{G1520} or{G2228} two{G1417} more{G2089}, that{G2443} in{G1909} the mouth{G4750} of two{G1417} or{G2228} three{G5140} witnesses{G3144} every{G3956} word{G4487} may be established{G2476}{(G5686)}."
Matthew,18,17,"And{G1161} if{G1437} he shall neglect to hear{G3878}{(G5661)} them{G846}, tell{G2036}{(G5628)} it unto the church{G1577}: but{G1161}{G2532} if{G1437} he neglect to hear{G3878}{(G5661)} the church{G1577}, let him be{G2077}{(G5749)} unto thee{G4671} as{G5618} an heathen man{G1482} and{G2532} a publican{G5057}."
Matthew,18,18,"Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, Whatsoever{G3745}{G1437} ye shall bind{G1210}{(G5661)} on{G1909} earth{G1093} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} bound{G1210}{(G5772)} in{G1722} heaven{G3772}: and{G2532} whatsoever{G3745}{G1437} ye shall loose{G3089}{(G5661)} on{G1909} earth{G1093} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} loosed{G3089}{(G5772)} in{G1722} heaven{G3772}."
Matthew,18,19,"Again{G3825} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} if{G1437} two{G1417} of you{G5216} shall agree{G4856}{(G5661)} on{G1909} earth{G1093} as touching{G4012} any{G3956} thing{G4229} that{G3739}{G1437} they shall ask{G154}{(G5672)}, it shall be done{G1096}{(G5695)} for them{G846} of{G3844} my{G3450} Father{G3962} which{G3588} is in{G1722} heaven{G3772}."
Matthew,18,20,"For{G1063} where{G3757} two{G1417} or{G2228} three{G5140} are{G1526}{(G5748)} gathered together{G4863}{(G5772)} in{G1519} my{G1699} name{G3686}, there{G1563} am I{G1510}{(G5748)} in{G1722} the midst{G3319} of them{G846}."
Matthew,18,21,"Then{G5119} came{G4334}{(G5631)} Peter{G4074} to him{G846}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Lord{G2962}, how oft{G4212} shall my{G3450} brother{G80} sin{G264}{(G5692)} against{G1519} me{G1691}, and{G2532} I forgive{G863}{(G5692)} him{G846}? till{G2193} seven times{G2034}?"
Matthew,18,22,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} not{G3756} unto thee{G4671}, Until{G2193} seven times{G2034}: but{G235}, Until{G2193} seventy times{G1441} seven{G2033}."
Matthew,18,23,"Therefore{G1223}{G5124} is the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772} likened{G3666}{(G5681)} unto a certain{G444} king{G935}, which{G3739} would{G2309}{(G5656)} take{G4868}{(G5658)} account{G3056} of{G3326} his{G846} servants{G1401}."
Matthew,18,24,"And{G1161} when he{G846} had begun{G756}{(G5671)} to reckon{G4868}{(G5721)}, one{G1520} was brought{G4374}{(G5681)} unto him{G846}, which owed{G3781} him{G846} ten thousand{G3463} talents{G5007}."
Matthew,18,25,"But forasmuch as{G1161} he{G846} had{G2192}{(G5723)} not{G3361} to pay{G591}{(G5629)}, his{G846} lord{G2962} commanded{G2753}{(G5656)} him{G846} to be sold{G4097}{(G5683)}, and{G2532} his{G846} wife{G1135}, and{G2532} children{G5043}, and{G2532} all{G3956} that{G3745} he had{G2192}{(G5707)}, and{G2532} payment to be made{G591}{(G5683)}."
Matthew,18,26,"The servant{G1401} therefore{G3767} fell down{G4098}{(G5631)}, and worshipped{G4352}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Lord{G2962}, have patience{G3114}{(G5657)} with{G1909} me{G1698}, and{G2532} I will pay{G591}{(G5692)} thee{G4671} all{G3956}."
Matthew,18,27,"Then{G1161} the lord{G2962} of that{G1565} servant{G1401} was moved with compassion{G4697}{(G5679)}, and loosed{G630}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} forgave{G863}{(G5656)} him{G846} the debt{G1156}."
Matthew,18,28,"But{G1161} the same{G1565} servant{G1401} went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and found{G2147}{(G5627)} one{G1520} of his{G846} fellowservants{G4889}, which{G3739} owed{G3784}{(G5707)} him{G846} an hundred{G1540} pence{G1220}: and{G2532} he laid hands{G2902}{(G5660)} on him{G846}, and took him by the throat{G4155}{(G5707)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Pay{G591}{(G5628)} me{G3427} that{G3748} thou owest{G3784}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,18,29,"And{G3767} his{G846} fellowservant{G4889} fell down{G4098}{(G5631)} at{G1519} his{G846} feet{G4228}, and besought{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Have patience{G3114}{(G5657)} with{G1909} me{G1698}, and{G2532} I will pay{G591}{(G5692)} thee{G4671} all{G3956}."
Matthew,18,30,"And{G1161} he would{G2309}{(G5707)} not{G3756}: but{G235} went{G565}{(G5631)} and cast{G906}{(G5627)} him{G846} into{G1519} prison{G5438}, till{G2193}{G3739} he should pay{G591}{(G5632)} the debt{G3784}{(G5746)}."
Matthew,18,31,"So{G1161} when his{G846} fellowservants{G4889} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} what was done{G1096}{(G5637)}, they were very{G4970} sorry{G3076}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5631)} and told{G1285}{(G5656)} unto their{G846} lord{G2962} all{G3956} that was done{G1096}{(G5637)}."
Matthew,18,32,"Then{G5119} his{G846} lord{G2962}, after that he had called{G4341}{(G5666)} him{G846}, said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, O thou wicked{G4190} servant{G1401}, I forgave{G863}{(G5656)} thee{G4671} all{G3956} that{G1565} debt{G3782}, because{G1893} thou desiredst{G3870}{(G5656)} me{G3165}:"
Matthew,18,33,"Shouldest{G1163}{(G5713)} not{G3756} thou{G4571} also{G2532} have had compassion{G1653}{(G5658)} on thy{G4675} fellowservant{G4889}, even{G2532} as{G5613} I{G1473} had pity{G1653}{(G5656)} on thee{G4571}?"
Matthew,18,34,"And{G2532} his{G846} lord{G2962} was wroth{G3710}{(G5685)}, and delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} him{G846} to the tormentors{G930}, till{G2193}{G3739} he should pay{G591}{(G5632)} all{G3956} that was due{G3784}{(G5746)} unto him{G846}."
Matthew,18,35,"So{G3779} likewise shall my{G3450} heavenly{G2032} Father{G3962} do{G4160}{(G5692)} also{G2532} unto you{G5213}, if{G3362} ye from{G575} your{G5216} hearts{G2588} forgive{G863}{(G5632)} not{G3362} every one{G1538} his{G846} brother{G80} their{G846} trespasses{G3900}."
Matthew,19,1,"And{G2532} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, that when{G3753} Jesus{G2424} had finished{G5055}{(G5656)} these{G5128} sayings{G3056}, he departed{G3332}{(G5656)} from{G575} Galilee{G1056}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the coasts{G3725} of Judaea{G2449} beyond{G4008} Jordan{G2446};"
Matthew,19,2,And{G2532} great{G4183} multitudes{G3793} followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}; and{G2532} he healed{G2323}{(G5656)} them{G846} there{G1563}.
Matthew,19,3,"The Pharisees{G5330} also{G2532} came{G4334}{(G5656)} unto him{G846}, tempting{G3985}{(G5723)} him{G846}, and{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)} unto him{G846}, Is it lawful{G1487}{G1832}{(G5748)} for a man{G444} to put away{G630}{(G5658)} his{G846} wife{G1135} for{G2596} every{G3956} cause{G156}?"
Matthew,19,4,"And{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Have ye{G314} not{G3756} read{G314}{(G5627)}, that{G3754} he which{G3588} made{G4160}{(G5660)} them at{G575} the beginning{G746} made{G4160}{(G5656)} them{G846} male{G730} and{G2532} female{G2338},"
Matthew,19,5,"And{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, For this{G5127} cause{G1752} shall a man{G444} leave{G2641}{(G5692)} father{G3962} and{G2532} mother{G3384}, and{G2532} shall cleave{G4347}{(G5701)} to his{G846} wife{G1135}: and{G2532} they twain{G1417} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)}{G1519} one{G3391} flesh{G4561}?"
Matthew,19,6,"Wherefore{G5620} they are{G1526}{(G5748)} no more{G3765} twain{G1417}, but{G235} one{G3391} flesh{G4561}. What{G3739} therefore{G3767} God{G2316} hath joined together{G4801}{(G5656)}, let{G5563} not{G3361} man{G444} put asunder{G5563}{(G5720)}."
Matthew,19,7,"They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Why{G5101} did Moses{G3475} then{G3767} command{G1781}{(G5662)} to give{G1325}{(G5629)} a writing{G975} of divorcement{G647}, and{G2532} to put{G630} her{G846} away{G630}{(G5658)}?"
Matthew,19,8,"He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846},{G3754} Moses{G3475} because of{G4314} the hardness{G4641} of your{G5216} hearts{G4641} suffered{G2010}{(G5656)} you{G5213} to put away{G630}{(G5658)} your{G5216} wives{G1135}: but{G1161} from{G575} the beginning{G746} it was{G1096}{(G5754)} not{G3756} so{G3779}."
Matthew,19,9,"And{G1161} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} Whosoever{G3739}{G302} shall put away{G630}{(G5661)} his{G846} wife{G1135}, except{G1508} it be for{G1909} fornication{G4202}, and{G2532} shall marry{G1060}{(G5661)} another{G243}, committeth adultery{G3429}{(G5736)}: and{G2532} whoso marrieth{G1060}{(G5660)} her which{G3588} is put away{G630}{(G5772)} doth commit adultery{G3429}{(G5736)}."
Matthew,19,10,"His{G846} disciples{G3101} say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, If{G1487} the case{G156} of the man{G444} be{G2076}{(G5748)} so{G3779} with{G3326} his wife{G1135}, it is{G4851} not{G3756} good{G4851}{(G5719)} to marry{G1060}{(G5658)}."
Matthew,19,11,"But{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, All{G3956} men cannot{G3756} receive{G5562}{(G5719)} this{G5126} saying{G3056}, save{G235} they to whom{G3739} it is given{G1325}{(G5769)}."
Matthew,19,12,"For{G1063} there are{G1526}{(G5748)} some eunuchs{G2135}, which{G3748} were so{G3779} born{G1080}{(G5681)} from{G1537} their mother's{G3384} womb{G2836}: and{G2532} there are{G1526}{(G5748)} some eunuchs{G2135}, which{G3748} were made eunuchs{G2134}{(G5656)} of{G5259} men{G444}: and{G2532} there be{G1526}{(G5748)} eunuchs{G2135}, which{G3748} have made{G2134} themselves{G1438} eunuchs{G2134}{(G5656)} for{G1223} the kingdom{G932} of heaven's sake{G3772}. He that is able{G1410}{(G5740)} to receive{G5562}{(G5721)} it, let him receive{G5562}{(G5720)} it."
Matthew,19,13,"Then{G5119} were there brought{G4374}{(G5681)} unto him{G846} little children{G3813}, that{G2443} he should put{G2007} his hands{G5495} on{G2007}{(G5632)} them{G846}, and{G2532} pray{G4336}{(G5667)}: and{G1161} the disciples{G3101} rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} them{G846}."
Matthew,19,14,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Suffer{G863}{(G5628)} little children{G3813}, and{G2532} forbid{G2967}{(G5720)} them{G846} not{G3361}, to come{G2064}{(G5629)} unto{G4314} me{G3165}: for{G1063} of such{G5108} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772}."
Matthew,19,15,"And{G2532} he laid{G2007} his hands{G5495} on{G2007}{(G5631)} them{G846}, and departed{G4198}{(G5675)} thence{G1564}."
Matthew,19,16,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, one{G1520} came{G4334}{(G5631)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Good{G18} Master{G1320}, what{G5101} good thing{G18} shall I do{G4160}{(G5661)}, that{G2443} I may have{G2192}{(G5725)} eternal{G166} life{G2222}?"
Matthew,19,17,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Why{G5101} callest thou{G3004}{(G5719)} me{G3165} good{G18}? there is none{G3762} good{G18} but{G1508} one{G1520}, that is, God{G2316}: but{G1161} if{G1487} thou wilt{G2309}{(G5719)} enter{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} life{G2222}, keep{G5083}{(G5657)} the commandments{G1785}."
Matthew,19,18,"He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Which{G4169}?{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Thou shalt do{G5407} no{G3756} murder{G5407}{(G5692)}, Thou shalt{G3431} not{G3756} commit adultery{G3431}{(G5692)}, Thou shalt{G2813} not{G3756} steal{G2813}{(G5692)}, Thou shalt{G5576} not{G3756} bear false witness{G5576}{(G5692)},"
Matthew,19,19,"Honour{G5091}{(G5720)} thy{G4675} father{G3962} and{G2532} thy mother{G3384}: and{G2532}, Thou shalt love{G25}{(G5692)} thy{G4675} neighbour{G4139} as{G5613} thyself{G4572}."
Matthew,19,20,"The young man{G3495} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, All{G3956} these things{G5023} have I kept{G5442}{(G5668)} from{G1537} my{G3450} youth up{G3503}: what{G5101} lack{G5302}{(G5719)} I yet{G2089}?"
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus{G2424} said{G5346}{(G5713)} unto him{G846}, If{G1487} thou wilt{G2309}{(G5719)} be{G1511}{(G5750)} perfect{G5046}, go{G5217}{(G5720)} and sell{G4453}{(G5657)} that thou{G4675} hast{G5224}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} give{G1325}{(G5628)} to the poor{G4434}, and{G2532} thou shalt have{G2192}{(G5692)} treasure{G2344} in{G1722} heaven{G3772}: and{G2532} come{G1204}{(G5773)} and follow{G190}{(G5720)} me{G3427}."
Matthew,19,22,"But{G1161} when the young man{G3495} heard{G191}{(G5660)} that saying{G3056}, he went away{G565}{(G5627)} sorrowful{G3076}{(G5746)}: for{G1063} he had{G2192}{(G5723)}{G2258}{(G5713)} great{G4183} possessions{G2933}."
Matthew,19,23,"Then{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} a rich man{G4145} shall hardly{G1423} enter{G1525}{(G5695)} into{G1519} the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772}."
Matthew,19,24,"And{G1161} again{G3825} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} easier{G2123} for a camel{G2574} to go{G1330}{(G5629)} through{G1223} the eye{G5169} of a needle{G4476}, than{G2228} for a rich man{G4145} to enter{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}."
Matthew,19,25,"When{G1161} his{G846} disciples{G3101} heard{G191}{(G5660)} it, they were exceedingly{G4970} amazed{G1605}{(G5712)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Who{G5101} then{G686} can{G1410}{(G5736)} be saved{G4982}{(G5683)}?"
Matthew,19,26,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} beheld{G1689}{(G5660)} them, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, With{G3844} men{G444} this{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} impossible{G102}; but{G1161} with{G3844} God{G2316} all things{G3956} are{G2076}{(G5748)} possible{G1415}."
Matthew,19,27,"Then{G5119} answered{G611}{(G5679)} Peter{G4074} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, we{G2249} have forsaken{G863}{(G5656)} all{G3956}, and{G2532} followed{G190}{(G5656)} thee{G4671}; what{G5101} shall we{G2254} have{G2071}{(G5704)} therefore{G686}?"
Matthew,19,28,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} ye{G5210} which{G3588} have followed{G190}{(G5660)} me{G3427}, in{G1722} the regeneration{G3824} when{G3752} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} shall sit{G2523}{(G5661)} in{G1909} the throne{G2362} of his{G846} glory{G1391}, ye{G5210} also{G2532} shall sit{G2523}{(G5695)} upon{G1909} twelve{G1427} thrones{G2362}, judging{G2919}{(G5723)} the twelve{G1427} tribes{G5443} of Israel{G2474}."
Matthew,19,29,"And{G2532} every{G3956} one{G3739} that hath forsaken{G863}{(G5656)} houses{G3614}, or{G2228} brethren{G80}, or{G2228} sisters{G79}, or{G2228} father{G3962}, or{G2228} mother{G3384}, or{G2228} wife{G1135}, or{G2228} children{G5043}, or{G2228} lands{G68}, for my{G3450} name's{G3686} sake{G1752}, shall receive{G2983}{(G5695)} an hundredfold{G1542}, and{G2532} shall inherit{G2816}{(G5692)} everlasting{G166} life{G2222}."
Matthew,19,30,But{G1161} many{G4183} that are first{G4413} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} last{G2078}; and{G2532} the last{G2078} shall be first{G4413}.
Matthew,20,1,"For{G1063} the kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772} is{G2076}{(G5748)} like{G3664} unto a man{G444} that is an householder{G3617}, which{G3748} went out{G1831}{(G5627)} early in the morning{G260}{G4404} to hire{G3409}{(G5670)} labourers{G2040} into{G1519} his{G846} vineyard{G290}."
Matthew,20,2,"And{G1161} when he had agreed{G4856}{(G5660)} with{G3326} the labourers{G2040} for{G1537} a penny{G1220} a day{G2250}, he sent{G649}{(G5656)} them{G846} into{G1519} his{G846} vineyard{G290}."
Matthew,20,3,"And{G2532} he went out{G1831}{(G5631)} about{G4012} the third{G5154} hour{G5610}, and saw{G1492}{(G5627)} others{G243} standing{G2476}{(G5761)} idle{G692} in{G1722} the marketplace{G58},"
Matthew,20,4,"And said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G2548}; Go{G5217}{(G5720)} ye{G5210} also{G2532} into{G1519} the vineyard{G290}, and{G2532} whatsoever{G3739}{G1437} is{G5600}{(G5753)} right{G1342} I will give{G1325}{(G5692)} you{G5213}. And{G1161} they went their way{G565}{(G5627)}."
Matthew,20,5,"Again{G3825} he went out{G1831}{(G5631)} about{G4012} the sixth{G1623} and{G2532} ninth{G1766} hour{G5610}, and did{G4160}{(G5656)} likewise{G5615}."
Matthew,20,6,"And{G1161} about{G4012} the eleventh{G1734} hour{G5610} he went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and found{G2147}{(G5627)} others{G243} standing{G2476}{(G5761)} idle{G692}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} stand ye{G2476}{(G5758)} here{G5602} all{G3650} the day{G2250} idle{G692}?"
Matthew,20,7,"They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Because{G3754} no man{G3762} hath hired{G3409}{(G5668)} us{G2248}. He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Go{G5217}{(G5720)} ye{G5210} also{G2532} into{G1519} the vineyard{G290}; and{G2532} whatsoever{G3739}{G1437} is{G5600}{(G5753)} right{G1342}, that shall ye receive{G2983}{(G5695)}."
Matthew,20,8,"So{G1161} when even{G3798} was come{G1096}{(G5637)}, the lord{G2962} of the vineyard{G290} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto his{G846} steward{G2012}, Call{G2564}{(G5657)} the labourers{G2040}, and{G2532} give{G591}{(G5628)} them{G846} their hire{G3408}, beginning{G756}{(G5671)} from{G575} the last{G2078} unto{G2193} the first{G4413}."
Matthew,20,9,"And{G2532} when they came{G2064}{(G5631)} that were hired about{G4012} the eleventh{G1734} hour{G5610}, they received{G2983}{(G5627)} every man{G303} a penny{G1220}."
Matthew,20,10,"But{G1161} when the first{G4413} came{G2064}{(G5631)}, they supposed{G3543}{(G5656)} that{G3754} they should have received{G2983}{(G5695)} more{G4119}; and{G2532} they likewise{G2532} received{G2983}{(G5627)} every man{G846}{G303} a penny{G1220}."
Matthew,20,11,"And{G1161} when they had received{G2983}{(G5631)} it, they murmured{G1111}{(G5707)} against{G2596} the goodman of the house{G3617},"
Matthew,20,12,"{G3754} Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, These{G3778} last{G2078} have wrought{G4160}{(G5656)} but one{G3391} hour{G5610}, and{G2532} thou hast made{G4160}{(G5656)} them{G846} equal{G2470} unto us{G2254}, which{G3588} have borne{G941}{(G5660)} the burden{G922} and{G2532} heat{G2742} of the day{G2250}."
Matthew,20,13,"But{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} one{G1520} of them{G846}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Friend{G2083}, I do{G91} thee{G4571} no{G3756} wrong{G91}{(G5719)}: didst{G4856} not{G3780} thou agree{G4856}{(G5656)} with me{G3427} for a penny{G1220}?"
Matthew,20,14,"Take{G142}{(G5657)} that thine{G4674} is, and{G2532} go thy way{G5217}{(G5720)}:{G1161} I will{G2309}{(G5719)} give{G1325}{(G5629)} unto this{G5129} last{G2078}, even{G2532} as{G5613} unto thee{G4671}."
Matthew,20,15,"{G2228} Is it not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} for me{G3427} to do{G4160}{(G5658)} what{G3739} I will{G2309}{(G5719)} with{G1722} mine own{G1699}?{G1487} Is{G2076}{(G5748)} thine{G4675} eye{G3788} evil{G4190}, because{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} good{G18}?"
Matthew,20,16,"So{G3779} the last{G2078} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} first{G4413}, and{G2532} the first{G4413} last{G2078}: for{G1063} many{G4183} be{G1526}{(G5748)} called{G2822}, but{G1161} few{G3641} chosen{G1588}."
Matthew,20,17,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} going up{G305}{(G5723)} to{G1519} Jerusalem{G2414} took{G3880}{(G5627)} the twelve{G1427} disciples{G3101} apart{G2596}{G2398} in{G1722} the way{G3598}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846},"

Matthew,21,44,"And{G2532} whosoever shall fall{G4098}{(G5631)} on{G1909} this{G5126} stone{G3037} shall be broken{G4917}{(G5701)}: but{G1161} on{G1909} whomsoever{G3739}{G302} it shall fall{G4098}{(G5632)}, it will grind{G3039} him{G846} to powder{G3039}{(G5692)}."
Matthew,21,45,"And{G2532} when the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} Pharisees{G5330} had heard{G191}{(G5660)} his{G846} parables{G3850}, they perceived{G1097}{(G5627)} that{G3754} he spake{G3004}{(G5719)} of{G4012} them{G846}."
Matthew,21,46,"But{G2532} when they sought{G2212}{(G5723)} to lay hands{G2902}{(G5658)} on him{G846}, they feared{G5399}{(G5675)} the multitude{G3793}, because{G1894} they took{G2192}{(G5707)} him{G846} for{G5613} a prophet{G4396}."
Matthew,22,1,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and spake{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846} again{G3825} by{G1722} parables{G3850}, and said{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Matthew,22,2,"The kingdom{G932} of heaven{G3772} is like{G3666}{(G5681)} unto a certain{G444} king{G935}, which{G3748} made{G4160}{(G5656)} a marriage{G1062} for his{G846} son{G5207},"
Matthew,22,3,And{G2532} sent forth{G649}{(G5656)} his{G846} servants{G1401} to call{G2564}{(G5658)} them that were bidden{G2564}{(G5772)} to{G1519} the wedding{G1062}: and{G2532} they would{G2309}{(G5707)} not{G3756} come{G2064}{(G5629)}.
Matthew,22,4,"Again{G3825}, he sent forth{G649}{(G5656)} other{G243} servants{G1401}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Tell{G2036}{(G5628)} them which are bidden{G2564}{(G5772)}, Behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, I have prepared{G2090}{(G5656)} my{G3450} dinner{G712}: my{G3450} oxen{G5022} and{G2532} my fatlings{G4619} are killed{G2380}{(G5772)}, and{G2532} all things{G3956} are ready{G2092}: come{G1205}{(G5773)} unto{G1519} the marriage{G1062}."
Matthew,22,5,"But{G1161} they made light of{G272}{(G5660)} it, and went their ways{G565}{(G5627)}, one{G3303} to{G1519} his{G2398} farm{G68}, another{G1161} to{G1519} his{G846} merchandise{G1711}:"
Matthew,22,6,"And{G1161} the remnant{G3062} took{G2902}{(G5660)} his{G846} servants{G1401}, and entreated them spitefully{G5195}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} slew{G615}{(G5656)} them."
Matthew,22,7,"But{G1161} when the king{G935} heard{G191}{(G5660)} thereof, he was wroth{G3710}{(G5681)}: and{G2532} he sent forth{G3992}{(G5660)} his{G846} armies{G4753}, and destroyed{G622}{(G5656)} those{G1565} murderers{G5406}, and{G2532} burned up{G1714}{(G5656)} their{G846} city{G4172}."
Matthew,22,8,"Then{G5119} saith he{G3004}{(G5719)} to his{G846} servants{G1401},{G3303} The wedding{G1062} is{G2076}{(G5748)} ready{G2092}, but{G1161} they which were bidden{G2564}{(G5772)} were{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G3756} worthy{G514}."
Matthew,22,9,"Go ye{G4198}{(G5737)} therefore{G3767} into{G1909} the highways{G1327}{G3598}, and{G2532} as many as{G3745}{G302} ye shall find{G2147}{(G5632)}, bid{G2564}{(G5657)} to{G1519} the marriage{G1062}."
Matthew,22,10,"So{G2532} those{G1565} servants{G1401} went out{G1831}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the highways{G3598}, and gathered together{G4863}{(G5627)} all{G3956} as many as{G3745} they found{G2147}{(G5627)}, both{G5037} bad{G4190} and{G2532} good{G18}: and{G2532} the wedding{G1062} was furnished{G4130}{(G5681)} with guests{G345}{(G5740)}."
Matthew,22,11,"And{G1161} when{G1525} the king{G935} came in{G1525}{(G5631)} to see{G2300}{(G5664)} the guests{G345}{(G5740)}, he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} there{G1563} a man{G444} which had{G1746} not{G3756} on{G1746}{(G5765)} a wedding{G1062} garment{G1742}:"
Matthew,22,12,"And{G2532} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Friend{G2083}, how{G4459} camest thou{G1525}{(G5627)} in hither{G5602} not{G3361} having{G2192}{(G5723)} a wedding{G1062} garment{G1742}? And{G1161} he was speechless{G5392}{(G5681)}."
Matthew,22,13,"Then{G5119} said{G2036}{(G5627)} the king{G935} to the servants{G1249}, Bind{G1210}{(G5660)} him{G846} hand{G5495} and{G2532} foot{G4228}, and take{G142} him{G846} away{G142}{(G5657)}, and{G2532} cast{G1544}{(G5628)} him into{G1519} outer{G1857} darkness{G4655}; there{G1563} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} weeping{G2805} and{G2532} gnashing{G1030} of teeth{G3599}."
Matthew,22,14,"For{G1063} many{G4183} are{G1526}{(G5748)} called{G2822}, but{G1161} few{G3641} are chosen{G1588}."
Matthew,22,15,"Then{G5119} went{G4198}{(G5679)} the Pharisees{G5330}, and took{G2983}{(G5627)} counsel{G4824} how{G3704} they might entangle{G3802}{(G5661)} him{G846} in{G1722} his talk{G3056}."
Matthew,22,16,"And{G2532} they sent out{G649}{(G5719)} unto him{G846} their{G846} disciples{G3101} with{G3326} the Herodians{G2265}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G1320}, we know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} thou art{G1488}{(G5748)} true{G227}, and{G2532} teachest{G1321}{(G5719)} the way{G3598} of God{G2316} in{G1722} truth{G225},{G2532} neither{G3756} carest{G3199}{(G5719)} thou{G4671} for{G4012} any{G3762} man: for{G1063} thou regardest{G991}{(G5719)} not{G1519}{G3756} the person{G4383} of men{G444}."
Matthew,22,17,"Tell{G2036}{(G5628)} us{G2254} therefore{G3767}, What{G5101} thinkest{G1380}{(G5719)} thou{G4671}? Is it lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} to give{G1325}{(G5629)} tribute{G2778} unto Caesar{G2541}, or{G2228} not{G3756}?"
Matthew,22,18,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} perceived{G1097}{(G5631)} their{G846} wickedness{G4189}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Why{G5101} tempt ye{G3985}{(G5719)} me{G3165}, ye hypocrites{G5273}?"
Matthew,22,19,Shew{G1925}{(G5657)} me{G3427} the tribute{G2778} money{G3546}. And{G1161} they brought{G4374}{(G5656)} unto him{G846} a penny{G1220}.
Matthew,22,20,"And{G2532} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Whose{G5101} is this{G3778} image{G1504} and{G2532} superscription{G1923}?"
Matthew,22,21,"They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Caesar's{G2541}. Then{G5119} saith he{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Render{G591}{(G5628)} therefore{G3767} unto Caesar{G2541} the things which are{G3588} Caesar's{G2541}; and{G2532} unto God{G2316} the things that are{G3588} God's{G2316}."
Matthew,22,22,"When{G2532} they had heard{G191}{(G5660)} these words, they marvelled{G2296}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} left{G863}{(G5631)} him{G846}, and went their way{G565}{(G5627)}."
Matthew,22,23,"The same{G1722}{G1565} day{G2250} came{G4334}{(G5656)} to him{G846} the Sadducees{G4523}, which{G3588} say{G3004}{(G5723)} that there is{G1511}{(G5750)} no{G3361} resurrection{G386}, and{G2532} asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846},"
Matthew,22,24,"Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G1320}, Moses{G3475} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, If{G1437} a man{G5100} die{G599}{(G5632)}, having{G2192}{(G5723)} no{G3361} children{G5043}, his{G846} brother{G80} shall marry{G1918}{(G5692)} his{G846} wife{G1135}, and{G2532} raise up{G450}{(G5692)} seed{G4690} unto his{G846} brother{G80}."
Matthew,22,25,"Now{G1161} there were{G2258}{(G5713)} with{G3844} us{G2254} seven{G2033} brethren{G80}: and{G2532} the first{G4413}, when he had married a wife{G1060}{(G5660)}, deceased{G5053}{(G5656)}, and{G2532}, having{G2192}{(G5723)} no{G3361} issue{G4690}, left{G863}{(G5656)} his{G846} wife{G1135} unto his{G846} brother{G80}:"
Matthew,22,26,"Likewise{G3668} the second{G1208} also{G2532}, and{G2532} the third{G5154}, unto{G2193} the seventh{G2033}."
Matthew,22,27,And{G1161} last{G5305} of all{G3956} the woman{G1135} died{G599}{(G5627)} also{G2532}.
Matthew,22,28,Therefore{G3767} in{G1722} the resurrection{G386} whose{G5101} wife{G1135} shall she be{G2071}{(G5704)} of the seven{G2033}? for{G1063} they all{G3956} had{G2192}{(G5627)} her{G846}.
Matthew,22,29,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Ye do err{G4105}{(G5744)}, not{G3361} knowing{G1492}{(G5761)} the scriptures{G1124}, nor{G3366} the power{G1411} of God{G2316}."
Matthew,22,30,"For{G1063} in{G1722} the resurrection{G386} they neither{G3777} marry{G1060}{(G5719)}, nor{G3777} are given in marriage{G1547}{(G5743)}, but{G235} are{G1526}{(G5748)} as{G5613} the angels{G32} of God{G2316} in{G1722} heaven{G3772}."
Matthew,22,31,"But{G1161} as touching{G4012} the resurrection{G386} of the dead{G3498}, have ye{G314} not{G3756} read{G314}{(G5627)} that which{G3588} was spoken{G4483}{(G5685)} unto you{G5213} by{G5259} God{G2316}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"

Matthew,22,33,"And{G2532} when the multitude{G3793} heard{G191}{(G5660)} this, they were astonished{G1605}{(G5712)} at{G1909} his{G846} doctrine{G1322}."
Matthew,22,34,"But{G1161} when the Pharisees{G5330} had heard{G191}{(G5660)} that{G3754} he had put{G5392} the Sadducees{G4523} to silence{G5392}{(G5656)}, they were gathered together{G4863}{(G5681)}{G1909}{G846}."
Matthew,22,35,"Then{G2532} one{G1520} of{G1537} them{G846}, which was a lawyer{G3544}, asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him a question, tempting{G3985}{(G5723)} him{G846}, and{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Matthew,22,36,"Master{G1320}, which{G4169} is the great{G3173} commandment{G1785} in{G1722} the law{G3551}?"
Matthew,22,37,"{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Thou shalt love{G25}{(G5692)} the Lord{G2962} thy{G4675} God{G2316} with{G1722} all{G3650} thy{G4675} heart{G2588}, and{G2532} with{G1722} all{G3650} thy{G4675} soul{G5590}, and{G2532} with{G1722} all{G3650} thy{G4675} mind{G1271}."
Matthew,22,38,This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the first{G4413} and{G2532} great{G3173} commandment{G1785}.
Matthew,22,39,"And{G1161} the second{G1208} is like{G3664} unto it{G846}{(G5625)}{G3778}, Thou shalt love{G25}{(G5692)} thy{G4675} neighbour{G4139} as{G5613} thyself{G4572}."

Matthew,25,8,"And{G1161} the foolish{G3474} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto the wise{G5429}, Give{G1325}{(G5628)} us{G2254} of{G1537} your{G5216} oil{G1637}; for{G3754} our{G2257} lamps{G2985} are gone out{G4570}{(G5743)}."
Matthew,25,9,"But{G1161} the wise{G5429} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Not so; lest{G3379} there be{G714} not{G3756} enough{G714}{(G5661)} for us{G2254} and{G2532} you{G5213}: but{G1161} go ye{G4198}{(G5737)} rather{G3123} to them{G4314} that sell{G4453}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} buy{G59}{(G5657)} for yourselves{G1438}."
Matthew,25,10,"And{G1161} while they{G846} went{G565}{(G5740)} to buy{G59}{(G5658)}, the bridegroom{G3566} came{G2064}{(G5627)}; and{G2532} they that were ready{G2092} went in{G1525}{(G5627)} with{G3326} him{G846} to{G1519} the marriage{G1062}: and{G2532} the door{G2374} was shut{G2808}{(G5681)}."

Matthew,26,27,"And{G2532} he took{G2983}{(G5631)} the cup{G4221}, and{G2532} gave thanks{G2168}{(G5660)}, and gave{G1325}{(G5656)} it to them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Drink ye{G4095}{(G5628)} all{G3956} of{G1537} it{G846};"
Matthew,26,28,"For{G1063} this{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} my{G3450} blood{G129} of the new{G2537} testament{G1242}, which{G3588} is shed{G1632}{(G5746)} for{G4012} many{G4183} for{G1519} the remission{G859} of sins{G266}."
Matthew,26,29,"But{G1161} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, I will{G4095} not{G3754}{G3364} drink{G4095}{(G5632)} henceforth{G575}{G737} of{G1537} this{G5127} fruit{G1081} of the vine{G288}, until{G2193} that{G1565} day{G2250} when{G3752} I drink{G4095}{(G5725)} it{G846} new{G2537} with{G3326} you{G5216} in{G1722} my{G3450} Father's{G3962} kingdom{G932}."
Matthew,26,30,"And{G2532} when they had sung an hymn{G5214}{(G5660)}, they went out{G1831}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the mount{G3735} of Olives{G1636}."
Matthew,26,31,"Then{G5119} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424} unto them{G846}, All{G3956} ye{G5210} shall be offended{G4624}{(G5701)} because{G1722} of me{G1722}{G1698} this{G5026} night{G3571}: for{G1063} it is written{G1125}{(G5769)}, I will smite{G3960}{(G5692)} the shepherd{G4166}, and{G2532} the sheep{G4263} of the flock{G4167} shall be scattered abroad{G1287}{(G5701)}."
Matthew,26,32,"But{G1161} after{G3326} I{G3165} am risen again{G1453}{(G5683)}, I will go before{G4254}{(G5692)} you{G5209} into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}."
Matthew,26,33,"Peter{G4074} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Though{G1499} all{G3956} men shall be offended{G4624}{(G5701)} because{G1722} of thee{G4671}, yet will I{G1473} never{G3763} be offended{G4624}{(G5701)}."
Matthew,26,34,"Jesus{G2424} said{G5346}{(G5713)} unto him{G846}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, That{G3754} this{G1722}{G5026} night{G3571}, before{G4250} the cock{G220} crow{G5455}{(G5658)}, thou shalt deny{G533}{(G5695)} me{G3165} thrice{G5151}."
Matthew,26,35,"Peter{G4074} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Though{G2579} I{G3165} should{G1163}{(G5753)} die{G599}{(G5629)} with{G4862} thee{G4671}, yet{G3364} will I{G533} not{G3364} deny{G533}{(G5695)} thee{G4571}. Likewise{G3668} also{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} all{G3956} the disciples{G3101}."
Matthew,26,36,"Then{G5119} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} Jesus{G2424} with{G3326} them{G846} unto{G1519} a place{G5564} called{G3004}{(G5746)} Gethsemane{G1068}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto the disciples{G3101}, Sit ye{G2523}{(G5657)} here{G847}, while{G2193}{G3739} I go{G565}{(G5631)} and pray{G4336}{(G5667)} yonder{G1563}."
Matthew,26,37,"And{G2532} he took with him{G3880}{(G5631)} Peter{G4074} and{G2532} the two{G1417} sons{G5207} of Zebedee{G2199}, and began{G756}{(G5662)} to be sorrowful{G3076}{(G5745)} and{G2532} very heavy{G85}{(G5721)}."
Matthew,26,38,"Then{G5119} saith he{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, My{G3450} soul{G5590} is{G2076}{(G5748)} exceeding sorrowful{G4036}, even unto{G2193} death{G2288}: tarry ye{G3306}{(G5657)} here{G5602}, and{G2532} watch{G1127}{(G5720)} with{G3326} me{G1700}."
Matthew,26,39,"And{G2532} he went{G4281} a little{G3397} further{G4281}{(G5631)}, and fell{G4098}{(G5627)} on{G1909} his{G846} face{G4383}, and{G2532} prayed{G4336}{(G5740)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, O my{G3450} Father{G3962}, if{G1487} it be{G2076}{(G5748)} possible{G1415}, let{G3928} this{G5124} cup{G4221} pass{G3928}{(G5628)} from{G575} me{G1700}: nevertheless{G4133} not{G3756} as{G5613} I{G1473} will{G2309}{(G5719)}, but{G235} as{G5613} thou{G4771} wilt."
Matthew,26,40,"And{G2532} he cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} unto{G4314} the disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} findeth{G2147}{(G5719)} them{G846} asleep{G2518}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto Peter{G4074}, What{G3779}, could ye{G2480}{(G5656)} not{G3756} watch{G1127}{(G5658)} with{G3326} me{G1700} one{G3391} hour{G5610}?"
Matthew,26,41,"Watch{G1127}{(G5720)} and{G2532} pray{G4336}{(G5737)}, that{G3363} ye enter{G1525}{(G5632)} not{G3363} into{G1519} temptation{G3986}: the spirit{G4151} indeed{G3303} is willing{G4289}, but{G1161} the flesh{G4561} is weak{G772}."
Matthew,26,42,"He went away{G565}{(G5631)} again{G3825} the{G1537} second time{G1208}, and prayed{G4336}{(G5662)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, O my{G3450} Father{G3962}, if{G1487} this{G5124} cup{G4221} may{G1410}{(G5736)} not{G3756} pass away{G3928}{(G5629)} from{G575} me{G1700}, except{G3362} I drink{G4095}{(G5632)} it{G846}, thy{G4675} will{G2307} be done{G1096}{(G5676)}."
Matthew,26,43,And{G2532} he came{G2064}{(G5631)} and found{G2147}{(G5719)} them{G846} asleep{G2518}{(G5723)} again{G3825}: for{G1063} their{G846} eyes{G3788} were{G2258}{(G5713)} heavy{G916}{(G5772)}.
Matthew,26,44,"And{G2532} he left{G863}{(G5631)} them{G846}, and went away{G565}{(G5631)} again{G3825}, and prayed{G4336}{(G5662)}{G1537} the third time{G5154}, saying{G2036}{(G5631)} the same{G846} words{G3056}."
Matthew,26,45,"Then{G5119} cometh he{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G4314} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Sleep on{G2518}{(G5719)} now{G3063}, and{G2532} take your rest{G373}{(G5731)}{(G5732)}: behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, the hour{G5610} is at hand{G1448}{(G5758)}, and{G2532} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} is betrayed{G3860}{(G5743)} into{G1519} the hands{G5495} of sinners{G268}."
Matthew,26,46,"Rise{G1453}{(G5728)}, let us be going{G71}{(G5725)}: behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, he is at hand{G1448}{(G5758)} that doth betray{G3860}{(G5723)} me{G3165}."
Matthew,26,47,"And{G2532} while{G2089} he{G846} yet{G2089} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, lo{G2400}{(G5628)}, Judas{G2455}, one{G1520} of the twelve{G1427}, came{G2064}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} with{G3326} him{G846} a great{G4183} multitude{G3793} with{G3326} swords{G3162} and{G2532} staves{G3586}, from{G575} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} elders{G4245} of the people{G2992}."
Matthew,26,48,"Now{G1161} he that betrayed{G3860}{(G5723)} him{G846} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} them{G846} a sign{G4592}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Whomsoever{G3739}{G302} I shall kiss{G5368}{(G5661)}, that same{G846} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he{G846}: hold{G2902} him{G846} fast{G2902}{(G5657)}."
Matthew,26,49,"And{G2532} forthwith{G2112} he came{G4334}{(G5631)} to Jesus{G2424}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Hail{G5463}{(G5720)}, master{G4461}; and{G2532} kissed{G2705}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Matthew,26,50,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Friend{G2083}, wherefore{G1909}{G3739} art thou come{G3918}{(G5748)}? Then{G5119} came they{G4334}{(G5631)}, and laid{G1911}{(G5627)} hands{G5495} on{G1909} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} took{G2902}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Matthew,26,51,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, one{G1520} of them which were with{G3326} Jesus{G2424} stretched out{G1614}{(G5660)} his hand{G5495}, and drew{G645}{(G5656)} his{G846} sword{G3162}, and{G2532} struck{G3960}{(G5660)} a servant{G1401} of the high priest's{G749}, and smote off{G851}{(G5627)} his{G846} ear{G5621}."
Matthew,26,52,"Then{G5119} said{G3004}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424} unto him{G846}, Put up again{G654}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} sword{G3162} into{G1519} his{G846} place{G5117}: for{G1063} all they{G3956} that take{G2983}{(G5631)} the sword{G3162} shall perish{G622}{(G5698)} with{G1722} the sword{G3162}."
Matthew,26,53,"{G2228} Thinkest thou{G1380}{(G5719)} that{G3754} I cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} now{G737} pray{G3870}{(G5658)} to my{G3450} Father{G3962}, and{G2532} he shall presently give{G3936}{(G5692)} me{G3427} more{G4119} than{G2228} twelve{G1427} legions{G3003} of angels{G32}?"
Matthew,26,54,"But how{G4459} then{G3767} shall the scriptures{G1124} be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}, that{G3754} thus{G3779} it must{G1163}{(G5748)} be{G1096}{(G5635)}?"
Matthew,26,55,"In{G1722} that same{G1565} hour{G5610} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} to the multitudes{G3793}, Are ye come out{G1831}{(G5627)} as{G5613} against{G1909} a thief{G3027} with{G3326} swords{G3162} and{G2532} staves{G3586} for to take{G4815}{(G5629)} me{G3165}? I sat{G2516}{(G5711)} daily{G2250}{G2596} with{G4314} you{G5209} teaching{G1321}{(G5723)} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}, and{G2532} ye laid{G2902} no{G3756} hold{G2902}{(G5656)} on me{G3165}."
Matthew,26,56,"But{G1161} all{G3650} this{G5124} was done{G1096}{(G5754)}, that{G2443} the scriptures{G1124} of the prophets{G4396} might be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}. Then{G5119} all{G3956} the disciples{G3101} forsook{G863}{(G5631)} him{G846}, and fled{G5343}{(G5627)}."
Matthew,26,57,"And{G1161} they that had laid hold{G2902}{(G5660)} on Jesus{G2424} led him away{G520}{(G5627)} to{G4314} Caiaphas{G2533} the high priest{G749}, where{G3699} the scribes{G1122} and{G2532} the elders{G4245} were assembled{G4863}{(G5681)}."
Matthew,26,58,"But{G1161} Peter{G4074} followed{G190}{(G5707)} him{G846} afar off{G575}{G3113} unto{G2193} the high priest's{G749} palace{G833}, and{G2532} went{G1525}{(G5631)} in{G2080}, and sat{G2521}{(G5711)} with{G3326} the servants{G5257}, to see{G1492}{(G5629)} the end{G5056}."
Matthew,26,59,"Now{G1161} the chief priests{G749}, and{G2532} elders{G4245}, and{G2532} all{G3650} the council{G4892}, sought{G2212}{(G5707)} false witness{G5577} against{G2596} Jesus{G2424}, to{G3704} put{G2289} him{G846} to death{G2289}{(G5661)};"
Matthew,26,60,"But{G2532} found{G2147}{(G5627)} none{G3756}: yea{G2532}, though many{G4183} false witnesses{G5575} came{G4334}{(G5631)}, yet found they{G2147}{(G5627)} none{G3756}.{G1161} At the last{G5305} came{G4334}{(G5631)} two{G1417} false witnesses{G5575},"

Matthew,26,63,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} held his peace{G4623}{(G5707)}.

Matthew,26,73,"And{G1161} after{G3326} a while{G3397} came unto him they{G4334}{(G5631)} that stood by{G2476}{(G5761)}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} to Peter{G4074}, Surely{G230} thou{G4771} also{G2532} art{G1488}{(G5748)} one of{G1537} them{G846}; for{G1063}{G2532} thy{G4675} speech{G2981} bewrayeth{G1212} thee{G4571}{G4160}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,26,74,"Then{G5119} began he{G756}{(G5662)} to curse{G2653}{(G5721)} and{G2532} to swear{G3660}{(G5721)}, saying,{G3754} I know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} the man{G444}. And{G2532} immediately{G2112} the cock{G220} crew{G5455}{(G5656)}."
Matthew,26,75,"And{G2532} Peter{G4074} remembered{G3415}{(G5681)} the word{G4487} of Jesus{G2424}, which{G3588} said{G2046}{(G5761)} unto him{G846}, Before{G3754}{G4250} the cock{G220} crow{G5455}{(G5658)}, thou shalt deny{G533}{(G5695)} me{G3165} thrice{G5151}. And{G2532} he went out{G1854}, and{G1831}{(G5631)} wept{G2799}{(G5656)} bitterly{G4090}."
Matthew,27,1,"When{G1161} the morning{G4405} was come{G1096}{(G5637)}, all{G3956} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} elders{G4245} of the people{G2992} took{G2983}{(G5627)} counsel{G4824} against{G2596} Jesus{G2424} to{G5620} put{G2289} him{G846} to death{G2289}{(G5658)}:"
Matthew,27,2,"And{G2532} when they had bound{G1210}{(G5660)} him{G846}, they led him away{G520}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} him{G846} to Pontius{G4194} Pilate{G4091} the governor{G2232}."
Matthew,27,3,"Then{G5119} Judas{G2455}, which{G3588} had betrayed{G3860}{(G5723)} him{G846}, when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} that{G3754} he was condemned{G2632}{(G5681)}, repented himself{G3338}{(G5679)}, and brought again{G654}{(G5656)} the thirty{G5144} pieces of silver{G694} to the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} elders{G4245},"
Matthew,27,4,"Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, I have sinned{G264}{(G5627)} in that I have betrayed{G3860}{(G5631)} the innocent{G121} blood{G129}. And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, What{G5101} is that to{G4314} us{G2248}? see{G3700}{(G5695)} thou{G4771} to that."
Matthew,27,5,"And{G2532} he cast down{G4496}{(G5660)} the pieces of silver{G694} in{G1722} the temple{G3485}, and departed{G402}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} went{G565}{(G5631)} and hanged himself{G519}{(G5668)}."
Matthew,27,6,"And{G1161} the chief priests{G749} took{G2983}{(G5631)} the silver pieces{G694}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, It is{G1832} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} for to put{G906}{(G5629)} them{G846} into{G1519} the treasury{G2878}, because{G1893} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} the price{G5092} of blood{G129}."
Matthew,27,7,"And{G1161} they took{G2983}{(G5631)} counsel{G4824}, and bought{G59}{(G5656)} with{G1537} them{G846} the potter's{G2763} field{G68}, to{G1519} bury{G5027} strangers{G3581} in{G5027}."
Matthew,27,8,"Wherefore{G1352} that{G1565} field{G68} was called{G2564}{(G5681)}, The field{G68} of blood{G129}, unto{G2193} this day{G4594}."
Matthew,27,9,"Then{G5119} was fulfilled{G4137}{(G5681)} that which{G3588} was spoken{G4483}{(G5685)} by{G1223} Jeremy{G2408} the prophet{G4396}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, And{G2532} they took{G2983}{(G5627)} the thirty{G5144} pieces of silver{G694}, the price{G5092} of him that was valued{G5091}{(G5772)}, whom{G3739} they of{G575} the children{G5207} of Israel{G2474} did value{G5091}{(G5668)};"
Matthew,27,10,"And{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} them{G846} for{G1519} the potter's{G2763} field{G68}, as{G2505} the Lord{G2962} appointed{G4929}{(G5656)} me{G3427}."
Matthew,27,11,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} stood{G2476}{(G5627)} before{G1715} the governor{G2232}: and{G2532} the governor{G2232} asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} the King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}? And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G5346}{(G5713)} unto him{G846}, Thou{G4771} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)}."
Matthew,27,12,"And{G2532} when{G1722} he{G846} was accused{G2723}{(G5745)} of{G5259} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} elders{G4245}, he answered{G611}{(G5662)} nothing{G3762}."
Matthew,27,13,"Then{G5119} said{G3004}{(G5719)} Pilate{G4091} unto him{G846}, Hearest thou{G191}{(G5719)} not{G3756} how many things{G4214} they witness against{G2649}{(G5719)} thee{G4675}?"
Matthew,27,14,And{G2532} he answered{G3756}{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846} to{G4314} never{G3761} a{G1520} word{G4487}; insomuch{G5620} that the governor{G2232} marvelled{G2296}{(G5721)} greatly{G3029}.
Matthew,27,15,"Now{G1161} at{G2596} that feast{G1859} the governor{G2232} was wont{G1486}{(G5715)} to release{G630}{(G5721)} unto the people{G3793} a{G1520} prisoner{G1198}, whom{G3739} they would{G2309}{(G5707)}."
Matthew,27,16,"And{G1161} they had{G2192}{(G5707)} then{G5119} a notable{G1978} prisoner{G1198}, called{G3004}{(G5746)} Barabbas{G912}."
Matthew,27,17,"Therefore{G3767} when they{G846} were gathered together{G4863}{(G5772)}, Pilate{G4091} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Whom{G5101} will ye{G2309}{(G5719)} that I release{G630}{(G5661)} unto you{G5213}? Barabbas{G912}, or{G2228} Jesus{G2424} which{G3588} is called{G3004}{(G5746)} Christ{G5547}?"
Matthew,27,18,For{G1063} he knew{G1492}{(G5715)} that{G3754} for{G1223} envy{G5355} they had delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} him{G846}.
Matthew,27,19,"When{G1161} he{G846} was set down{G2521}{(G5740)} on{G1909} the judgment seat{G968}, his{G846} wife{G1135} sent{G649}{(G5656)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G2532} Have thou{G4671} nothing{G3367} to do with that{G1565} just man{G1342}: for{G1063} I have suffered{G3958}{(G5627)} many things{G4183} this day{G4594} in{G2596} a dream{G3677} because{G1223} of him{G846}."
Matthew,27,20,"But{G1161} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} elders{G4245} persuaded{G3982}{(G5656)} the multitude{G3793} that{G2443} they should ask{G154}{(G5672)} Barabbas{G912}, and{G1161} destroy{G622}{(G5661)} Jesus{G2424}."
Matthew,27,21,"The governor{G2232} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Whether{G5101} of{G575} the twain{G1417} will ye{G2309}{(G5719)} that I release{G630}{(G5661)} unto you{G5213}?{G1161} They said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Barabbas{G912}."
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate{G4091} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, What{G5101} shall I do{G4160}{(G5692)} then{G3767} with Jesus{G2424} which{G3588} is called{G3004}{(G5746)} Christ{G5547}? They all{G3956} say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Let him be crucified{G4717}{(G5682)}."
Matthew,27,23,"And{G1161} the governor{G2232} said{G5346}{(G5713)}, Why{G1063}, what{G5101} evil{G2556} hath he done{G4160}{(G5656)}? But{G1161} they cried out{G2896}{(G5707)} the more{G4057}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Let him be crucified{G4717}{(G5682)}."
Matthew,27,24,"When{G1161} Pilate{G4091} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} that{G3754} he could prevail{G5623}{(G5719)} nothing{G3762}, but{G235} that rather{G3123} a tumult{G2351} was made{G1096}{(G5736)}, he took{G2983}{(G5631)} water{G5204}, and washed{G633}{(G5668)} his hands{G5495} before{G561} the multitude{G3793}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} innocent{G121} of{G575} the blood{G129} of this{G5127} just person{G1342}: see{G3700}{(G5695)} ye{G5210} to it."
Matthew,27,25,"Then{G2532} answered{G611}{(G5679)} all{G3956} the people{G2992}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, His{G846} blood{G129} be on{G1909} us{G2248}, and{G2532} on{G1909} our{G2257} children{G5043}."
Matthew,27,26,"Then{G5119} released he{G630}{(G5656)} Barabbas{G912} unto them{G846}: and{G1161} when he had scourged{G5417}{(G5660)} Jesus{G2424}, he delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} him to{G2443} be crucified{G4717}{(G5686)}."
Matthew,27,27,"Then{G5119} the soldiers{G4757} of the governor{G2232} took{G3880}{(G5631)} Jesus{G2424} into{G1519} the common hall{G4232}, and gathered{G4863}{(G5627)} unto{G1909} him{G846} the whole{G3650} band{G4686} of soldiers."
Matthew,27,28,"And{G2532} they stripped{G1562}{(G5660)} him{G846}, and put on{G4060}{(G5656)} him{G846} a scarlet{G2847} robe{G5511}."
Matthew,27,29,"And{G2532} when they had platted{G4120}{(G5660)} a crown{G4735} of{G1537} thorns{G173}, they put{G2007}{(G5656)} it upon{G1909} his{G846} head{G2776}, and{G2532} a reed{G2563} in{G1909} his{G846} right hand{G1188}: and{G2532} they bowed the knee{G1120}{(G5660)} before{G1715} him{G846}, and mocked{G1702}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Hail{G5463}{(G5720)}, King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}!"
Matthew,27,30,"And{G2532} they spit{G1716}{(G5660)} upon{G1519} him{G846}, and took{G2983}{(G5627)} the reed{G2563}, and{G2532} smote{G5180}{(G5707)} him{G846} on{G1519} the head{G2776}."
Matthew,27,31,"And{G2532} after{G3753} that they had mocked{G1702}{(G5656)} him{G846}, they took{G1562} the robe{G5511} off{G1562}{(G5656)} from him{G846}, and{G2532} put{G1746} his own{G846} raiment{G2440} on{G1746}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} led{G520} him{G846} away{G520}{(G5627)} to{G1519} crucify{G4717}{(G5658)} him."
Matthew,27,32,"And{G1161} as they came out{G1831}{(G5740)}, they found{G2147}{(G5627)} a man{G444} of Cyrene{G2956}, Simon{G4613} by name{G3686}: him{G5126} they compelled{G29}{(G5656)} to{G2443} bear{G142}{(G5661)} his{G846} cross{G4716}."
Matthew,27,33,"And{G2532} when they were come{G2064}{(G5631)} unto{G1519} a place{G5117} called{G3004}{(G5746)} Golgotha{G1115}, that{G3739} is{G2076}{(G5748)} to say{G3004}{(G5746)}, a place{G5117} of a skull{G2898},"

Matthew,27,65,"{G1161} Pilate{G4091} said{G5346}{(G5713)} unto them{G846}, Ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} a watch{G2892}: go your way{G5217}{(G5720)}, make it as sure{G805}{(G5663)} as{G5613} ye can{G1492}{(G5758)}."
Matthew,27,66,"So{G1161} they went{G4198}{(G5679)}, and made{G805} the sepulchre{G5028} sure{G805}{(G5662)}, sealing{G4972}{(G5660)} the stone{G3037}, and setting{G3326} a watch{G2892}."

Mark,1,17,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Come ye{G1205}{(G5773)} after{G3694} me{G3450}, and{G2532} I will make{G4160}{(G5692)} you{G5209} to become{G1096}{(G5635)} fishers{G231} of men{G444}."
Mark,1,18,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} they forsook{G863}{(G5631)} their{G846} nets{G1350}, and followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Mark,1,19,"And{G2532} when he had gone{G4260} a little{G3641} further{G4260}{(G5631)} thence{G1564}, he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} James{G2385} the son{G3588} of Zebedee{G2199}, and{G2532} John{G2491} his{G846} brother{G80}, who{G846} also{G2532} were in{G1722} the ship{G4143} mending{G2675}{(G5723)} their nets{G1350}."
Mark,1,20,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} he called{G2564}{(G5656)} them{G846}: and{G2532} they left{G863}{(G5631)} their{G846} father{G3962} Zebedee{G2199} in{G1722} the ship{G4143} with{G3326} the hired servants{G3411}, and went{G565}{(G5627)} after{G3694} him{G846}."
Mark,1,21,"And{G2532} they went{G1531}{(G5736)} into{G1519} Capernaum{G2584}; and{G2532} straightway{G2112} on the sabbath day{G4521} he entered{G1525}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the synagogue{G4864}, and taught{G1321}{(G5707)}."
Mark,1,22,"And{G2532} they were astonished{G1605}{(G5712)} at{G1909} his{G846} doctrine{G1322}: for{G1063} he taught{G1321}{(G5723)}{G2258}{(G5713)} them{G846} as{G5613} one that had{G2192}{(G5723)} authority{G1849}, and{G2532} not{G3756} as{G5613} the scribes{G1122}."
Mark,1,23,"And{G2532} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} their{G846} synagogue{G4864} a man{G444} with{G1722} an unclean{G169} spirit{G4151}; and{G2532} he cried out{G349}{(G5656)},"
Mark,1,24,"Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Let us alone{G1436}; what{G5101} have we{G2254} to do{G2532} with thee{G4671}, thou Jesus{G2424} of Nazareth{G3479}? art thou come{G2064}{(G5627)} to destroy{G622}{(G5658)} us{G2248}? I know{G1492}{(G5758)} thee{G4571} who{G5101} thou art{G1488}{(G5748)}, the Holy One{G40} of God{G2316}."
Mark,1,25,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Hold thy peace{G5392}{(G5682)}, and{G2532} come{G1831}{(G5628)} out of{G1537} him{G846}."
Mark,1,26,"And{G2532} when the unclean{G169} spirit{G4151} had torn{G4682}{(G5660)} him{G846}, and{G2532} cried{G2896}{(G5660)} with a loud{G3173} voice{G5456}, he came{G1831}{(G5627)} out of{G1537} him{G846}."
Mark,1,27,"And{G2532} they were{G2284} all{G3956} amazed{G2284}{(G5681)}, insomuch that{G5620} they questioned{G4802}{(G5721)} among{G4314} themselves{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, What thing{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778}? what{G5101} new{G2537} doctrine{G1322} is this{G5124}? for{G3754} with{G2596} authority{G1849} commandeth{G2004}{(G5719)} he even{G2532} the unclean{G169} spirits{G4151}, and{G2532} they do obey{G5219}{(G5719)} him{G846}."
Mark,1,28,And{G1161} immediately{G2117} his{G846} fame{G189} spread abroad{G1831}{(G5627)} throughout{G1519} all{G3650} the region round about{G4066} Galilee{G1056}.
Mark,1,29,"And{G2532} forthwith{G2112}, when they were come{G1831}{(G5631)} out of{G1537} the synagogue{G4864}, they entered{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the house{G3614} of Simon{G4613} and{G2532} Andrew{G406}, with{G3326} James{G2385} and{G2532} John{G2491}."
Mark,1,30,"But{G1161} Simon's{G4613} wife's mother{G3994} lay{G2621}{(G5711)} sick of a fever{G4445}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} anon{G2112} they tell{G3004}{(G5719)} him{G846} of{G4012} her{G846}."
Mark,1,31,"And{G2532} he came{G4334}{(G5631)} and took{G2902}{(G5660)} her{G846} by the hand{G5495}, and lifted{G1453} her{G846} up{G1453}{(G5656)}; and{G2532} immediately{G2112} the fever{G4446} left{G863}{(G5656)} her{G846}, and{G2532} she ministered{G1247}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}."
Mark,1,32,"And{G1161} at{G1096}{(G5637)} even{G3798}, when{G3753} the sun{G2246} did set{G1416}{(G5627)}, they brought{G5342}{(G5707)} unto{G4314} him{G846} all{G3956} that were{G2192}{(G5723)} diseased{G2560}, and{G2532} them that were possessed with devils{G1139}{(G5740)}."
Mark,1,33,And{G2532} all{G3650} the city{G4172} was{G2258}{(G5713)} gathered together{G1996}{(G5772)} at{G4314} the door{G2374}.
Mark,1,34,"And{G2532} he healed{G2323}{(G5656)} many{G4183} that were{G2192}{(G5723)} sick{G2560} of divers{G4164} diseases{G3554}, and{G2532} cast out{G1544}{(G5627)} many{G4183} devils{G1140}; and{G2532} suffered{G863}{(G5707)} not{G3756} the devils{G1140} to speak{G2980}{(G5721)}, because{G3754} they knew{G1492}{(G5715)} him{G846}."
Mark,1,35,"And{G2532} in the morning{G4404}, rising up{G450}{(G5631)} a great while{G3029} before day{G1773}, he went out{G1831}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} departed{G565}{(G5627)} into{G1519} a solitary{G2048} place{G5117}, and there{G2546} prayed{G4336}{(G5711)}."
Mark,1,36,And{G2532} Simon{G4613} and{G2532} they that were with{G3326} him{G846} followed after{G2614}{(G5656)} him{G846}.
Mark,1,37,"And{G2532} when they had found{G2147}{(G5631)} him{G846}, they said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846},{G3754} All{G3956} men seek{G2212}{(G5719)} for thee{G4571}."
Mark,1,38,"And{G2532} he said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Let us go{G71}{(G5725)} into{G1519} the next{G2192}{(G5746)} towns{G2969}, that{G2443} I may preach{G2784}{(G5661)} there also{G2546}: for{G1063} therefore{G1519}{G5124} came I forth{G1831}{(G5758)}."
Mark,1,39,"And{G2532} he preached{G2784}{(G5723)}{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} their{G846} synagogues{G4864} throughout{G1519} all{G3650} Galilee{G1056}, and{G2532} cast out{G1544}{(G5723)} devils{G1140}."
Mark,1,40,"And{G2532} there came{G2064}{(G5736)} a leper{G3015} to{G4314} him{G846}, beseeching{G3870}{(G5723)} him{G846}, and{G2532} kneeling down{G1120}{(G5723)} to him{G846}, and{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)} unto him{G846},{G3754} If{G1437} thou wilt{G2309}{(G5725)}, thou canst{G1410}{(G5736)} make{G2511} me{G3165} clean{G2511}{(G5658)}."
Mark,1,41,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424}, moved with compassion{G4697}{(G5679)}, put forth{G1614}{(G5660)} his hand{G5495}, and touched{G680}{(G5662)} him{G846}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, I will{G2309}{(G5719)}; be thou clean{G2511}{(G5682)}."
Mark,1,42,"And{G2532} as soon as he{G846} had spoken{G2036}{(G5631)}, immediately{G2112} the leprosy{G3014} departed{G565}{(G5627)} from{G575} him{G846}, and{G2532} he was cleansed{G2511}{(G5681)}."
Mark,1,43,"And{G2532} he straitly charged{G1690}{(G5666)} him{G846}, and forthwith{G2112} sent{G1544} him{G846} away{G1544}{(G5627)};"
Mark,1,44,"And{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, See{G3708}{(G5720)} thou say{G2036}{(G5632)} nothing{G3367} to any man{G3367}: but{G235} go thy way{G5217}{(G5720)}, shew{G1166}{(G5657)} thyself{G4572} to the priest{G2409}, and{G2532} offer{G4374}{(G5628)} for{G4012} thy{G4675} cleansing{G2512} those things{G3739} which Moses{G3475} commanded{G4367}{(G5656)}, for{G1519} a testimony{G3142} unto them{G846}."
Mark,1,45,"But{G1161} he went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and began{G756}{(G5662)} to publish{G2784}{(G5721)} it much{G4183}, and{G2532} to blaze abroad{G1310}{(G5721)} the matter{G3056}, insomuch that{G5620} Jesus{G846} could{G1410}{(G5738)} no more{G3371} openly{G5320} enter{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} the city{G4172}, but{G235} was{G2258}{(G5713)} without{G1854} in{G1722} desert{G2048} places{G5117}: and{G2532} they came{G2064}{(G5711)} to{G4314} him{G846} from every quarter{G3836}."
Mark,2,1,And{G2532} again{G3825} he entered{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} Capernaum{G2584} after{G1223} some days{G2250}; and{G2532} it was noised{G191}{(G5681)} that{G3754} he was{G2076}{(G5748)} in{G1519} the house{G3624}.
Mark,2,2,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} many{G4183} were gathered together{G4863}{(G5681)}, insomuch that{G5620} there was{G5562} no{G3371} room to receive{G5562}{(G5721)} them, no, not so much{G3366} as about{G4314} the door{G2374}: and{G2532} he preached{G2980}{(G5707)} the word{G3056} unto them{G846}."
Mark,2,3,"And{G2532} they come{G2064}{(G5736)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, bringing{G5342}{(G5723)} one sick of the palsy{G3885}, which was borne{G142}{(G5746)} of{G5259} four{G5064}."
Mark,2,4,"And{G2532} when they could{G1410}{(G5740)} not{G3361} come nigh{G4331}{(G5658)} unto him{G846} for{G1223} the press{G3793}, they uncovered{G648}{(G5656)} the roof{G4721} where{G3699} he was{G2258}{(G5713)}: and{G2532} when they had broken it up{G1846}{(G5660)}, they let down{G5465}{(G5719)} the bed{G2895} wherein{G1909}{G3739} the sick of the palsy{G3885} lay{G2621}{(G5711)}."
Mark,2,5,"When{G1161} Jesus{G2424} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} their{G846} faith{G4102}, he said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto the sick of the palsy{G3885}, Son{G5043}, thy{G4675} sins{G266} be forgiven{G863}{(G5769)} thee{G4671}."
Mark,2,6,"But{G1161} there were{G2258}{(G5713)} certain{G5100} of the scribes{G1122} sitting{G2521}{(G5740)} there{G1563}, and{G2532} reasoning{G1260}{(G5740)} in{G1722} their{G846} hearts{G2588},"
Mark,2,7,Why{G5101} doth{G2980} this{G3778} man thus{G3779} speak{G2980}{(G5719)} blasphemies{G988}? who{G5101} can{G1410}{(G5736)} forgive{G863}{(G5721)} sins{G266} but{G1508} God{G2316} only{G1520}?
Mark,2,8,"And{G2532} immediately{G2112} when Jesus{G2424} perceived{G1921}{(G5631)} in his{G846} spirit{G4151} that{G3754} they so{G3779} reasoned{G1260}{(G5736)} within{G1722} themselves{G1438}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} reason ye{G1260}{(G5736)} these things{G5023} in{G1722} your{G5216} hearts{G2588}?"
Mark,2,9,"Whether{G5101} is it{G2076}{(G5748)} easier{G2123} to say{G2036}{(G5629)} to the sick of the palsy{G3885}, Thy sins{G266} be forgiven{G863}{(G5769)} thee{G4671}; or{G2228} to say{G2036}{(G5629)}, Arise{G1453}{(G5669)}, and{G2532} take up{G142}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} bed{G2895}, and{G2532} walk{G4043}{(G5720)}?"

Mark,4,37,"And{G2532} there arose{G1096}{(G5736)} a great{G3173} storm{G2978} of wind{G417}, and{G1161} the waves{G2949} beat{G1911}{(G5707)} into{G1519} the ship{G4143}, so that{G5620} it{G846} was{G1072} now{G2235} full{G1072}{(G5745)}."
Mark,4,38,"And{G2532} he{G846} was{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1909} the hinder part of the ship{G4403}, asleep{G2518}{(G5723)} on{G1909} a pillow{G4344}: and{G2532} they awake{G1326}{(G5719)} him{G846}, and{G2532} say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Master{G1320}, carest{G3199}{(G5719)} thou{G4671} not{G3756} that{G3754} we perish{G622}{(G5731)}?"
Mark,4,39,"And{G2532} he arose{G1326}{(G5685)}, and rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} the wind{G417}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto the sea{G2281}, Peace{G4623}{(G5720)}, be still{G5392}{(G5770)}. And{G2532} the wind{G417} ceased{G2869}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} there was{G1096}{(G5633)} a great{G3173} calm{G1055}."
Mark,4,40,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} are ye{G2075}{(G5748)} so{G3779} fearful{G1169}? how is it{G4459} that ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} faith{G4102}?"
Mark,4,41,"And{G2532} they feared{G5399}{(G5675)} exceedingly{G5401}{G3173}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)} one{G240} to{G4314} another{G240}, What{G5101} manner of man{G686} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778}, that{G3754} even{G2532} the wind{G417} and{G2532} the sea{G2281} obey{G5219}{(G5719)} him{G846}?"
Mark,5,1,"And{G2532} they came over{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G1519} the other side{G4008} of the sea{G2281}, into{G1519} the country{G5561} of the Gadarenes{G1046}."
Mark,5,2,"And{G2532} when he{G846} was come{G1831}{(G5631)} out of{G1537} the ship{G4143}, immediately{G2112} there met{G528}{(G5656)} him{G846} out of{G1537} the tombs{G3419} a man{G444} with{G1722} an unclean{G169} spirit{G4151},"

Mark,5,4,"Because{G1223} that he{G846} had been often{G4178} bound{G1210}{(G5771)} with fetters{G3976} and{G2532} chains{G254}, and{G2532} the chains{G254} had been plucked asunder{G1288}{(G5771)} by{G5259} him{G846}, and{G2532} the fetters{G3976} broken in pieces{G4937}{(G5771)}: neither{G2532} could{G2480}{(G5707)} any man tame{G1150}{(G5658)} him{G846}{G3762}."
Mark,5,5,"And{G2532} always{G1275}, night{G3571} and{G2532} day{G2250}, he was{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} the mountains{G3735}, and{G2532} in{G1722} the tombs{G3418}, crying{G2896}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} cutting{G2629}{(G5723)} himself{G1438} with stones{G3037}."
Mark,5,6,"But{G1161} when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} Jesus{G2424} afar off{G575}{G3113}, he ran{G5143}{(G5627)} and{G2532} worshipped{G4352}{(G5656)} him{G846},"
Mark,5,7,"And{G2532} cried{G2896}{(G5660)} with a loud{G3173} voice{G5456}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, What{G5101} have I{G1698} to do{G2532} with thee{G4671}, Jesus{G2424}, thou Son{G5207} of the most high{G5310} God{G2316}? I adjure{G3726}{(G5719)} thee{G4571} by God{G2316}, that thou torment{G928}{(G5661)} me{G3165} not{G3361}."
Mark,5,8,"For{G1063} he said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, Come{G1831}{(G5628)} out of{G1537} the man{G444}, thou unclean{G169} spirit{G4151}."
Mark,5,9,"And{G2532} he asked{G1905}{(G5707)} him{G846}, What{G5101} is thy{G4671} name{G3686}? And{G2532} he answered{G611}{(G5662)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, My{G3427} name{G3686} is Legion{G3003}: for{G3754} we are{G2070}{(G5748)} many{G4183}."
Mark,5,10,And{G2532} he besought{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} much{G4183} that{G3363} he would{G649} not{G3363} send{G649} them{G846} away{G649}{(G5661)} out of{G1854} the country{G5561}.
Mark,5,11,Now{G1161} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} there{G1563} nigh{G4314} unto the mountains{G3735} a great{G3173} herd{G34} of swine{G5519} feeding{G1006}{(G5746)}.
Mark,5,12,"And{G2532} all{G3956} the devils{G1142} besought{G3870}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Send{G3992}{(G5657)} us{G2248} into{G1519} the swine{G5519}, that{G2443} we may enter{G1525}{(G5632)} into{G1519} them{G846}."
Mark,5,13,"And{G2532} forthwith{G2112} Jesus{G2424} gave{G2010} them{G846} leave{G2010}{(G5656)}. And{G2532} the unclean{G169} spirits{G4151} went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and entered{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the swine{G5519}: and{G2532} the herd{G34} ran{G3729}{(G5656)} violently down{G2596} a steep place{G2911} into{G1519} the sea{G2281},{G1161}(they were{G2258}{(G5713)} about{G5613} two thousand{G1367};) and{G2532} were choked{G4155}{(G5712)} in{G1722} the sea{G2281}."
Mark,5,14,"And{G1161} they that fed{G1006}{(G5723)} the swine{G5519} fled{G5343}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} told{G312}{(G5656)} it in{G1519} the city{G4172}, and{G2532} in{G1519} the country{G68}. And{G2532} they went out{G1831}{(G5627)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} what{G5101} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} that was done{G1096}{(G5756)}."
Mark,5,15,"And{G2532} they come{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G4314} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} see{G2334}{(G5719)} him that was possessed with the devil{G1139}{(G5740)}, and had{G2192}{(G5761)} the legion{G3003}, sitting{G2521}{(G5740)}, and{G2532} clothed{G2439}{(G5772)}, and{G2532} in his right mind{G4993}{(G5723)}: and{G2532} they were afraid{G5399}{(G5675)}."
Mark,5,16,"And{G2532} they that saw{G1492}{(G5631)} it told{G1334}{(G5662)} them{G846} how{G4459} it befell{G1096}{(G5633)} to him that was possessed with the devil{G1139}{(G5740)}, and{G2532} also concerning{G4012} the swine{G5519}."
Mark,5,17,And{G2532} they began{G756}{(G5662)} to pray{G3870}{(G5721)} him{G846} to depart{G565}{(G5629)} out of{G575} their{G846} coasts{G3725}.
Mark,5,18,"And{G2532} when he{G846} was come{G1684}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the ship{G4143}, he that had been possessed with the devil{G1139}{(G5679)} prayed{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} that{G2443} he might be{G5600}{(G5753)} with{G3326} him{G846}."
Mark,5,19,"Howbeit{G1161} Jesus{G2424} suffered{G863}{(G5656)} him{G846} not{G3756}, but{G235} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Go{G5217}{(G5720)} home{G1519}{G3624}{G4675} to{G4314} thy friends{G4674}, and{G2532} tell{G312}{(G5657)} them{G846} how great things{G3745} the Lord{G2962} hath done{G4160}{(G5656)} for thee{G4671}, and{G2532} hath had compassion{G1653}{(G5656)} on thee{G4571}."
Mark,5,20,"And{G2532} he departed{G565}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} began{G756}{(G5662)} to publish{G2784}{(G5721)} in{G1722} Decapolis{G1179} how great things{G3745} Jesus{G2424} had done{G4160}{(G5656)} for him{G846}: and{G2532} all{G3956} men did marvel{G2296}{(G5707)}."
Mark,5,21,"And{G2532} when Jesus{G2424} was passed over{G1276}{(G5660)} again{G3825} by{G1722} ship{G4143} unto{G1519} the other side{G4008}, much{G4183} people{G3793} gathered{G4863}{(G5681)} unto{G1909} him{G846}: and{G2532} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} nigh{G3844} unto the sea{G2281}."
Mark,5,22,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, there cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} one{G1520} of the rulers of the synagogue{G752}, Jairus{G2383} by name{G3686}; and{G2532} when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846}, he fell{G4098}{(G5719)} at{G4314} his{G846} feet{G4228},"
Mark,5,23,"And{G2532} besought{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} greatly{G4183}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} My{G3450} little daughter{G2365} lieth{G2079} at the point of death{G2192}{(G5719)}: I pray thee, come{G2064}{(G5631)} and{G2443} lay{G2007}{(G5632)} thy hands{G5495} on her{G846}, that{G3704} she may be healed{G4982}{(G5686)}; and{G2532} she shall live{G2198}{(G5695)}."
Mark,5,24,"And{G2532} Jesus went{G565}{(G5627)} with{G3326} him{G846}; and{G2532} much{G4183} people{G3793} followed{G190}{(G5707)} him{G846}, and{G2532} thronged{G4918}{(G5707)} him{G846}."
Mark,5,25,"And{G2532} a certain{G5100} woman{G1135}, which had an{G1722} issue{G4511} of blood{G129}{G5607}{(G5752)} twelve{G1427} years{G2094},"

Mark,5,27,"When she had heard{G191}{(G5660)} of{G4012} Jesus{G2424}, came{G2064}{(G5631)} in{G1722} the press{G3793} behind{G3693}, and touched{G680}{(G5662)} his{G846} garment{G2440}."
Mark,5,28,"For{G1063} she said{G3004}{(G5707)}, If{G3754}{G2579} I may touch{G680}{(G5672)} but{G2579} his{G846} clothes{G2440}, I shall be whole{G4982}{(G5701)}."
Mark,5,29,And{G2532} straightway{G2112} the fountain{G4077} of her{G846} blood{G129} was dried up{G3583}{(G5681)}; and{G2532} she felt{G1097}{(G5627)} in her body{G4983} that{G3754} she was healed{G2390}{(G5769)} of{G575} that plague{G3148}.
Mark,5,30,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424}, immediately{G2112} knowing{G1921}{(G5631)} in{G1722} himself{G1438} that virtue{G1411} had gone{G1831}{(G5631)} out of{G1537} him{G846}, turned him about{G1994}{(G5651)} in{G1722} the press{G3793}, and said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Who{G5101} touched{G680}{(G5662)} my{G3450} clothes{G2440}?"
Mark,5,31,"And{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, Thou seest{G991}{(G5719)} the multitude{G3793} thronging{G4918}{(G5723)} thee{G4571}, and{G2532} sayest thou{G3004}{(G5719)}, Who{G5101} touched{G680}{(G5662)} me{G3450}?"
Mark,5,32,And{G2532} he looked round about{G4017}{(G5710)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} her that had done{G4160}{(G5660)} this thing{G5124}.
Mark,5,33,"But{G1161} the woman{G1135} fearing{G5399}{(G5679)} and{G2532} trembling{G5141}{(G5723)}, knowing{G1492}{(G5761)} what{G3739} was done{G1096}{(G5754)} in{G1909} her{G846}, came{G2064}{(G5627)} and{G2532} fell down before{G4363}{(G5627)} him{G846}, and{G2532} told{G2036}{(G5627)} him{G846} all{G3956} the truth{G225}."
Mark,5,34,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, Daughter{G2364}, thy{G4675} faith{G4102} hath made{G4982} thee{G4571} whole{G4982}{(G5758)}; go{G5217}{(G5720)} in{G1519} peace{G1515}, and{G2532} be{G2468}{(G5749)} whole{G5199} of{G575} thy{G4675} plague{G3148}."
Mark,5,35,"While{G2089} he{G846} yet{G2089} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, there came{G2064}{(G5736)} from{G575} the ruler of the synagogue's{G752} house certain which said{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} Thy{G4675} daughter{G2364} is dead{G599}{(G5627)}: why{G5101} troublest thou{G4660}{(G5719)} the Master{G1320} any further{G2089}?"
Mark,5,36,"As soon as{G1161}{G2112} Jesus{G2424} heard{G191}{(G5660)} the word{G3056} that was spoken{G2980}{(G5746)}, he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto the ruler of the synagogue{G752}, Be{G5399} not{G3361} afraid{G5399}{(G5737)}, only{G3440} believe{G4100}{(G5720)}."
Mark,5,37,"And{G2532} he suffered{G863}{(G5656)}{G3756} no man{G3762} to follow{G4870}{(G5658)} him{G846}, save{G1508} Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} James{G2385}, and{G2532} John{G2491} the brother{G80} of James{G2385}."
Mark,5,38,"And{G2532} he cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G1519} the house{G3624} of the ruler of the synagogue{G752}, and{G2532} seeth{G2334}{(G5719)} the tumult{G2351}, and them that wept{G2799}{(G5723)} and{G2532} wailed{G214}{(G5723)} greatly{G4183}."
Mark,5,39,"And{G2532} when he was come in{G1525}{(G5631)}, he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} make ye this ado{G2350}{(G5743)}, and{G2532} weep{G2799}{(G5719)}? the damsel{G3813} is{G599} not{G3756} dead{G599}{(G5627)}, but{G235} sleepeth{G2518}{(G5719)}."
Mark,5,40,"And{G2532} they laughed{G2606} him{G846} to scorn{G2606}{(G5707)}.

Mark,5,41,"And{G2532} he took{G2902}{(G5660)} the damsel{G3813} by the hand{G5495}, and said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Talitha{G5008} cumi{G2891}; which{G3739} is{G2076}{(G5748)}, being interpreted{G3177}{(G5746)}, Damsel{G2877}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, arise{G1453}{(G5669)}."

Mark,5,43,And{G2532} he charged{G1291}{(G5668)} them{G846} straitly{G4183} that{G2443} no man{G3367} should know{G1097}{(G5632)} it{G5124}; and{G2532} commanded{G2036}{(G5627)} that something should be given{G1325}{(G5683)} her{G846} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}.
Mark,6,1,"And{G2532} he went out{G1831}{(G5627)} from thence{G1564}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} his own{G846} country{G3968}; and{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101} follow{G190}{(G5719)} him{G846}."
Mark,6,2,"And{G2532} when the sabbath day{G4521} was come{G1096}{(G5637)}, he began{G756}{(G5662)} to teach{G1321}{(G5721)} in{G1722} the synagogue{G4864}: and{G2532} many{G4183} hearing{G191}{(G5723)} him were astonished{G1605}{(G5712)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, From whence{G4159} hath this{G5129} man these things{G5023}? and{G2532} what{G5101} wisdom{G4678} is this which is given{G1325}{(G5685)} unto him{G846}, that{G3754} even{G2532} such{G5108} mighty works{G1411} are wrought{G1096}{(G5736)} by{G1223} his{G846} hands{G5495}?"

Mark,6,6,"And{G2532} he marvelled{G2296}{(G5707)} because{G1223} of their{G846} unbelief{G570}. And{G2532} he went{G4013}{(G5707)} round about{G2945} the villages{G2968}, teaching{G1321}{(G5723)}."
Mark,6,7,"And{G2532} he called{G4341}{(G5736)} unto him the twelve{G1427}, and{G2532} began{G756}{(G5662)} to send{G649} them{G846} forth{G649}{(G5721)} by two{G1417} and two{G1417}; and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5707)} them{G846} power over{G1849} unclean{G169} spirits{G4151};"

Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, It shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} more tolerable{G414} for Sodom{G4670} and{G2228} Gomorrha{G1116} in{G1722} the day{G2250} of judgment{G2920}, than{G2228} for that{G1565} city{G4172}."
Mark,6,12,"And{G2532} they went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and preached{G2784}{(G5707)} that{G2443} men should repent{G3340}{(G5661)}."
Mark,6,13,"And{G2532} they cast out{G1544}{(G5707)} many{G4183} devils{G1140}, and{G2532} anointed{G218}{(G5707)} with oil{G1637} many{G4183} that were sick{G732}, and{G2532} healed{G2323}{(G5707)} them."
Mark,6,14,"And{G2532} king{G935} Herod{G2264} heard{G191}{(G5656)} of him;(for{G1063} his{G846} name{G3686} was{G1096}{(G5633)} spread abroad{G5318}:) and{G2532} he said{G3004}{(G5707)}, That{G3754} John{G2491} the Baptist{G907}{(G5723)} was risen{G1453}{(G5681)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}, and{G2532} therefore{G1223}{G5124} mighty works{G1411} do shew forth themselves{G1754}{(G5719)} in{G1722} him{G846}."

Mark,6,37,"He answered{G611}{(G5679)} and{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Give{G1325}{(G5628)} ye{G5210} them{G846} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}. And{G2532} they say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Shall we go{G565}{(G5631)} and buy{G59}{(G5661)} two hundred{G1250} pennyworth{G1220} of bread{G740}, and{G2532} give{G1325}{(G5632)} them{G846} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}?"
Mark,6,38,"{G1161} He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, How many{G4214} loaves{G740} have ye{G2192}{(G5719)}? go{G5217}{(G5720)} and{G2532} see{G1492}{(G5628)}. And{G2532} when they knew{G1097}{(G5631)}, they say{G3004}{(G5719)}, Five{G4002}, and{G2532} two{G1417} fishes{G2486}."
Mark,6,39,And{G2532} he commanded{G2004}{(G5656)} them{G846} to make{G347} all{G3956} sit down{G347}{(G5658)} by companies{G4849}{G4849} upon{G1909} the green{G5515} grass{G5528}.
Mark,6,40,"And{G2532} they sat down{G377}{(G5627)} in ranks{G4237}{G4237}, by{G303} hundreds{G1540}, and{G2532} by{G303} fifties{G4004}."
Mark,6,41,"And{G2532} when he had taken{G2983}{(G5631)} the five{G4002} loaves{G740} and{G2532} the two{G1417} fishes{G2486}, he looked up{G308}{(G5660)} to{G1519} heaven{G3772}, and blessed{G2127}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} brake{G2622}{(G5656)} the loaves{G740}, and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5707)} them to his{G846} disciples{G3101} to{G2443} set before{G3908}{(G5632)} them{G846}; and{G2532} the two{G1417} fishes{G2486} divided he{G3307}{(G5656)} among them all{G3956}."
Mark,6,42,"And{G2532} they did{G5315} all{G3956} eat{G5315}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} were filled{G5526}{(G5681)}."
Mark,6,43,"And{G2532} they took up{G142}{(G5656)} twelve{G1427} baskets{G2894} full{G4134} of the fragments{G2801}, and{G2532} of{G575} the fishes{G2486}."
Mark,6,44,And{G2532} they that did eat{G5315}{(G5631)} of the loaves{G740} were{G2258}{(G5713)} about{G5616} five thousand{G4000} men{G435}.
Mark,6,45,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} he constrained{G315}{(G5656)} his{G846} disciples{G3101} to get{G1684}{(G5629)} into{G1519} the ship{G4143}, and{G2532} to go{G4254} to{G1519} the other side{G4008} before{G4254}{(G5721)} unto{G4314} Bethsaida{G966}, while{G2193} he{G846} sent away{G630}{(G5661)} the people{G3793}."

Mark,6,47,"And{G2532} when even{G3798} was come{G1096}{(G5637)}, the ship{G4143} was{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} the midst{G3319} of the sea{G2281}, and{G2532} he{G846} alone{G3441} on{G1909} the land{G1093}."
Mark,6,48,"And{G2532} he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} them{G846} toiling{G928}{(G5746)} in{G1722} rowing{G1643}{(G5721)}; for{G1063} the wind{G417} was{G2258}{(G5713)} contrary{G1727} unto them{G846}: and{G2532} about{G4012} the fourth{G5067} watch{G5438} of the night{G3571} he cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, walking{G4043}{(G5723)} upon{G1909} the sea{G2281}, and{G2532} would{G2309}{(G5707)} have passed by{G3928}{(G5629)} them{G846}."

Mark,6,52,For{G1063} they considered{G4920}{(G5656)} not{G3756} the miracle of{G1909} the loaves{G740}: for{G1063} their{G846} heart{G2588} was{G2258}{(G5713)} hardened{G4456}{(G5772)}.

Mark,8,28,"And{G1161} they answered{G611}{(G5662)}, John{G2491} the Baptist{G910}: but{G1161} some{G243} say, Elias{G2243}; and{G2532} others{G243}, One{G1520} of the prophets{G4396}."
Mark,8,29,"And{G2532} he{G846} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, But{G1161} whom{G5101} say{G3004}{(G5719)} ye{G5210} that I{G3165} am{G1511}{(G5750)}? And{G1161} Peter{G4074} answereth{G611}{(G5679)} and saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} the Christ{G5547}."
Mark,8,30,And{G2532} he charged{G2008}{(G5656)} them{G846} that{G2443} they should tell{G3004}{(G5725)} no man{G3367} of{G4012} him{G846}.
Mark,8,31,"And{G2532} he began{G756}{(G5662)} to teach{G1321}{(G5721)} them{G846}, that{G3754} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} must{G1163}{(G5748)} suffer{G3958}{(G5629)} many things{G4183}, and{G2532} be rejected{G593}{(G5683)} of{G575} the elders{G4245}, and{G2532} of the chief priests{G749}, and{G2532} scribes{G1122}, and{G2532} be killed{G615}{(G5683)}, and{G2532} after{G3326} three{G5140} days{G2250} rise again{G450}{(G5629)}."
Mark,8,32,"And{G2532} he spake{G2980}{(G5707)} that saying{G3056} openly{G3954}. And{G2532} Peter{G4074} took{G4355}{(G5642)} him{G846}, and began{G756}{(G5662)} to rebuke{G2008}{(G5721)} him{G846}."
Mark,8,33,"But{G1161} when he had turned about{G1994}{(G5651)} and{G2532} looked{G1492}{(G5631)} on his{G846} disciples{G3101}, he rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} Peter{G4074}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Get thee{G5217}{(G5720)} behind{G3694} me{G3450}, Satan{G4567}: for{G3754} thou savourest{G5426}{(G5719)} not{G3756} the things that be of God{G2316}, but{G235} the things that be of men{G444}."
Mark,8,34,"And{G2532} when he had called{G4341}{(G5666)} the people{G3793} unto him with{G4862} his{G846} disciples{G3101} also, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Whosoever{G3748} will{G2309}{(G5719)} come{G2064}{(G5629)} after{G3694} me{G3450}, let him deny{G533}{(G5663)} himself{G1438}, and{G2532} take up{G142}{(G5657)} his{G846} cross{G4716}, and{G2532} follow{G190}{(G5720)} me{G3427}."
Mark,8,35,"For{G1063} whosoever{G3739}{G302} will{G2309}{(G5725)} save{G4982}{(G5658)} his{G846} life{G5590} shall lose{G622}{(G5692)} it{G846}; but{G1161} whosoever{G3739}{G302} shall lose{G622}{(G5661)} his{G846} life{G5590} for{G1752} my sake{G1700} and{G2532} the gospel's{G2098}, the same{G3778} shall save{G4982}{(G5692)} it{G846}."
Mark,8,36,"For{G1063} what{G5101} shall it profit{G5623}{(G5692)} a man{G444}, if{G1437} he shall gain{G2770}{(G5661)} the whole{G3650} world{G2889}, and{G2532} lose{G2210}{(G5686)} his own{G846} soul{G5590}?"
Mark,8,37,Or{G2228} what{G5101} shall{G1325} a man{G444} give{G1325}{(G5692)} in exchange{G465} for his{G846} soul{G5590}?
Mark,8,38,"Whosoever{G3739}{G302} therefore{G1063} shall be ashamed{G1870}{(G5680)} of me{G3165} and{G2532} of my{G1699} words{G3056} in{G1722} this{G5026} adulterous{G3428} and{G2532} sinful{G268} generation{G1074}; of him{G846} also{G2532} shall{G1870} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} be ashamed{G1870}{(G5700)}, when{G3752} he cometh{G2064}{(G5632)} in{G1722} the glory{G1391} of his{G846} Father{G3962} with{G3326} the holy{G40} angels{G32}."
Mark,9,1,"And{G2532} he said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} there be{G1526}{(G5748)} some{G5100} of them that stand{G2476}{(G5761)} here{G5602}, which{G3748} shall{G1089} not{G3364} taste{G1089}{(G5667)} of death{G2288}, till{G2193}{G302} they have seen{G1492}{(G5632)} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316} come{G2064}{(G5756)} with{G1722} power{G1411}."
Mark,9,2,"And{G2532} after{G3326} six{G1803} days{G2250} Jesus{G2424} taketh{G3880}{(G5719)} with him Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} James{G2385}, and{G2532} John{G2491}, and{G2532} leadeth{G399} them{G846} up{G399}{(G5719)} into{G1519} an high{G5308} mountain{G3735} apart{G2596}{G2398} by themselves{G3441}: and{G2532} he was transfigured{G3339}{(G5681)} before{G1715} them{G846}."
Mark,9,3,"And{G2532} his{G846} raiment{G2440} became{G1096}{(G5633)} shining{G4744}{(G5723)}, exceeding{G3029} white{G3022} as{G5613} snow{G5510}; so as{G3634} no{G3756} fuller{G1102} on{G1909} earth{G1093} can{G1410}{(G5736)} white{G3021}{(G5658)} them."
Mark,9,4,And{G2532} there appeared{G3700}{(G5681)} unto them{G846} Elias{G2243} with{G4862} Moses{G3475}: and{G2532} they were{G2258}{(G5713)} talking{G4814}{(G5723)} with Jesus{G2424}.
Mark,9,5,"And{G2532} Peter{G4074} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G3004}{(G5719)} to Jesus{G2424}, Master{G4461}, it is{G2076}{(G5748)} good{G2570} for us{G2248} to be{G1511}{(G5750)} here{G5602}: and{G2532} let us make{G4160}{(G5661)} three{G5140} tabernacles{G4633}; one{G3391} for thee{G4671}, and{G2532} one{G3391} for Moses{G3475}, and{G2532} one{G3391} for Elias{G2243}."
Mark,9,6,For{G1063} he wist{G1492}{(G5715)} not{G3756} what{G5101} to say{G2980}{(G5661)}; for{G1063} they were sore{G2258}{(G5713)} afraid{G1630}.
Mark,9,7,"And{G2532} there was{G1096}{(G5633)} a cloud{G3507} that overshadowed{G1982}{(G5723)} them{G846}: and{G2532} a voice{G5456} came{G2064}{(G5627)} out of{G1537} the cloud{G3507}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} my{G3450} beloved{G27} Son{G5207}: hear{G191}{(G5720)} him{G846}."
Mark,9,8,"And{G2532} suddenly{G1819}, when they had looked round about{G4017}{(G5671)}, they saw{G1492}{(G5627)} no man{G3762} any more{G3765}, save{G235} Jesus{G2424} only{G3441} with{G3326} themselves{G1438}."
Mark,9,9,"And{G1161} as they{G846} came down{G2597}{(G5723)} from{G575} the mountain{G3735}, he charged{G1291}{(G5668)} them{G846} that{G2443} they should tell{G1334}{(G5667)} no man{G3367} what things{G3739} they had seen{G1492}{(G5627)}, till{G1508}{G3752} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} were risen{G450}{(G5632)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}."
Mark,9,10,"And{G2532} they kept{G2902}{(G5656)} that saying{G3056} with{G4314} themselves{G1438}, questioning one with another{G4802}{(G5723)} what{G5101} the rising{G450}{(G5629)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498} should mean{G2076}{(G5748)}."
Mark,9,11,"And{G2532} they asked{G1905}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Why{G3754} say{G3004}{(G5719)} the scribes{G1122} that{G3754} Elias{G2243} must{G1163}{(G5748)} first{G4412} come{G2064}{(G5629)}?"
Mark,9,12,"And{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and told{G2036}{(G5627)} them{G846}, Elias{G2243} verily{G3303} cometh{G2064}{(G5631)} first{G4412}, and restoreth{G600}{(G5719)} all things{G3956}; and{G2532} how{G4459} it is written{G1125}{(G5769)} of{G1909} the Son{G5207} of man{G444}, that{G2443} he must suffer{G3958}{(G5632)} many things{G4183}, and{G2532} be set at nought{G1847}{(G5686)}."
Mark,9,13,"But{G235} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} Elias{G2243} is{G2064} indeed{G2532} come{G2064}{(G5754)}, and{G2532} they have done{G4160}{(G5656)} unto him{G846} whatsoever{G3745} they listed{G2309}{(G5656)}, as{G2531} it is written{G1125}{(G5769)} of{G1909} him{G846}."
Mark,9,14,"And{G2532} when he came{G2064}{(G5631)} to{G4314} his disciples{G3101}, he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} a great{G4183} multitude{G3793} about{G4012} them{G846}, and{G2532} the scribes{G1122} questioning{G4802}{(G5723)} with them{G846}."
Mark,9,15,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} all{G3956} the people{G3793}, when they beheld{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846}, were greatly amazed{G1568}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} running to{G4370}{(G5723)} him saluted{G782}{(G5711)} him{G846}."
Mark,9,16,"And{G2532} he asked{G1905}{(G5656)} the scribes{G1122}, What{G5101} question ye{G4802}{(G5719)} with{G4314} them{G846}?"
Mark,9,17,"And{G2532} one{G1520} of{G1537} the multitude{G3793} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Master{G1320}, I have brought{G5342}{(G5656)} unto{G4314} thee{G4571} my{G3450} son{G5207}, which hath{G2192}{(G5723)} a dumb{G216} spirit{G4151};"
Mark,9,18,"And{G2532} wheresoever{G3699}{G302} he taketh{G2638}{(G5632)} him{G846}, he teareth{G4486}{(G5719)} him{G846}: and{G2532} he foameth{G875}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} gnasheth{G5149}{(G5719)} with his{G846} teeth{G3599}, and{G2532} pineth away{G3583}{(G5743)}: and{G2532} I spake{G2036}{(G5627)} to thy{G4675} disciples{G3101} that{G2443} they should cast{G1544} him{G846} out{G1544}{(G5632)}; and{G2532} they could{G2480}{(G5656)} not{G3756}."
Mark,9,19,"He answereth{G611}{(G5679)} him{G846}, and{G1161} saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, O{G5599} faithless{G571} generation{G1074}, how long{G2193}{G4219} shall I be{G2071}{(G5704)} with{G4314} you{G5209}? how long{G2193}{G4219} shall I suffer{G430}{(G5695)} you{G5216}? bring{G5342}{(G5720)} him{G846} unto{G4314} me{G3165}."
Mark,9,20,"And{G2532} they brought{G5342}{(G5656)} him{G846} unto{G4314} him{G846}: and{G2532} when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846}, straightway{G2112} the spirit{G4151} tare{G4682}{(G5656)} him{G846}; and{G2532} he fell{G4098}{(G5631)} on{G1909} the ground{G1093}, and wallowed{G2947}{(G5709)} foaming{G875}{(G5723)}."
Mark,9,21,"And{G2532} he asked{G1905}{(G5656)} his{G846} father{G3962}, How long{G4214} is it{G2076}{(G5748)} ago{G5550} since{G5613} this{G5124} came{G1096}{(G5754)} unto him{G846}? And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Of a child{G3812}."
Mark,9,22,"And{G2532} ofttimes{G4178} it hath cast{G906}{(G5627)} him{G846} into{G2532}{G1519} the fire{G4442}, and{G2532} into{G1519} the waters{G5204}, to{G2443} destroy{G622}{(G5661)} him{G846}: but{G235} if{G1536} thou canst{G1410}{(G5736)} do any thing{G1536}, have compassion{G4697}{(G5679)} on{G1909} us{G2248}, and help{G997}{(G5657)} us{G2254}."
Mark,9,23,"{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, If{G1487} thou canst{G1410}{(G5736)} believe{G4100}{(G5658)}, all things{G3956} are possible{G1415} to him{G846} that believeth{G4100}{(G5723)}."
Mark,9,24,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} the father{G3962} of the child{G3813} cried out{G2896}{(G5660)}, and said{G3004}{(G5707)} with{G3326} tears{G1144}, Lord{G2962}, I believe{G4100}{(G5719)}; help thou{G997}{(G5720)} mine{G3450} unbelief{G570}."
Mark,9,25,"When{G1161} Jesus{G2424} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} that{G3754} the people{G3793} came running together{G1998}{(G5719)}, he rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} the foul{G169} spirit{G4151}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)} unto him{G846}, Thou dumb{G216} and{G2532} deaf{G2974} spirit{G4151}, I{G1473} charge{G2004}{(G5719)} thee{G4671}, come{G1831}{(G5628)} out of{G1537} him{G846}, and{G2532} enter{G1525}{(G5632)} no more{G3371} into{G1519} him{G846}."

Mark,9,27,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} took{G2902}{(G5660)} him{G846} by the hand{G5495}, and lifted{G1453} him{G846} up{G1453}{(G5656)}; and{G2532} he arose{G450}{(G5627)}."

Mark,9,30,"And{G2532} they departed{G1831}{(G5631)} thence{G1564}, and passed{G3899}{(G5711)} through{G1223} Galilee{G1056}; and{G2532} he would{G2309}{(G5707)} not{G3756} that{G2443} any man{G5100} should know{G1097}{(G5632)} it."
Mark,9,31,"For{G1063} he taught{G1321}{(G5707)} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto them{G846},{G3754} The Son{G5207} of man{G444} is delivered{G3860}{(G5743)} into{G1519} the hands{G5495} of men{G444}, and{G2532} they shall kill{G615}{(G5692)} him{G846}; and{G2532} after that he is killed{G615}{(G5685)}, he shall rise{G450}{(G5698)} the third{G5154} day{G2250}."
Mark,9,32,"But{G1161} they understood not{G50}{(G5707)} that saying{G4487}, and{G2532} were afraid{G5399}{(G5711)} to ask{G1905}{(G5658)} him{G846}."

Mark,14,3,"And{G2532} being{G846}{G5607}{(G5752)} in{G1722} Bethany{G963} in{G1722} the house{G3614} of Simon{G4613} the leper{G3015}, as he{G846} sat at meat{G2621}{(G5740)}, there came{G2064}{(G5627)} a woman{G1135} having{G2192}{(G5723)} an alabaster box{G211} of ointment{G3464} of spikenard{G3487}{G4101} very precious{G4185}; and{G2532} she brake{G4937}{(G5660)} the box{G211}, and poured{G2708}{(G5656)} it on{G2596} his{G846} head{G2776}."
Mark,14,4,"And{G1161} there were{G2258}{(G5713)} some{G5100} that had indignation{G23}{(G5723)} within{G4314} themselves{G1438}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5723)}, Why{G1519}{G5101} was{G1096} this{G3778} waste{G684} of the ointment{G3464} made{G1096}{(G5754)}?"
Mark,14,5,"For{G1063} it{G5124} might{G1410}{(G5711)} have been sold{G4097}{(G5683)} for more than{G1883} three hundred{G5145} pence{G1220}, and{G2532} have been given{G1325}{(G5683)} to the poor{G4434}. And{G2532} they murmured against{G1690}{(G5711)} her{G846}."
Mark,14,6,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Let{G863} her{G846} alone{G863}{(G5628)}; why{G5101} trouble ye{G2873}{G3930}{(G5719)} her{G846}? she hath wrought{G2038}{(G5662)} a good{G2570} work{G2041} on{G1519} me{G1691}."
Mark,14,7,"For{G1063} ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} the poor{G4434} with{G3326} you{G1438} always{G3842}, and{G2532} whensoever{G3752} ye will{G2309}{(G5725)} ye may{G1410}{(G5736)} do{G4160}{(G5658)} them{G846} good{G2095}: but{G1161} me{G1691} ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} not{G3756} always{G3842}."
Mark,14,8,She hath done{G4160}{(G5656)} what{G3739} she{G3778}{(G5625)}{G846} could{G2192}{(G5707)}: she is come aforehand{G4301}{(G5627)} to anoint{G3462}{(G5658)} my{G3450} body{G4983} to{G1519} the burying{G1780}.
Mark,14,9,"Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, Wheresoever{G3699}{G302} this{G5124} gospel{G2098} shall be preached{G2784}{(G5686)} throughout{G1519} the whole{G3650} world{G2889}, this also{G2532} that{G3739} she{G3778}{(G5625)}{G846} hath done{G4160}{(G5656)} shall be spoken{G2980}{(G5701)} of for{G1519} a memorial{G3422} of her{G846}."
Mark,14,10,"And{G2532} Judas{G2455} Iscariot{G2469}, one{G1520} of the twelve{G1427}, went{G565}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} the chief priests{G749}, to{G2443} betray{G3860}{(G5632)} him{G846} unto them{G846}."
Mark,14,11,"And{G1161} when they heard{G191}{(G5660)} it, they were glad{G5463}{(G5644)}, and{G2532} promised{G1861}{(G5673)} to give{G1325}{(G5629)} him{G846} money{G694}. And{G2532} he sought{G2212}{(G5707)} how{G4459} he might conveniently{G2122} betray{G3860}{(G5632)} him{G846}."
Mark,14,12,"And{G2532} the first{G4413} day{G2250} of unleavened bread{G106}, when{G3753} they killed{G2380}{(G5707)} the passover{G3957}, his{G846} disciples{G3101} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Where{G4226} wilt thou{G2309}{(G5719)} that we go{G565}{(G5631)} and prepare{G2090}{(G5661)} that{G2443} thou mayest eat{G5315}{(G5632)} the passover{G3957}?"
Mark,14,13,"And{G2532} he sendeth forth{G649}{(G5719)} two{G1417} of his{G846} disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Go ye{G5217}{(G5720)} into{G1519} the city{G4172}, and{G2532} there shall meet{G528}{(G5692)} you{G5213} a man{G444} bearing{G941}{(G5723)} a pitcher{G2765} of water{G5204}: follow{G190}{(G5657)} him{G846}."
Mark,14,14,"And{G2532} wheresoever{G3699}{G1437} he shall go in{G1525}{(G5632)}, say ye{G2036}{(G5628)} to the goodman of the house{G3617},{G3754} The Master{G1320} saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, Where{G4226} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the guestchamber{G2646}, where{G3699} I shall eat{G5315}{(G5632)} the passover{G3957} with{G3326} my{G3450} disciples{G3101}?"
Mark,14,15,And{G2532} he{G846} will shew{G1166}{(G5692)} you{G5213} a large{G3173} upper room{G508} furnished{G4766}{(G5772)} and prepared{G2092}: there{G1563} make ready{G2090}{(G5657)} for us{G2254}.
Mark,14,16,"And{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101} went forth{G1831}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the city{G4172}, and{G2532} found{G2147}{(G5627)} as{G2531} he had said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}: and{G2532} they made ready{G2090}{(G5656)} the passover{G3957}."
Mark,14,17,And{G2532} in{G1096}{(G5637)} the evening{G3798} he cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} with{G3326} the twelve{G1427}.
Mark,14,18,"And{G2532} as they{G846} sat{G345}{(G5740)} and{G2532} did eat{G2068}{(G5723)}, Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} One{G1520} of{G1537} you{G5216} which{G3588} eateth{G2068}{(G5723)} with{G3326} me{G1700} shall betray{G3860}{(G5692)} me{G3165}."
Mark,14,19,"And{G1161} they began{G756}{(G5662)} to be sorrowful{G3076}{(G5745)}, and to{G2532} say{G3004}{(G5721)} unto him{G846} one by one{G1527},{G3385} Is it I{G1473}? and{G2532} another{G243} said,{G3385} Is it I{G1473}?"
Mark,14,20,"And{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, It is one{G1520} of{G1537} the twelve{G1427}, that dippeth{G1686}{(G5734)} with{G3326} me{G1700} in{G1519} the dish{G5165}."
Mark,14,21,"The Son{G5207} of man{G444} indeed{G3303} goeth{G5217}{(G5719)}, as{G2531} it is written{G1125}{(G5769)} of{G4012} him{G846}: but{G1161} woe{G3759} to that{G1565} man{G444} by{G1223} whom{G3739} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} is betrayed{G3860}{(G5743)}! good{G2570} were it{G2258}{(G5713)} for that{G1565} man{G444} if{G1487} he{G846} had{G1080} never{G3756} been born{G1080}{(G5681)}."
Mark,14,22,"And{G2532} as they{G846} did eat{G2068}{(G5723)}, Jesus{G2424} took{G2983}{(G5631)} bread{G740}, and blessed{G2127}{(G5660)}, and brake{G2806}{(G5656)} it, and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} to them{G846}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Take{G2983}{(G5628)}, eat{G5315}{(G5628)}: this{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} my{G3450} body{G4983}."
Mark,14,23,"And{G2532} he took{G2983}{(G5631)} the cup{G4221}, and when he had given thanks{G2168}{(G5660)}, he gave{G1325}{(G5656)} it to them{G846}: and{G2532} they all{G3956} drank{G4095}{(G5627)} of{G1537} it{G846}."
Mark,14,24,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, This{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} my{G3450} blood{G129} of the new{G2537} testament{G1242}, which{G3588} is shed{G1632}{(G5746)} for{G4012} many{G4183}."
Mark,14,25,"Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, I will{G3364} drink{G4095}{(G5632)} no more{G3754}{G3765} of{G1537} the fruit{G1081} of the vine{G288}, until{G2193} that{G1565} day{G2250} that{G3752} I drink{G4095}{(G5725)} it{G846} new{G2537} in{G1722} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}."
Mark,14,26,"And{G2532} when they had sung an hymn{G5214}{(G5660)}, they went out{G1831}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the mount{G3735} of Olives{G1636}."
Mark,14,27,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846},{G3754} All ye{G3956} shall be offended{G4624}{(G5701)} because of{G1722} me{G1722}{G1698} this{G5026} night{G3571}: for{G3754} it is written{G1125}{(G5769)}, I will smite{G3960}{(G5692)} the shepherd{G4166}, and{G2532} the sheep{G4263} shall be scattered{G1287}{(G5701)}."
Mark,14,28,"But{G235} after{G3326} that I{G3165} am risen{G1453}{(G5683)}, I will go before{G4254}{(G5692)} you{G5209} into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}."
Mark,14,29,"But{G1161} Peter{G4074} said{G5346}{(G5713)} unto him{G846}, Although{G2532}{G1487} all{G3956} shall be offended{G4624}{(G5701)}, yet{G235} will not{G3756} I{G1473}."
Mark,14,30,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, That{G3754} this day{G4594}, even in{G1722} this{G5026} night{G3571}, before{G4250}{G2228} the cock{G220} crow{G5455}{(G5658)} twice{G1364}, thou shalt deny{G533}{(G5695)} me{G3165} thrice{G5151}."
Mark,14,31,"But{G1161} he spake{G3004}{(G5707)} the more{G3123} vehemently{G1537}{G4053}, If{G1437} I{G3165} should{G1163}{(G5753)} die with{G4880}{(G5629)} thee{G4671}, I will not{G3364} deny{G533}{(G5695)} thee{G4571} in any wise{G3364}. Likewise{G5615} also{G1161}{G2532} said they{G3004}{(G5707)} all{G3956}."
Mark,14,32,"And{G2532} they came{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G1519} a place{G5564} which{G3739} was named{G3686} Gethsemane{G1068}: and{G2532} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} to his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Sit ye{G2523}{(G5657)} here{G5602}, while{G2193} I shall pray{G4336}{(G5667)}."
Mark,14,33,"And{G2532} he taketh{G3880}{(G5719)} with{G3326} him{G1438} Peter{G4074} and{G2532} James{G2385} and{G2532} John{G2491}, and{G2532} began{G756}{(G5662)} to be sore amazed{G1568}{(G5745)}, and{G2532} to be very heavy{G85}{(G5721)};"
Mark,14,34,"And{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, My{G3450} soul{G5590} is{G2076}{(G5748)} exceeding sorrowful{G4036} unto{G2193} death{G2288}: tarry ye{G3306}{(G5657)} here{G5602}, and{G2532} watch{G1127}{(G5720)}."
Mark,14,35,"And{G2532} he went forward{G4281}{(G5631)} a little{G3397}, and fell{G4098}{(G5627)} on{G1909} the ground{G1093}, and{G2532} prayed{G4336}{(G5711)} that{G2443}, if{G1487} it were{G2076}{(G5748)} possible{G1415}, the hour{G5610} might pass{G3928}{(G5632)} from{G575} him{G846}."
Mark,14,36,"And{G2532} he said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Abba{G5}, Father{G3962}, all things{G3956} are possible{G1415} unto thee{G4671}; take away{G3911}{(G5628)} this{G5124} cup{G4221} from{G575} me{G1700}: nevertheless{G235} not{G3756} what{G5101} I{G1473} will{G2309}{(G5719)}, but{G235} what{G5101} thou{G4771} wilt."
Mark,14,37,"And{G2532} he cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} findeth{G2147}{(G5719)} them{G846} sleeping{G2518}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto Peter{G4074}, Simon{G4613}, sleepest thou{G2518}{(G5719)}? couldest{G2480}{(G5656)} not{G3756} thou watch{G1127}{(G5658)} one{G3391} hour{G5610}?"
Mark,14,38,"Watch ye{G1127}{(G5720)} and{G2532} pray{G4336}{(G5737)}, lest{G3363} ye enter{G1525}{(G5632)} into{G1519} temptation{G3986}. The spirit{G4151} truly{G3303} is ready{G4289}, but{G1161} the flesh{G4561} is weak{G772}."
Mark,14,39,"And{G2532} again{G3825} he went away{G565}{(G5631)}, and prayed{G4336}{(G5662)}, and spake{G2036}{(G5631)} the same{G846} words{G3056}."
Mark,14,40,"And{G2532} when he returned{G5290}{(G5660)}, he found{G2147}{(G5627)} them{G846} asleep{G2518}{(G5723)} again{G3825},(for{G1063} their{G846} eyes{G3788} were{G2258}{(G5713)} heavy{G916}{(G5772)},) neither{G2532}{G3756} wist they{G1492}{(G5715)} what{G5101} to answer{G611}{(G5680)} him{G846}."
Mark,14,41,"And{G2532} he cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} the third time{G5154}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Sleep on{G2518}{(G5719)} now{G3063}, and{G2532} take your rest{G373}{(G5731)}{(G5732)}: it is enough{G566}{(G5719)}, the hour{G5610} is come{G2064}{(G5627)}; behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, the Son{G5207} of man{G444} is betrayed{G3860}{(G5743)} into{G1519} the hands{G5495} of sinners{G268}."
Mark,14,42,"Rise up{G1453}{(G5728)}, let us go{G71}{(G5725)}; lo{G2400}{(G5628)}, he that betrayeth{G3860}{(G5723)} me{G3165} is at hand{G1448}{(G5758)}."
Mark,14,43,"And{G2532} immediately{G2112}, while he{G846} yet{G2089} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, cometh{G3854}{(G5736)} Judas{G2455}, one{G1520}{G5607}{(G5752)} of the twelve{G1427}, and{G2532} with{G3326} him{G846} a great{G4183} multitude{G3793} with{G3326} swords{G3162} and{G2532} staves{G3586}, from{G3844} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the scribes{G1122} and{G2532} the elders{G4245}."
Mark,14,44,"And{G1161} he that betrayed{G3860}{(G5723)} him{G846} had given{G1325}{(G5715)} them{G846} a token{G4953}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Whomsoever{G3739}{G302} I shall kiss{G5368}{(G5661)}, that same{G846} is he{G2076}{(G5748)}; take{G2902}{(G5657)} him{G846}, and{G2532} lead him away{G520}{(G5628)} safely{G806}."
Mark,14,45,"And{G2532} as soon as he was come{G2064}{(G5631)}, he goeth{G4334}{(G5631)} straightway{G2112} to him{G846}, and saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, Master{G4461}, master{G4461}; and{G2532} kissed{G2705}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Mark,14,46,"And{G1161} they laid{G1911}{(G5627)} their{G846} hands{G5495} on{G1909} him{G846}, and{G2532} took{G2902}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Mark,14,47,"And{G1161} one{G5100} of them{G1520} that stood by{G3936}{(G5761)} drew{G4685}{(G5671)} a sword{G3162}, and smote{G3817}{(G5656)} a servant{G1401} of the high priest{G749}, and{G2532} cut off{G851}{(G5627)} his{G846} ear{G5621}."
Mark,14,48,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Are ye come out{G1831}{(G5627)}, as{G5613} against{G1909} a thief{G3027}, with{G3326} swords{G3162} and{G2532} with staves{G3586} to take{G4815}{(G5629)} me{G3165}?"
Mark,14,49,"I was{G2252}{(G5713)} daily{G2250}{G2596} with{G4314} you{G5209} in{G1722} the temple{G2411} teaching{G1321}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} ye took{G2902}{(G5656)} me{G3165} not{G3756}: but{G235} the scriptures{G1124} must{G2443} be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}."
Mark,14,50,"And{G2532} they all{G3956} forsook{G863}{(G5631)} him{G846}, and fled{G5343}{(G5627)}."
Mark,14,51,"And{G2532} there followed{G190}{(G5707)} him{G846} a{G1520} certain{G5100} young man{G3495}, having a linen cloth{G4616} cast{G4016}{(G5772)} about{G1909} his naked{G1131} body; and{G2532} the young men{G3495} laid hold{G2902}{(G5719)} on him{G846}:"
Mark,14,52,"And{G1161} he left{G2641}{(G5631)} the linen cloth{G4616}, and fled{G5343}{(G5627)} from{G575} them{G846} naked{G1131}."
Mark,14,53,And{G2532} they led{G520} Jesus{G2424} away{G520}{(G5627)} to{G4314} the high priest{G749}: and{G2532} with him{G846} were assembled{G4905}{(G5736)} all{G3956} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the elders{G4245} and{G2532} the scribes{G1122}.
Mark,14,54,"And{G2532} Peter{G4074} followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846} afar{G3113} off{G575}, even{G2193} into{G2080}{G1519} the palace{G833} of the high priest{G749}: and{G2532} he sat{G2258}{(G5713)}{G4775}{(G5740)} with{G3326} the servants{G5257}, and{G2532} warmed himself{G2328}{(G5734)} at{G4314} the fire{G5457}."
Mark,14,55,And{G1161} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} all{G3650} the council{G4892} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} for witness{G3141} against{G2596} Jesus{G2424} to{G1519} put{G2289} him{G846} to death{G2289}{(G5658)}; and{G2532} found{G2147}{(G5707)} none{G3756}.
Mark,14,56,"For{G1063} many{G4183} bare false witness{G5576}{(G5707)} against{G2596} him{G846}, but{G2532} their witness{G3141} agreed{G2258} not{G2470}{G3756} together{G2258}{(G5713)}."
Mark,14,57,"And{G2532} there arose{G450}{(G5631)} certain{G5100}, and bare false witness{G5576}{(G5707)} against{G2596} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Mark,14,58,"{G3754} We{G2249} heard{G191}{(G5656)} him{G846} say{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} I{G1473} will destroy{G2647}{(G5692)} this{G5126} temple{G3485} that is made with hands{G5499}, and{G2532} within{G1223} three{G5140} days{G2250} I will build{G3618}{(G5692)} another{G243} made without hands{G886}."
Mark,14,59,But{G2532} neither{G3761} so{G3779} did{G2470} their{G846} witness{G3141} agree together{G2258}{(G5713)}{G2470}.
Mark,14,60,"And{G2532} the high priest{G749} stood up{G450}{(G5631)} in{G1519} the midst{G3319}, and asked{G1905}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Answerest{G3756} thou{G611}{(G5736)} nothing{G3762}? what{G5101} is it which these{G3778} witness{G2649}{(G5719)} against thee{G4675}?"
Mark,14,61,"But{G1161} he held his peace{G4623}{(G5707)}, and{G2532} answered{G611}{(G5662)} nothing{G3762}. Again{G3825} the high priest{G749} asked{G1905}{(G5707)} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} the Christ{G5547}, the Son{G5207} of the Blessed{G2128}?"
Mark,14,62,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)}: and{G2532} ye shall see{G3700}{(G5695)} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} sitting{G2521}{(G5740)} on{G1537} the right hand{G1188} of power{G1411}, and{G2532} coming{G2064}{(G5740)} in{G3326} the clouds{G3507} of heaven{G3772}."
Mark,14,63,"Then{G1161} the high priest{G749} rent{G1284}{(G5660)} his{G846} clothes{G5509}, and saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, What{G5101} need{G5532} we{G2192}{(G5719)} any further{G2089} witnesses{G3144}?"
Mark,14,64,Ye have heard{G191}{(G5656)} the blasphemy{G988}: what{G5101} think{G5316}{(G5727)} ye{G5213}? And{G1161} they all{G3956} condemned{G2632}{(G5656)} him{G846} to be{G1511}{(G5750)} guilty{G1777} of death{G2288}.
Mark,14,65,"And{G2532} some{G5100} began{G756}{(G5662)} to spit{G1716}{(G5721)} on him{G846}, and{G2532} to cover{G4028}{(G5721)} his{G846} face{G4383}, and{G2532} to buffet{G2852}{(G5721)} him{G846}, and{G2532} to say{G3004}{(G5721)} unto him{G846}, Prophesy{G4395}{(G5657)}: and{G2532} the servants{G5257} did strike{G906}{(G5707)} him{G846} with the palms of their hands{G4475}."
Mark,14,66,"And{G2532} as Peter{G4074} was{G5607}{(G5752)} beneath{G2736} in{G1722} the palace{G833}, there cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} one{G3391} of the maids{G3814} of the high priest{G749}:"
Mark,14,67,"And{G2532} when she saw{G1492}{(G5631)} Peter{G4074} warming himself{G2328}{(G5734)}, she looked{G1689}{(G5660)} upon him{G846}, and said{G3004}{(G5719)}, And{G2532} thou{G4771} also{G2532} wast{G2258}{(G5713)} with{G3326} Jesus{G2424} of Nazareth{G3479}."
Mark,14,68,"But{G1161} he denied{G720}{(G5662)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, I know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756}, neither{G3761} understand I{G1987}{(G5736)} what{G5101} thou{G4771} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)}. And{G2532} he went{G1831}{(G5627)} out{G1854} into{G1519} the porch{G4259}; and{G2532} the cock{G220} crew{G5455}{(G5656)}."
Mark,14,69,"And{G2532} a maid{G3814} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846} again{G3825}, and began{G756}{(G5662)} to say{G3004}{(G5721)} to them that stood by{G3936}{(G5761)}, This{G3754}{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} one of{G1537} them{G846}."
Mark,14,70,"And{G1161} he denied it{G720}{(G5711)} again{G3825}. And{G2532} a little{G3397} after{G3326}, they that stood by{G3936}{(G5761)} said{G3004}{(G5707)} again{G3825} to Peter{G4074}, Surely{G230} thou art{G1488}{(G5748)} one of{G1537} them{G846}: for{G2532}{G1063} thou art{G1488}{(G5748)} a Galilaean{G1057}, and{G2532} thy{G4675} speech{G2981} agreeth{G3662}{(G5719)} thereto."
Mark,14,71,"But{G1161} he began{G756}{(G5662)} to curse{G332}{(G5721)} and{G2532} to swear{G3660}{(G5721)}, saying, I know{G3754}{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} this{G5126} man{G444} of whom{G3739} ye speak{G3004}{(G5719)}."
Mark,14,72,"And{G2532} the{G1537} second time{G1208} the cock{G220} crew{G5455}{(G5656)}. And{G2532} Peter{G4074} called to mind{G363}{(G5681)} the word{G4487} that{G3739} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846},{G3754} Before{G4250} the cock{G220} crow{G5455}{(G5658)} twice{G1364}, thou shalt deny{G533}{(G5695)} me{G3165} thrice{G5151}. And{G2532} when he thought thereon{G1911}{(G5631)}, he wept{G2799}{(G5707)}."
Mark,15,1,"And{G2532} straightway{G2112} in{G1909} the morning{G4404} the chief priests{G749} held{G4160}{(G5660)} a consultation{G4824} with{G3326} the elders{G4245} and{G2532} scribes{G1122} and{G2532} the whole{G3650} council{G4892}, and bound{G1210}{(G5660)} Jesus{G2424}, and carried him away{G667}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} him to Pilate{G4091}."
Mark,15,2,"And{G2532} Pilate{G4091} asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} the King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}? And{G1161} he answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Thou{G4771} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} it."
Mark,15,3,And{G2532} the chief priests{G749} accused{G2723}{(G5707)} him{G846} of many things{G4183}: but{G1161} he{G846} answered{G611}{(G5662)} nothing{G3762}.
Mark,15,4,"And{G1161} Pilate{G4091} asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846} again{G3825}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Answerest thou{G611}{(G5736)} nothing{G3756}{G3762}? behold{G2396} how many things{G4214} they witness{G2649}{(G5719)} against thee{G4675}."
Mark,15,5,But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} yet{G3765} answered{G611}{(G5662)} nothing{G3762}; so{G5620} that Pilate{G4091} marvelled{G2296}{(G5721)}.
Mark,15,6,"Now{G1161} at{G2596} that feast{G1859} he released{G630}{(G5707)} unto them{G846} one{G1520} prisoner{G1198}, whomsoever{G3746} they desired{G154}{(G5710)}."
Mark,15,7,"And{G1161} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} one named{G3004}{(G5746)} Barabbas{G912}, which lay bound{G1210}{(G5772)} with{G3326} them that had made insurrection with him{G4955}, who{G3748} had committed{G4160}{(G5715)} murder{G5408} in{G1722} the insurrection{G4714}."
Mark,15,8,And{G2532} the multitude{G3793} crying aloud{G310}{(G5660)} began{G756}{(G5662)} to desire{G154}{(G5733)} him to do as{G2531} he had ever{G104} done{G4160}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}.
Mark,15,9,"But{G1161} Pilate{G4091} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Will ye{G2309}{(G5719)} that I release{G630}{(G5661)} unto you{G5213} the King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}?"
Mark,15,10,For{G1063} he knew{G1097}{(G5707)} that{G3754} the chief priests{G749} had delivered{G3860}{(G5715)} him{G846} for{G1223} envy{G5355}.
Mark,15,11,"But{G1161} the chief priests{G749} moved{G383}{(G5656)} the people{G3793}, that{G2443} he should rather{G3123} release{G630}{(G5661)} Barabbas{G912} unto them{G846}."
Mark,15,12,"And{G1161} Pilate{G4091} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} again{G3825} unto them{G846}, What{G5101} will ye{G2309}{(G5719)} then{G3767} that I shall do{G4160}{(G5661)} unto him whom{G3739} ye call{G3004}{(G5719)} the King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}?"
Mark,15,13,"And{G1161} they cried out{G2896}{(G5656)} again{G3825}, Crucify{G4717}{(G5657)} him{G846}."
Mark,15,14,"Then{G1161} Pilate{G4091} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}, Why{G1063}, what{G5101} evil{G2556} hath he done{G4160}{(G5656)}? And{G1161} they cried out{G2896}{(G5656)} the more exceedingly{G4056}, Crucify{G4717}{(G5657)} him{G846}."
Mark,15,15,"And{G1161} so Pilate{G4091}, willing{G1014}{(G5740)} to content{G2425}{G4160}{(G5658)} the people{G3793}, released{G630}{(G5656)} Barabbas{G912} unto them{G846}, and{G2532} delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424}, when he had scourged{G5417}{(G5660)} him, to{G2443} be crucified{G4717}{(G5686)}."
Mark,15,16,"And{G1161} the soldiers{G4757} led{G520} him{G846} away{G520}{(G5627)} into{G2080} the hall{G833}, called{G3603} Praetorium{G4232}; and{G2532} they call together{G4779}{(G5719)} the whole{G3650} band{G4686}."
Mark,15,17,"And{G2532} they clothed{G1746}{(G5719)} him{G846} with purple{G4209}, and{G2532} platted{G4120}{(G5660)} a crown{G4735} of thorns{G174}, and put it about{G4060}{(G5719)} his{G846} head,"
Mark,15,18,"And{G2532} began{G756}{(G5662)} to salute{G782}{(G5738)} him{G846}, Hail{G5463}{(G5720)}, King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}!"
Mark,15,19,"And{G2532} they smote{G5180}{(G5707)} him{G846} on the head{G2776} with a reed{G2563}, and{G2532} did spit{G1716}{(G5707)} upon him{G846}, and{G2532} bowing{G5087}{(G5723)} their knees{G1119} worshipped{G4352}{(G5707)} him{G846}."
Mark,15,20,"And{G2532} when{G3753} they had mocked{G1702}{(G5656)} him{G846}, they took off{G1562}{(G5656)} the purple{G4209} from him{G846}, and{G2532} put{G1746} his own{G2398} clothes{G2440} on{G1746}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} led{G1806} him{G846} out{G1806}{(G5719)} to{G2443} crucify{G4717}{(G5661)} him{G846}."
Mark,15,21,"And{G2532} they compel{G29}{(G5719)} one{G5100} Simon{G4613} a Cyrenian{G2956}, who passed by{G3855}{(G5723)}, coming{G2064}{(G5740)} out of{G575} the country{G68}, the father{G3962} of Alexander{G223} and{G2532} Rufus{G4504}, to{G2443} bear{G142}{(G5661)} his{G846} cross{G4716}."
Mark,15,22,"And{G2532} they bring{G5342}{(G5719)} him{G846} unto{G1909} the place{G5117} Golgotha{G1115}, which{G3739} is{G2076}{(G5748)}, being interpreted{G3177}{(G5746)}, The place{G5117} of a skull{G2898}."
Mark,15,23,And{G2532} they gave{G1325}{(G5707)} him{G846} to drink{G4095}{(G5629)} wine{G3631} mingled with myrrh{G4669}{(G5772)}: but{G1161} he received{G2983}{(G5627)} it not{G3756}.
Mark,15,24,"And{G2532} when they had crucified{G4717}{(G5660)} him{G846}, they parted{G1266}{(G5707)} his{G846} garments{G2440}, casting{G906}{(G5723)} lots{G2819} upon{G1909} them{G846}, what{G5101} every man{G5101} should take{G142}{(G5661)}."
Mark,15,25,"And{G1161} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} the third{G5154} hour{G5610}, and{G2532} they crucified{G4717}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Mark,15,26,"And{G2532} the superscription{G1923} of his{G846} accusation{G156} was{G2258}{(G5713)} written over{G1924}{(G5772)}, THE KING{G935} OF THE JEWS{G2453}."
Mark,15,27,"And{G2532} with{G4862} him{G846} they crucify{G4717}{(G5719)} two{G1417} thieves{G3027}; the one{G1520} on{G1537} his right hand{G1188}, and{G2532} the other{G1520} on{G1537} his{G846} left{G2176}."
Mark,15,28,"And{G2532} the scripture{G1124} was fulfilled{G4137}{(G5681)}, which{G3588} saith{G3004}{(G5723)}, And{G2532} he was numbered{G3049}{(G5681)} with{G3326} the transgressors{G459}."
Mark,15,29,"And{G2532} they that passed by{G3899}{(G5740)} railed{G987}{(G5707)} on him{G846}, wagging{G2795}{(G5723)} their{G846} heads{G2776}, and{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Ah{G3758}, thou that destroyest{G2647}{(G5723)} the temple{G3485}, and{G2532} buildest{G3618}{(G5723)} it in{G1722} three{G5140} days{G2250},"
Mark,15,30,"Save{G4982}{(G5657)} thyself{G4572}, and{G2532} come down{G2597}{(G5628)} from{G575} the cross{G4716}."
Mark,15,31,"Likewise{G1161}{G3668} also{G2532} the chief priests{G749} mocking{G1702}{(G5723)} said{G3004}{(G5707)} among{G4314} themselves{G240} with{G3326} the scribes{G1122}, He saved{G4982}{(G5656)} others{G243}; himself{G1438} he cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} save{G4982}{(G5658)}."
Mark,15,32,"Let{G2597} Christ{G5547} the King{G935} of Israel{G2474} descend{G2597}{(G5628)} now{G3568} from{G575} the cross{G4716}, that{G2443} we may see{G1492}{(G5632)} and{G2532} believe{G4100}{(G5661)}.

Luke,1,48,"For{G3754} he hath regarded{G1914}{(G5656)}{G1909} the low estate{G5014} of his{G846} handmaiden{G1399}: for{G1063}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, from{G575} henceforth{G3568} all{G3956} generations{G1074} shall call{G3106} me{G3165} blessed{G3106}{(G5692)}."
Luke,1,49,For{G3754} he that is mighty{G1415} hath done{G4160}{(G5656)} to me{G3427} great things{G3167}; and{G2532} holy{G40} is his{G846} name{G3686}.
Luke,1,50,And{G2532} his{G846} mercy{G1656} is on them that fear{G5399}{(G5740)} him{G846} from{G1519} generation{G1074} to generation{G1074}.
Luke,1,51,He hath shewed{G4160}{(G5656)} strength{G2904} with{G1722} his{G846} arm{G1023}; he hath scattered{G1287}{(G5656)} the proud{G5244} in the imagination{G1271} of their{G846} hearts{G2588}.
Luke,1,52,"He hath put down{G2507}{(G5627)} the mighty{G1413} from{G575} their seats{G2362}, and{G2532} exalted{G5312}{(G5656)} them of low degree{G5011}."
Luke,1,53,He hath filled{G1705}{(G5656)} the hungry{G3983}{(G5723)} with good things{G18}; and{G2532} the rich{G4147}{(G5723)} he hath sent{G1821} empty{G2756} away{G1821}{(G5656)}.
Luke,1,54,"He hath holpen{G482}{(G5633)} his{G846} servant{G3816} Israel{G2474}, in remembrance{G3415}{(G5683)} of his mercy{G1656};"
Luke,1,55,"As{G2531} he spake{G2980}{(G5656)} to{G4314} our{G2257} fathers{G3962}, to Abraham{G11}, and{G2532} to his{G846} seed{G4690} for{G1519} ever{G165}."

Luke,4,14,And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} returned{G5290}{(G5656)} in{G1722} the power{G1411} of the Spirit{G4151} into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}: and{G2532} there went out{G1831}{(G5627)} a fame{G5345} of{G4012} him{G846} through{G2596} all{G3650} the region round about{G4066}.
Luke,4,15,"And{G2532} he{G846} taught{G1321}{(G5707)} in{G1722} their{G846} synagogues{G4864}, being glorified{G1392}{(G5746)} of{G5259} all{G3956}."
Luke,4,16,"And{G2532} he came{G2064}{(G5627)} to{G1519} Nazareth{G3478}, where{G3757} he had been{G2258}{(G5713)} brought up{G5142}{(G5772)}: and{G2532}, as{G2596} his{G846} custom{G1486}{(G5756)} was{G2596}, he went{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the synagogue{G4864} on{G1722} the sabbath{G4521} day{G2250}, and{G2532} stood up{G450}{(G5627)} for to read{G314}{(G5629)}."
Luke,4,17,"And{G2532} there was delivered{G1929}{(G5681)} unto him{G846} the book{G975} of the prophet{G4396} Esaias{G2268}. And{G2532} when he had opened{G380}{(G5660)} the book{G975}, he found{G2147}{(G5627)} the place{G5117} where{G3757} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} written{G1125}{(G5772)},"
Luke,4,18,"The Spirit{G4151} of the Lord{G2962} is upon{G1909} me{G1691}, because{G1752} he hath anointed{G5548}{(G5656)} me{G3165} to preach the gospel{G2097}{(G5733)} to the poor{G4434}; he hath sent{G649}{(G5758)} me{G3165} to heal{G2390}{(G5664)} the brokenhearted{G4937}{(G5772)}{G2588}, to preach{G2784}{(G5658)} deliverance{G859} to the captives{G164}, and{G2532} recovering of sight{G309} to the blind{G5185}, to set{G649}{(G5658)} at{G1722} liberty{G859} them that are bruised{G2352}{(G5772)},"
Luke,4,19,To preach{G2784}{(G5658)} the acceptable{G1184} year{G1763} of the Lord{G2962}.
Luke,4,20,"And{G2532} he closed{G4428}{(G5660)} the book{G975}, and he gave it again{G591}{(G5631)} to the minister{G5257}, and sat down{G2523}{(G5656)}. And{G2532} the eyes{G3788} of all them{G3956} that were{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} the synagogue{G4864} were fastened{G816}{(G5723)} on him{G846}."
Luke,4,21,"And{G1161} he began{G756}{(G5662)} to say{G3004}{(G5721)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, This{G3754} day{G4594} is{G4137} this{G3778} scripture{G1124} fulfilled{G4137}{(G5769)} in{G1722} your{G5216} ears{G3775}."
Luke,4,22,"And{G2532} all{G3956} bare{G3140} him{G846} witness{G3140}{(G5707)}, and{G2532} wondered{G2296}{(G5707)} at{G1909} the gracious{G5485} words{G3056} which{G3588} proceeded{G1607}{(G5740)} out of{G1537} his{G846} mouth{G4750}. And{G2532} they said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} this{G3778} Joseph's{G2501} son{G5207}?"
Luke,4,23,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, Ye will{G2046} surely{G3843} say{G2046}{(G5692)} unto me{G3427} this{G5026} proverb{G3850}, Physician{G2395}, heal{G2323}{(G5657)} thyself{G4572}: whatsoever{G3745} we have heard{G191}{(G5656)} done{G1096}{(G5637)} in{G1722} Capernaum{G2584}, do{G4160}{(G5657)} also{G2532} here{G5602} in{G1722} thy{G4675} country{G3968}."
Luke,4,24,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} No{G3762} prophet{G4396} is{G2076}{(G5748)} accepted{G1184} in{G1722} his own{G846} country{G3968}."
Luke,4,25,"But{G1161} I tell{G3004}{(G5719)} you{G5213} of{G1909} a truth{G225}, many{G4183} widows{G5503} were{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} Israel{G2474} in{G1722} the days{G2250} of Elias{G2243}, when{G3753} the heaven{G3772} was shut up{G2808}{(G5681)}{G1909} three{G5140} years{G2094} and{G2532} six{G1803} months{G3376}, when{G5613} great{G3173} famine{G3042} was{G1096}{(G5633)} throughout{G1909} all{G3956} the land{G1093};"
Luke,4,26,"But{G2532} unto{G4314} none{G3762} of them{G846} was{G3992} Elias{G2243} sent{G3992}{(G5681)}, save{G1508} unto{G1519} Sarepta{G4558}, a city of Sidon{G4605}, unto{G4314} a woman{G1135} that was a widow{G5503}."
Luke,4,27,"And{G2532} many{G4183} lepers{G3015} were{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} Israel{G2474} in the time{G1909} of Eliseus{G1666} the prophet{G4396}; and{G2532} none{G3762} of them{G846} was cleansed{G2511}{(G5681)}, saving{G1508} Naaman{G3497} the Syrian{G4948}."
Luke,4,28,"And{G2532} all they{G3956} in{G1722} the synagogue{G4864}, when they heard{G191}{(G5723)} these things{G5023}, were filled{G4130}{(G5681)} with wrath{G2372},"
Luke,4,29,"And{G2532} rose up{G450}{(G5631)}, and thrust{G1544}{(G5627)} him{G846} out of{G1854} the city{G4172}, and{G2532} led{G71}{(G5627)} him{G846} unto{G2193} the brow{G3790} of the hill{G3735} whereon{G1909}{G3739} their{G846} city{G4172} was built{G3618}{(G5718)}, that{G1519} they might cast{G2630} him{G846} down headlong{G2630}{(G5658)}."
Luke,4,30,"But{G1161} he{G846} passing{G1330}{(G5631)} through{G1223} the midst{G3319} of them{G846} went his way{G4198}{(G5711)},"
Luke,4,31,"And{G2532} came down{G2718}{(G5627)} to{G1519} Capernaum{G2584}, a city{G4172} of Galilee{G1056}, and{G2532} taught{G1321}{(G5723)} them{G846}{G2258}{(G5713)} on{G1722} the sabbath days{G4521}."
Luke,4,32,And{G2532} they were astonished{G1605}{(G5712)} at{G1909} his{G846} doctrine{G1322}: for{G3754} his{G846} word{G3056} was{G2258}{(G5713)} with{G1722} power{G1849}.
Luke,4,33,"And{G2532} in{G1722} the synagogue{G4864} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a man{G444}, which had{G2192}{(G5723)} a spirit{G4151} of an unclean{G169} devil{G1140}, and{G2532} cried out{G349}{(G5656)} with a loud{G3173} voice{G5456},"
Luke,4,34,"Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Let us alone{G1436}; what{G5101} have we to do{G2254} with thee{G4671},{G2532} thou Jesus{G2424} of Nazareth{G3479}? art thou come{G2064}{(G5627)} to destroy{G622}{(G5658)} us{G2248}? I know{G1492}{(G5758)} thee{G4571} who{G5101} thou art{G1488}{(G5748)}; the Holy One{G40} of God{G2316}."
Luke,4,35,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Hold thy peace{G5392}{(G5682)}, and{G2532} come{G1831}{(G5628)} out of{G1537} him{G846}. And{G2532} when the devil{G1140} had thrown{G4496}{(G5660)} him{G846} in{G1519} the midst{G3319}, he came{G1831}{(G5627)} out of{G575} him{G846}, and hurt{G984}{(G5660)} him{G846} not{G3367}."
Luke,4,36,"And{G2532} they were{G1096}{(G5633)} all{G1909}{G3956} amazed{G2285}, and{G2532} spake{G4814}{(G5707)} among{G4314} themselves{G240}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, What{G5101} a word{G3056} is this{G3778}! for{G3754} with{G1722} authority{G1849} and{G2532} power{G1411} he commandeth{G2004}{(G5719)} the unclean{G169} spirits{G4151}, and{G2532} they come out{G1831}{(G5736)}."
Luke,4,37,And{G2532} the fame{G2279} of{G4012} him{G846} went out{G1607}{(G5711)} into{G1519} every{G3956} place{G5117} of the country round about{G4066}.
Luke,4,38,"And{G1161} he arose{G450}{(G5631)} out of{G1537} the synagogue{G4864}, and entered{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} Simon's{G4613} house{G3614}. And{G1161} Simon's{G4613} wife's mother{G3994} was{G2258}{(G5713)} taken with{G4912}{(G5746)} a great{G3173} fever{G4446}; and{G2532} they besought{G2065}{(G5656)} him{G846} for{G4012} her{G846}."
Luke,4,39,"And{G2532} he stood{G2186}{(G5631)} over{G1883} her{G846}, and rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} the fever{G4446}; and{G2532} it left{G863}{(G5656)} her{G846}: and immediately{G3916} she arose{G450}{(G5631)} and{G1161} ministered{G1247}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}."
Luke,4,40,"Now{G1161} when the sun{G2246} was setting{G1416}{(G5723)}, all{G3956} they that{G3745} had{G2192}{(G5707)} any sick{G770}{(G5723)} with divers{G4164} diseases{G3554} brought{G71}{(G5627)} them{G846} unto{G4314} him{G846}; and{G1161} he laid{G2007} his hands{G5495} on{G2007}{(G5631)} every{G1538} one{G1520} of them{G846}, and healed{G2323}{(G5656)} them{G846}."
Luke,4,41,"And{G1161} devils{G1140} also{G2532} came{G1831}{(G5711)} out of{G575} many{G4183}, crying out{G2896}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} Thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} Christ{G5547} the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}. And{G2532} he rebuking{G2008}{(G5723)} them suffered{G1439}{(G5707)} them{G846} not{G3756} to speak{G2980}{(G5721)}: for{G3754} they knew{G1492}{(G5715)} that he{G846} was{G1511}{(G5750)} Christ{G5547}."
Luke,4,42,"And{G1161} when it was{G1096}{(G5637)} day{G2250}, he departed{G1831}{(G5631)} and went{G4198}{(G5675)} into{G1519} a desert{G2048} place{G5117}: and{G2532} the people{G3793} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} him{G846}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G2193} him{G846}, and{G2532} stayed{G2722}{(G5707)} him{G846}, that he should not{G3361} depart{G4198}{(G5738)} from{G575} them{G846}."
Luke,4,43,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846},{G3754} I{G3165} must{G1163}{(G5748)} preach{G2097}{(G5670)} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316} to other{G2087} cities{G4172} also{G2532}: for{G3754} therefore{G1519}{G5124} am I sent{G649}{(G5769)}."
Luke,4,44,And{G2532} he preached{G2258}{(G5713)}{G2784}{(G5723)} in{G1722} the synagogues{G4864} of Galilee{G1056}.
Luke,5,1,"And{G1161} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, that, as{G1722} the people{G3793} pressed upon{G1945}{(G5738)} him{G846} to hear{G191}{(G5721)} the word{G3056} of God{G2316},{G2532} he{G846} stood{G2258}{(G5713)}{G2476}{(G5761)} by{G3844} the lake{G3041} of Gennesaret{G1082},"
Luke,5,2,"And{G2532} saw{G1492}{(G5627)} two{G1417} ships{G4143} standing{G2476}{(G5761)} by{G3844} the lake{G3041}: but{G1161} the fishermen{G231} were gone{G576}{(G5631)} out of{G575} them{G846}, and were washing{G637}{(G5656)} their nets{G1350}."
Luke,5,3,"And{G1161} he entered{G1684}{(G5631)} into{G1519} one{G1520} of the ships{G4143}, which{G3739} was{G2258}{(G5713)} Simon's{G4613}, and prayed{G2065}{(G5656)} him{G846} that he would thrust out{G1877}{(G5629)} a little{G3641} from{G575} the land{G1093}. And{G2532} he sat down{G2523}{(G5660)}, and taught{G1321}{(G5707)} the people{G3793} out of{G1537} the ship{G4143}."
Luke,5,4,"Now{G1161} when{G5613} he had left{G3973}{(G5668)} speaking{G2980}{(G5723)}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} Simon{G4613}, Launch out{G1877}{(G5628)} into{G1519} the deep{G899}, and{G2532} let down{G5465}{(G5657)} your{G5216} nets{G1350} for{G1519} a draught{G61}."
Luke,5,5,"And{G2532} Simon{G4613} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Master{G1988}, we have toiled{G2872}{(G5660)} all{G3650}{G1223} the night{G3571}, and have taken{G2983}{(G5627)} nothing{G3762}: nevertheless{G1161} at{G1909} thy{G4675} word{G4487} I will let down{G5465}{(G5692)} the net{G1350}."
Luke,5,6,"And{G2532} when they had{G4160} this{G5124} done{G4160}{(G5660)}, they inclosed{G4788}{(G5656)} a great{G4183} multitude{G4128} of fishes{G2486}: and{G1161} their{G846} net{G1350} brake{G1284}{(G5712)}."
Luke,5,7,"And{G2532} they beckoned{G2656}{(G5656)} unto their partners{G3353}, which{G3588} were in{G1722} the other{G2087} ship{G4143}, that they should come{G2064}{(G5631)} and help{G4815}{(G5641)} them{G846}. And{G2532} they came{G2064}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} filled{G4130}{(G5656)} both{G297} the ships{G4143}, so{G5620} that they{G846} began to sink{G1036}{(G5745)}."
Luke,5,8,"When{G1161} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} it, he fell down at{G4363}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424}' knees{G1119}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Depart{G1831}{(G5628)} from{G575} me{G1700}; for{G3754} I am{G1510}{(G5748)} a sinful{G268} man{G435}, O Lord{G2962}."
Luke,5,9,"For{G1063} he{G846} was astonished{G4023}{(G5627)}{G2285}, and{G2532} all{G3956} that were{G4862} with him{G846}, at{G1909} the draught{G61} of the fishes{G2486} which{G3739} they had taken{G4815}{(G5627)}:"
Luke,5,10,"And{G1161} so{G3668} was also{G2532} James{G2385}, and{G2532} John{G2491}, the sons{G5207} of Zebedee{G2199}, which{G3739} were{G2258}{(G5713)} partners{G2844} with Simon{G4613}.

Luke,5,12,"And{G2532} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, when he{G846} was{G1511}{(G5750)}{G1722} in{G1722} a certain{G3391} city{G4172},{G2532} behold{G2400}{(G5628)} a man{G435} full{G4134} of leprosy{G3014}: who{G2532} seeing{G1492}{(G5631)} Jesus{G2424} fell{G4098}{(G5631)} on{G1909} his face{G4383}, and besought{G1189}{(G5681)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Lord{G2962}, if{G1437} thou wilt{G2309}{(G5725)}, thou canst{G1410}{(G5736)} make{G2511} me{G3165} clean{G2511}{(G5658)}."
Luke,5,13,"And{G2532} he put forth{G1614}{(G5660)} his hand{G5495}, and touched{G680}{(G5662)} him{G846}, saying{G2036}{(G5631)}, I will{G2309}{(G5719)}: be thou clean{G2511}{(G5682)}. And{G2532} immediately{G2112} the leprosy{G3014} departed{G565}{(G5627)} from{G575} him{G846}."
Luke,5,14,"And{G2532} he{G846} charged{G3853}{(G5656)} him{G846} to tell{G2036}{(G5629)} no man{G3367}: but{G235} go{G565}{(G5631)}, and shew{G1166}{(G5657)} thyself{G4572} to the priest{G2409}, and{G2532} offer{G4374}{(G5628)} for{G4012} thy{G4675} cleansing{G2512}, according as{G2531} Moses{G3475} commanded{G4367}{(G5656)}, for{G1519} a testimony{G3142} unto them{G846}."
Luke,5,15,"But{G1161} so much the more{G3123} went there{G1330} a fame{G3056} abroad{G1330}{(G5711)} of{G4012} him{G846}: and{G2532} great{G4183} multitudes{G3793} came together{G4905}{(G5711)} to hear{G191}{(G5721)}, and{G2532} to be healed{G2323}{(G5745)} by{G5259} him{G846} of{G575} their{G846} infirmities{G769}."
Luke,5,16,"And{G1161} he withdrew{G2258}{(G5713)}{G5298}{(G5723)} himself{G846} into{G1722} the wilderness{G2048}, and{G2532} prayed{G4336}{(G5740)}."
Luke,5,17,"And{G2532} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)} on{G1722} a certain{G3391} day{G2250}, as{G2532} he{G846} was{G2258}{(G5713)} teaching{G1321}{(G5723)}, that{G2532} there were{G2258}{(G5713)} Pharisees{G5330} and{G2532} doctors of the law{G3547} sitting by{G2521}{(G5740)}, which{G3739} were{G2258}{(G5713)} come{G2064}{(G5756)} out of{G1537} every{G3956} town{G2968} of Galilee{G1056}, and{G2532} Judaea{G2449}, and{G2532} Jerusalem{G2419}: and{G2532} the power{G1411} of the Lord{G2962} was{G2258}{(G5713)} present to{G1519} heal{G2390}{(G5738)} them{G846}."
Luke,5,18,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, men{G435} brought{G5342}{(G5723)} in{G1909} a bed{G2825} a man{G444} which{G3739} was{G2258}{(G5713)} taken with a palsy{G3886}{(G5772)}: and{G2532} they sought{G2212}{(G5707)} means to bring{G1533} him{G846} in{G1533}{(G5629)}, and{G2532} to lay{G5087}{(G5629)} him before{G1799} him{G846}."
Luke,5,19,"And{G2532} when they could{G2147} not{G3361} find{G2147}{(G5631)} by{G1223} what{G4169} way they might bring{G1533} him{G846} in{G1533}{(G5632)} because{G1223} of the multitude{G3793}, they went{G305}{(G5631)} upon{G1909} the housetop{G1430}, and let{G2524} him{G846} down{G2524}{(G5656)} through{G1223} the tiling{G2766} with{G4862} his couch{G2826} into{G1519} the midst{G3319} before{G1715} Jesus{G2424}."
Luke,5,20,"And{G2532} when he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} their{G846} faith{G4102}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Man{G444}, thy{G4675} sins{G266} are forgiven{G863}{(G5769)} thee{G4671}."
Luke,5,21,"And{G2532} the scribes{G1122} and{G2532} the Pharisees{G5330} began{G756}{(G5662)} to reason{G1260}{(G5738)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Who{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778} which{G3739} speaketh{G2980}{(G5719)} blasphemies{G988}? Who{G5101} can{G1410}{(G5736)} forgive{G863}{(G5721)} sins{G266}, but{G1508} God{G2316} alone{G3441}?"
Luke,5,22,"But{G1161} when Jesus{G2424} perceived{G1921}{(G5631)} their{G846} thoughts{G1261}, he answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, What{G5101} reason ye{G1260}{(G5736)} in{G1722} your{G5216} hearts{G2588}?"
Luke,5,23,"Whether{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} easier{G2123}, to say{G2036}{(G5629)}, Thy{G4675} sins{G266} be forgiven{G863}{(G5769)} thee{G4671}; or{G2228} to say{G2036}{(G5629)}, Rise up{G1453}{(G5669)} and{G2532} walk{G4043}{(G5720)}?"
Luke,5,24,"But{G1161} that{G2443} ye may know{G1492}{(G5762)} that{G3754} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} power{G1849} upon{G1909} earth{G1093} to forgive{G863}{(G5721)} sins{G266},(he{G266} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto the sick of the palsy{G3886}{(G5772)},) I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, Arise{G1453}{(G5669)}, and{G2532} take up{G142}{(G5660)} thy{G4675} couch{G2826}, and go{G4198}{(G5737)} into{G1519} thine{G4675} house{G3624}."
Luke,5,25,"And{G2532} immediately{G3916} he rose up{G450}{(G5631)} before{G1799} them{G846}, and took up{G142}{(G5660)} that whereon{G1909}{G3739} he lay{G2621}{(G5711)}, and departed{G565}{(G5627)} to{G1519} his own{G846} house{G3624}, glorifying{G1392}{(G5723)} God{G2316}."
Luke,5,26,"And{G2532} they were{G2983}{(G5627)} all{G537} amazed{G1611}, and{G2532} they glorified{G1392}{(G5707)} God{G2316}, and{G2532} were filled{G4130}{(G5681)} with fear{G5401}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} We have seen{G1492}{(G5627)} strange things{G3861} to day{G4594}."
Luke,5,27,"And{G2532} after{G3326} these things{G5023} he went forth{G1831}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} saw{G2300}{(G5662)} a publican{G5057}, named{G3686} Levi{G3018}, sitting{G2521}{(G5740)} at{G1909} the receipt of custom{G5058}: and{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Follow{G190}{(G5720)} me{G3427}."
Luke,5,28,"And{G2532} he left{G2641}{(G5631)} all{G537}, rose up{G450}{(G5631)}, and followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Luke,5,29,And{G2532} Levi{G3018} made{G4160}{(G5656)} him{G846} a great{G3173} feast{G1403} in{G1722} his own{G846} house{G3614}: and{G2532} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a great{G4183} company{G3793} of publicans{G5057} and{G2532} of others{G243} that{G3739} sat down{G2258}{(G5713)}{G2621}{(G5740)} with{G3326} them{G846}.
Luke,5,30,"But{G2532} their{G846} scribes{G1122} and{G2532} Pharisees{G5330} murmured{G1111}{(G5707)} against{G4314} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Why{G1302} do ye eat{G2068}{(G5719)} and{G2532} drink{G4095}{(G5719)} with{G3326} publicans{G5057} and{G2532} sinners{G268}?"
Luke,5,31,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, They that are whole{G5198}{(G5723)} need{G5532}{G2192}{(G5719)} not{G3756} a physician{G2395}; but{G235} they that are{G2192}{(G5723)} sick{G2560}."
Luke,5,32,"I came{G2064}{(G5754)} not{G3756} to call{G2564}{(G5658)} the righteous{G1342}, but{G235} sinners{G268} to{G1519} repentance{G3341}."
Luke,5,33,"And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Why{G1302} do{G3522} the disciples{G3101} of John{G2491} fast{G3522}{(G5719)} often{G4437}, and{G2532} make{G4160}{(G5731)} prayers{G1162}, and{G2532} likewise{G3668} the disciples{G3588} of the Pharisees{G5330}; but{G1161} thine{G4674} eat{G2068}{(G5719)} and{G2532} drink{G4095}{(G5719)}?"
Luke,5,34,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846},{G3361} Can ye{G1410}{(G5736)} make{G4160}{(G5658)} the children{G5207} of the bridechamber{G3567} fast{G3522}{(G5721)}, while{G3739}{G1722} the bridegroom{G3566} is{G2076}{(G5748)} with{G3326} them{G846}?"
Luke,5,35,"But{G1161} the days{G2250} will come{G2064}{(G5695)}, when{G3752}{G2532} the bridegroom{G3566} shall be taken away{G522}{(G5686)} from{G575} them{G846}, and then{G5119} shall they fast{G3522}{(G5692)} in{G1722} those{G1565} days{G2250}."
Luke,5,36,"And{G1161} he spake{G3004}{(G5707)} also{G2532} a parable{G3850} unto{G4314} them{G846};{G3754} No man{G3762} putteth{G1911}{(G5719)} a piece{G1915} of a new{G2537} garment{G2440} upon{G1909} an old{G2440}{G3820}; if otherwise, then{G1490} both{G2532} the new{G2537} maketh a rent{G4977}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} the piece{G1915} that was taken out of{G575} the new{G2537} agreeth{G4856}{(G5719)} not{G3756} with the old{G3820}."
Luke,5,37,"And{G2532} no man{G3762} putteth{G906}{(G5719)} new{G3501} wine{G3631} into{G1519} old{G3820} bottles{G779}; else{G1490} the new{G3501} wine{G3631} will burst{G4486}{(G5692)} the bottles{G779}, and{G2532}{G846} be spilled{G1632}{(G5701)}, and{G2532} the bottles{G779} shall perish{G622}{(G5698)}."
Luke,5,38,But{G235} new{G3501} wine{G3631} must be put{G992} into{G1519} new{G2537} bottles{G779}; and{G2532} both{G297} are preserved{G4933}{(G5743)}.
Luke,5,39,"No man{G3762} also{G2532} having drunk{G4095}{(G5631)} old{G3820} wine straightway{G2112} desireth{G2309}{(G5719)} new{G3501}: for{G1063} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, The old{G3820} is{G2076}{(G5748)} better{G5543}."
Luke,6,1,"And{G1161} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)} on{G1722} the second{G1207} sabbath{G4521} after the first{G1207}, that he{G846} went{G1279}{(G5738)} through{G1223} the corn fields{G4702}; and{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101} plucked{G5089}{(G5707)} the ears of corn{G4719}, and{G2532} did eat{G2068}{(G5707)}, rubbing{G5597}{(G5723)} them in their hands{G5495}."
Luke,6,2,"And{G1161} certain{G5100} of the Pharisees{G5330} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} do ye{G4160}{(G5719)} that which{G3739} is{G1832} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} to do{G4160}{(G5721)} on{G1722} the sabbath days{G4521}?"
Luke,6,3,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} answering{G611}{(G5679)} them{G4314}{G846} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Have ye{G314} not{G3761} read{G314}{(G5627)} so much as{G3761} this{G5124}, what{G3739} David{G1138} did{G4160}{(G5656)}, when{G3698} himself{G846} was an hungred{G3983}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} they which{G3588} were{G5607}{(G5752)} with{G3326} him{G846};"
Luke,6,4,"How{G5613} he went{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the house{G3624} of God{G2316}, and{G2532} did take{G2983}{(G5627)} and{G2532} eat{G5315}{(G5627)} the shewbread{G740}{G4286}, and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} also{G2532} to them that were with{G3326} him{G846}; which{G3739} it is{G1832} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)} but for{G1508} the priests{G2409} alone{G3441}?"
Luke,6,5,"And{G2532} he said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}, That{G3754} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} is{G2076}{(G5748)} Lord{G2962} also{G2532} of the sabbath{G4521}."
Luke,6,6,"And{G1161} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)} also{G2532} on{G1722} another{G2087} sabbath{G4521}, that he{G846} entered{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} the synagogue{G4864} and{G2532} taught{G1321}{(G5721)}: and{G2532} there{G1563} was{G2258}{(G5713)} a man{G444} whose{G2532}{G846} right{G1188} hand{G5495} was{G2258}{(G5713)} withered{G3584}."
Luke,6,7,"And{G1161} the scribes{G1122} and{G2532} Pharisees{G5330} watched{G3906}{(G5707)} him{G846}, whether{G1487} he would heal{G2323}{(G5692)} on{G1722} the sabbath day{G4521}; that{G2443} they might find{G2147}{(G5632)} an accusation{G2724} against him{G846}."
Luke,6,8,"But{G1161} he{G846} knew{G1492}{(G5715)} their{G846} thoughts{G1261}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} to the man{G444} which{G3588} had{G2192}{(G5723)} the withered{G3584} hand{G5495}, Rise up{G1453}{(G5669)}, and{G2532} stand forth{G2476}{(G5628)} in{G1519} the midst{G3319}. And{G1161} he arose{G450}{(G5631)} and stood forth{G2476}{(G5627)}."
Luke,6,9,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto{G4314} them{G846}, I will ask{G1905}{(G5692)} you{G5209} one thing{G5101}; Is it lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} on the sabbath days{G4521} to do good{G15}{(G5658)}, or{G2228} to do evil{G2554}{(G5658)}? to save{G4982}{(G5658)} life{G5590}, or{G2228} to destroy{G622}{(G5658)} it?"
Luke,6,10,"And{G2532} looking round about upon{G4017}{(G5671)} them{G846} all{G3956}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto the man{G444}, Stretch forth{G1614}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} hand{G5495}. And{G1161} he did{G4160}{(G5656)} so{G3779}: and{G2532} his{G846} hand{G5495} was restored{G600}{(G5681)} whole{G5199} as{G5613} the other{G243}."
Luke,6,11,And{G1161} they{G846} were filled{G4130}{(G5681)} with madness{G454}; and{G2532} communed{G1255}{(G5707)} one with another{G4314}{G240} what{G5101}{G302} they might do{G4160}{(G5659)} to Jesus{G2424}.
Luke,6,12,"And{G1161} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)} in{G1722} those{G5025} days{G2250}, that he went out{G1831}{(G5627)} into{G1519} a mountain{G3735} to pray{G4336}{(G5664)}, and{G2532} continued all night{G1273}{(G5723)}{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} prayer{G4335} to God{G2316}."
Luke,6,13,"And{G2532} when{G3753} it was{G1096}{(G5633)} day{G2250}, he called{G4377}{(G5656)} unto him his{G846} disciples{G3101}: and{G2532} of{G575} them{G846} he chose{G1586}{(G5671)} twelve{G1427}, whom{G3739} also{G2532} he named{G3687}{(G5656)} apostles{G652};"

Luke,7,14,"And{G2532} he came{G4334}{(G5631)} and touched{G680}{(G5662)} the bier{G4673}: and{G1161} they that bare{G941}{(G5723)} him stood still{G2476}{(G5627)}. And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Young man{G3495}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, Arise{G1453}{(G5682)}."
Luke,7,15,"And{G2532} he that was dead{G3498} sat up{G339}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} began{G756}{(G5662)} to speak{G2980}{(G5721)}. And{G2532} he delivered{G1325}{(G5656)} him{G846} to his{G846} mother{G3384}."
Luke,7,16,"And{G1161} there came{G2983}{(G5627)} a fear{G5401} on all{G537}: and{G2532} they glorified{G1392}{(G5707)} God{G2316}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, That{G3754} a great{G3173} prophet{G4396} is risen up{G1453}{(G5769)} among{G1722} us{G2254}; and{G2532}, That{G3754} God{G2316} hath visited{G1980}{(G5662)} his{G846} people{G2992}."
Luke,7,17,"And{G2532} this{G3778} rumour{G3056} of{G4012} him{G846} went forth{G1831}{(G5627)} throughout{G1722} all{G3650} Judaea{G2449}, and{G2532} throughout{G1722} all{G3956} the region round about{G4066}."
Luke,7,18,And{G2532} the disciples{G3101} of John{G2491} shewed{G518}{(G5656)} him{G846} of{G4012} all{G3956} these things{G5130}.
Luke,7,19,"And{G2532} John{G2491} calling{G4341}{(G5666)} unto him two{G1417}{G5100} of his{G846} disciples{G3101} sent{G3992}{(G5656)} them to{G4314} Jesus{G2424}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} he that should come{G2064}{(G5740)}? or{G2228} look we for{G4328}{(G5725)} another{G243}?"
Luke,7,20,"When{G1161} the men{G435} were come{G3854}{(G5637)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, John{G2491} Baptist{G910} hath sent{G649}{(G5758)} us{G2248} unto{G4314} thee{G4571}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} he that should come{G2064}{(G5740)}? or{G2228} look we for{G4328}{(G5719)}{(G5725)} another{G243}?"
Luke,7,21,"And{G1161} in{G1722} that same{G846} hour{G5610} he cured{G2323}{(G5656)} many{G4183} of{G575} their infirmities{G3554} and{G2532} plagues{G3148}, and{G2532} of evil{G4190} spirits{G4151}; and{G2532} unto many{G4183} that were blind{G5185} he gave{G5483}{(G5662)} sight{G991}{(G5721)}."
Luke,7,22,"Then{G2532} Jesus{G2424} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Go your way{G4198}{(G5679)}, and tell{G518}{(G5657)} John{G2491} what things{G3739} ye have seen{G1492}{(G5627)} and{G2532} heard{G191}{(G5656)}; how{G3754} that the blind{G5185} see{G308}{(G5719)}, the lame{G5560} walk{G4043}{(G5719)}, the lepers{G3015} are cleansed{G2511}{(G5743)}, the deaf{G2974} hear{G191}{(G5719)}, the dead{G3498} are raised{G1453}{(G5743)}, to the poor{G4434} the gospel is preached{G2097}{(G5743)}."
Luke,7,23,"And{G2532} blessed{G3107} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he, whosoever{G3739} shall{G4624} not{G3362} be offended{G4624}{(G5686)} in{G1722} me{G1698}."
Luke,7,24,"And{G1161} when the messengers{G32} of John{G2491} were departed{G565}{(G5631)}, he began{G756}{(G5662)} to speak{G3004}{(G5721)} unto{G4314} the people{G3793} concerning{G4012} John{G2491}, What{G5101} went ye out{G1831}{(G5758)} into{G1519} the wilderness{G2048} for to see{G2300}{(G5664)}?

Luke,7,30,"But{G1161} the Pharisees{G5330} and{G2532} lawyers{G3544} rejected{G114}{(G5656)} the counsel{G1012} of God{G2316} against{G1519} themselves{G1438}, being{G907} not{G3361} baptized{G907}{(G5685)} of{G5259} him{G846}."
Luke,7,31,"And{G1161} the Lord{G2962} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Whereunto{G5101} then{G3767} shall I liken{G3666}{(G5692)} the men{G444} of this{G5026} generation{G1074}? and{G2532} to what{G5101} are they{G1526}{(G5748)} like{G3664}?"

Luke,8,9,"And{G1161} his{G846} disciples{G3101} asked{G1905}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, What{G5101} might{G1498} this{G3778} parable{G3850} be{G1498}{(G5751)}?"
Luke,8,10,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Unto you{G5213} it is given{G1325}{(G5769)} to know{G1097}{(G5629)} the mysteries{G3466} of the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}: but{G1161} to others{G3062} in{G1722} parables{G3850}; that{G2443} seeing{G991}{(G5723)} they might{G991} not{G3361} see{G991}{(G5725)}, and{G2532} hearing{G191}{(G5723)} they might{G4920} not{G3361} understand{G4920}{(G5725)}."
Luke,8,11,Now{G1161} the parable{G3850} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778}: The seed{G4703} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the word{G3056} of God{G2316}.
Luke,8,12,"Those{G1161} by{G3844} the way side{G3598} are{G1526}{(G5748)} they that hear{G191}{(G5723)}; then{G1534} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} the devil{G1228}, and{G2532} taketh away{G142}{(G5719)} the word{G3056} out of{G575} their{G846} hearts{G2588}, lest{G3363} they should believe{G4100}{(G5660)} and be saved{G4982}{(G5686)}."
Luke,8,13,"{G1161} They on{G1909} the rock{G4073} are they, which{G3739}, when{G3752} they hear{G191}{(G5661)}, receive{G1209}{(G5736)} the word{G3056} with{G3326} joy{G5479}; and{G2532} these{G3778} have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} root{G4491}, which{G3739} for{G4314} a while{G2540} believe{G4100}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} in{G1722} time{G2540} of temptation{G3986} fall away{G868}{(G5736)}."
Luke,8,14,"And{G1161} that which fell{G4098}{(G5631)} among{G1519} thorns{G173} are{G1526}{(G5748)} they{G3778}, which, when they have heard{G191}{(G5660)}, go forth{G4198}{(G5740)}, and{G2532} are choked{G4846}{(G5743)} with{G5259} cares{G3308} and{G2532} riches{G4149} and{G2532} pleasures{G2237} of this life{G979}, and{G2532} bring{G5052} no{G3756} fruit to perfection{G5052}{(G5719)}."
Luke,8,15,"But{G1161} that on{G1722} the good{G2570} ground{G1093} are{G1526}{(G5748)} they{G3778}, which{G3748} in{G1722} an honest{G2570} and{G2532} good{G18} heart{G2588}, having heard{G191}{(G5660)} the word{G3056}, keep{G2722}{(G5719)} it, and{G2532} bring forth fruit{G2592}{(G5719)} with{G1722} patience{G5281}."
Luke,8,16,"{G1161} No man{G3762}, when he hath lighted{G681}{(G5660)} a candle{G3088}, covereth{G2572}{(G5719)} it{G846} with a vessel{G4632}, or{G2228} putteth{G5087}{(G5719)} it under{G5270} a bed{G2825}; but{G235} setteth{G2007}{(G5719)} it on{G1909} a candlestick{G3087}, that{G2443} they which enter in{G1531}{(G5740)} may see{G991}{(G5725)} the light{G5457}."
Luke,8,17,"For{G1063} nothing{G3756} is{G2076}{(G5748)} secret{G2927}, that{G3739} shall{G1096} not{G3756} be made{G1096}{(G5695)} manifest{G5318}; neither{G3761} any thing hid{G614}, that{G3739} shall{G1097} not{G3756} be known{G1097}{(G5701)} and{G2532} come{G2064}{(G5632)} abroad{G1519}{G5318}."
Luke,8,18,"Take heed{G991}{(G5720)} therefore{G3767} how{G4459} ye hear{G191}{(G5719)}: for{G1063} whosoever{G3739}{G302} hath{G2192}{(G5725)}, to him{G846} shall be given{G1325}{(G5701)}; and{G2532} whosoever{G3739}{G302} hath{G2192}{(G5725)} not{G3361}, from{G575} him{G846} shall be taken{G142}{(G5701)} even{G2532} that which{G3739} he seemeth{G1380}{(G5719)} to have{G2192}{(G5721)}."
Luke,8,19,"Then{G1161} came{G3854}{(G5633)} to{G4314} him{G846} his mother{G3384} and{G2532} his{G846} brethren{G80}, and{G2532} could{G1410}{(G5711)} not{G3756} come{G4940}{(G5629)} at him{G846} for{G1223} the press{G3793}."
Luke,8,20,"And{G2532} it was told{G518}{(G5648)} him{G846} by certain which said{G3004}{(G5723)}, Thy{G4675} mother{G3384} and{G2532} thy{G4675} brethren{G80} stand{G2476}{(G5758)} without{G1854}, desiring{G2309}{(G5723)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} thee{G4571}."
Luke,8,21,"And{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, My{G3450} mother{G3384} and{G2532} my{G3450} brethren{G80} are{G1526}{(G5748)} these{G3778} which{G3588} hear{G191}{(G5723)} the word{G3056} of God{G2316}, and{G2532} do{G4160}{(G5723)} it{G846}."
Luke,8,22,"Now{G2532} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)} on{G1722} a certain{G3391} day{G2250}, that{G2532} he{G846} went{G1684}{(G5627)} into{G1519} a ship{G4143} with{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101}: and{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, Let us go over{G1330}{(G5632)} unto{G1519} the other side{G4008} of the lake{G3041}. And{G2532} they launched forth{G321}{(G5681)}."
Luke,8,23,"But{G1161} as they{G846} sailed{G4126}{(G5723)} he fell asleep{G879}{(G5656)}: and{G2532} there came down{G2597}{(G5627)} a storm{G2978} of wind{G417} on{G1519} the lake{G3041}; and{G2532} they were filled{G4845}{(G5712)} with water, and{G2532} were in jeopardy{G2793}{(G5707)}."
Luke,8,24,"And{G1161} they came to him{G4334}{(G5631)}, and awoke{G1326}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G1988}, master{G1988}, we perish{G622}{(G5731)}. Then{G1161} he arose{G1453}{(G5685)}, and rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} the wind{G417} and{G2532} the raging{G2830} of the water{G5204}: and{G2532} they ceased{G3973}{(G5668)}, and{G2532} there was{G1096}{(G5633)} a calm{G1055}."
Luke,8,25,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Where{G4226} is{G2076}{(G5748)} your{G5216} faith{G4102}? And{G1161} they being afraid{G5399}{(G5679)} wondered{G2296}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)} one to another{G4314}{G240}, What manner of man{G5101}{G686} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778}! for{G3754} he commandeth{G2004}{(G5719)} even{G2532} the winds{G417} and{G2532} water{G5204}, and{G2532} they obey{G5219}{(G5719)} him{G846}."
Luke,8,26,"And{G2532} they arrived{G2668}{(G5656)} at{G1519} the country{G5561} of the Gadarenes{G1046}, which{G3748} is{G2076}{(G5748)} over against{G495} Galilee{G1056}."
Luke,8,27,"And{G1161} when he{G846} went forth{G1831}{(G5631)} to{G1909} land{G1093}, there met{G5221}{(G5656)} him{G846} out of{G1537} the city{G4172} a certain{G5100} man{G435}, which{G3739} had{G2192}{(G5707)} devils{G1140} long{G1537}{G2425} time{G5550}, and{G2532} ware{G1737}{(G5710)} no{G3756} clothes{G2440}, neither{G2532}{G3756} abode{G3306}{(G5707)} in{G1722} any house{G3614}, but{G235} in{G1722} the tombs{G3418}."
Luke,8,28,"When{G1161} he saw{G1492}{(G5631)} Jesus{G2424}, he cried out{G349}{(G5660)}, and{G2532} fell down before{G4363}{(G5627)} him{G846}, and{G2532} with a loud{G3173} voice{G5456} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, What{G5101} have I{G1698} to do with{G2532} thee{G4671}, Jesus{G2424}, thou Son{G5207} of God{G2316} most high{G5310}? I beseech{G1189}{(G5736)} thee{G4675}, torment{G928}{(G5661)} me{G3165} not{G3361}."
Luke,8,29,"(For{G1063} he had commanded{G3853}{(G5707)}{(G5625)}{G3853}{(G5656)} the unclean{G169} spirit{G4151} to come{G1831}{(G5629)} out of{G575} the man{G444}. For{G1063} oftentimes{G4183}{G5550} it had caught{G4884}{(G5715)} him{G846}: and{G2532} he was kept{G5442}{(G5746)} bound{G1196}{(G5712)} with chains{G254} and{G2532} in fetters{G3976}; and{G2532} he brake{G1284}{(G5723)} the bands{G1199}, and was driven{G1643}{(G5712)} of{G5259} the devil{G1142} into{G1519} the wilderness{G2048}.)"
Luke,8,30,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, What{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} thy{G4671} name{G3686}? And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Legion{G3003}: because{G3754} many{G4183} devils{G1140} were entered{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} him{G846}."
Luke,8,31,And{G2532} they besought{G3870}{(G5707)}{(G5625)}{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} that{G3363} he would{G2004} not{G3363} command{G2004}{(G5661)} them{G846} to go out{G565}{(G5629)} into{G1519} the deep{G12}.
Luke,8,32,And{G1161} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} there{G1563} an herd{G34} of many{G2425} swine{G5519} feeding{G1006}{(G5746)} on{G1722} the mountain{G3735}: and{G2532} they besought{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} that{G2443} he would suffer{G2010}{(G5661)} them{G846} to enter{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} them{G1565}. And{G2532} he suffered{G2010}{(G5656)} them{G846}.
Luke,8,33,"Then{G1161} went{G1831}{(G5631)} the devils{G1140} out of{G575} the man{G444}, and entered{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the swine{G5519}: and{G2532} the herd{G34} ran{G3729}{(G5656)} violently down{G2596} a steep{G2911} place into{G1519} the lake{G3041}, and{G2532} were choked{G638}{(G5648)}."
Luke,8,34,"When{G1161} they that fed{G1006}{(G5723)} them saw{G1492}{(G5631)} what was done{G1096}{(G5772)}, they fled{G5343}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} went{G565}{(G5631)} and told{G518}{(G5656)} it in{G1519} the city{G4172} and{G2532} in{G1519} the country{G68}."
Luke,8,35,"Then{G1161} they went out{G1831}{(G5627)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} what was done{G1096}{(G5756)}; and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} to{G4314} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} found{G2147}{(G5627)} the man{G444}, out of{G575} whom{G3739} the devils{G1140} were departed{G1831}{(G5715)}, sitting{G2521}{(G5740)} at{G3844} the feet{G4228} of Jesus{G2424}, clothed{G2439}{(G5772)}, and{G2532} in his right mind{G4993}{(G5723)}: and{G2532} they were afraid{G5399}{(G5675)}."
Luke,8,36,{G1161} They also{G2532} which saw{G1492}{(G5631)} it told{G518}{(G5656)} them{G846} by what means{G4459} he that was possessed of the devils{G1139}{(G5679)} was healed{G4982}{(G5681)}.
Luke,8,37,"Then{G2532} the whole{G537} multitude{G4128} of the country{G4066} of the Gadarenes{G1046} round about{G4066} besought{G2065}{(G5656)} him{G846} to depart{G565}{(G5629)} from{G575} them{G846}; for{G3754} they were taken{G4912}{(G5712)} with great{G3173} fear{G5401}: and{G1161} he{G846} went up{G1684}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the ship{G4143}, and returned back again{G5290}{(G5656)}."
Luke,8,38,"Now{G1161} the man{G435} out of{G575} whom{G3739} the devils{G1140} were departed{G1831}{(G5715)} besought{G1189}{(G5711)} him{G846} that he might be{G1511}{(G5750)} with{G4862} him{G846}: but{G1161} Jesus{G2424} sent{G630} him{G846} away{G630}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Luke,8,39,"Return{G5290}{(G5720)} to{G1519} thine own{G4675} house{G3624}, and{G2532} shew{G1334}{(G5737)} how great things{G3745} God{G2316} hath done{G4160}{(G5656)} unto thee{G4671}. And{G2532} he went his way{G565}{(G5627)}, and published{G2784}{(G5723)} throughout{G2596} the whole{G3650} city{G4172} how great things{G3745} Jesus{G2424} had done{G4160}{(G5656)} unto him{G846}."
Luke,8,40,"And{G1161} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, that, when{G1722} Jesus{G2424} was returned{G5290}{(G5658)}, the people{G3793} gladly received{G588}{(G5662)} him{G846}: for{G1063} they were{G2258}{(G5713)} all{G3956} waiting for{G4328}{(G5723)} him{G846}."
Luke,8,41,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, there came{G2064}{(G5627)} a man{G435} named{G3739}{G3686} Jairus{G2383}, and{G2532} he{G846} was{G5225}{(G5707)} a ruler{G758} of the synagogue{G4864}: and{G2532} he fell down{G4098}{(G5631)} at{G3844} Jesus{G2424}' feet{G4228}, and besought{G3870}{(G5707)} him{G846} that he would come{G1525}{(G5629)} into{G1519} his{G846} house{G3624}:"
Luke,8,42,"For{G3754} he{G846} had{G2258}{(G5713)} one only{G3439} daughter{G2364}, about{G5613} twelve{G1427} years of age{G2094}, and{G2532} she{G3778}{(G5625)}{G846} lay a dying{G599}{(G5707)}. But{G1161} as{G1722} he{G846} went{G5217}{(G5721)} the people{G3793} thronged{G4846}{(G5707)} him{G846}."
Luke,8,43,"And{G2532} a woman{G1135} having{G5607}{(G5752)}{G1722} an issue{G4511} of blood{G129} twelve{G1427} years{G575}{G2094}, which{G3748} had spent{G4321}{(G5660)} all{G3650} her living{G979} upon{G1519} physicians{G2395}, neither{G3756} could{G2480}{(G5656)} be healed{G2323}{(G5683)} of{G5259} any{G3762},"
Luke,8,44,"Came{G4334}{(G5631)} behind{G3693} him, and touched{G680}{(G5662)} the border{G2899} of his{G846} garment{G2440}: and{G2532} immediately{G3916} her{G846} issue{G4511} of blood{G129} stanched{G2476}{(G5627)}."
Luke,8,45,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Who{G5101} touched{G680}{(G5671)} me{G3450}? When{G1161} all{G3956} denied{G720}{(G5740)}, Peter{G4074} and{G2532} they that were with{G3326} him{G846} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Master{G1988}, the multitude{G3793} throng{G4912}{(G5719)} thee{G4571} and{G2532} press{G598}{(G5719)} thee, and{G2532} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} thou, Who{G5101} touched{G680}{(G5671)} me{G3450}?"
Luke,8,46,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Somebody{G5100} hath touched{G680}{(G5662)} me{G3450}: for{G1063} I{G1473} perceive{G1097}{(G5627)} that virtue{G1411} is gone{G1831}{(G5631)} out of{G575} me{G1700}."
Luke,8,47,"And{G1161} when the woman{G1135} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} that{G3754} she was{G2990} not{G3756} hid{G2990}{(G5627)}, she came{G2064}{(G5627)} trembling{G5141}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} falling down before{G4363}{(G5631)} him{G846}, she declared{G518}{(G5656)} unto him{G846} before{G1799} all{G3956} the people{G2992} for{G1223} what{G3739} cause{G156} she had touched{G680}{(G5662)} him{G846}, and{G2532} how{G5613} she was healed{G2390}{(G5681)} immediately{G3916}."
Luke,8,48,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, Daughter{G2364}, be of good comfort{G2293}{(G5720)}: thy{G4675} faith{G4102} hath made{G4982} thee{G4571} whole{G4982}{(G5758)}; go{G4198}{(G5737)} in{G1519} peace{G1515}."
Luke,8,49,"While he{G846} yet{G2089} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, there cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} one{G5100} from{G3844} the ruler of the synagogue's{G752} house, saying{G3004}{(G5723)} to him{G846},{G3754} Thy{G4675} daughter{G2364} is dead{G2348}{(G5758)}; trouble{G4660}{(G5720)} not{G3361} the Master{G1320}."
Luke,8,50,"But{G1161} when Jesus{G2424} heard{G191}{(G5660)} it, he answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Fear{G5399}{(G5737)} not{G3361}: believe{G4100}{(G5720)} only{G3440}, and{G2532} she shall be made whole{G4982}{(G5701)}."
Luke,8,51,"And{G1161} when he came{G1525}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the house{G3614}, he suffered{G863}{(G5656)} no{G3756} man{G3762} to go in{G1525}{(G5629)}, save{G1508} Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} James{G2385}, and{G2532} John{G2491}, and{G2532} the father{G3962} and{G2532} the mother{G3384} of the maiden{G3816}."
Luke,8,52,"And{G1161} all{G3956} wept{G2799}{(G5707)}, and{G2532} bewailed{G2875}{(G5710)} her{G846}: but{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Weep{G2799}{(G5720)} not{G3361}; she is{G599} not{G3756} dead{G599}{(G5627)}, but{G235} sleepeth{G2518}{(G5719)}."
Luke,8,53,"And{G2532} they laughed{G2606} him{G846} to scorn{G2606}{(G5707)}, knowing{G1492}{(G5761)} that{G3754} she was dead{G599}{(G5627)}."
Luke,8,54,"And{G1161} he{G846} put{G1544}{(G5631)} them all{G3956} out{G1854}, and{G2532} took{G2902}{(G5660)} her{G846} by the hand{G5495}, and called{G5455}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Maid{G3816}, arise{G1453}{(G5728)}."
Luke,8,55,"And{G2532} her{G846} spirit{G4151} came again{G1994}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} she arose{G450}{(G5627)} straightway{G3916}: and{G2532} he commanded{G1299}{(G5656)} to give{G1325}{(G5683)} her{G846} meat{G5315}{(G5629)}."
Luke,8,56,And{G2532} her{G846} parents{G1118} were astonished{G1839}{(G5627)}: but{G1161} he charged{G3853}{(G5656)} them{G846} that they should tell{G2036}{(G5629)} no man{G3367} what was done{G1096}{(G5756)}.
Luke,9,1,"Then{G1161} he called{G4779} his{G846} twelve{G1427} disciples{G3101} together{G4779}{(G5671)}, and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} them{G846} power{G1411} and authority{G1849} over{G1909} all{G3956} devils{G1140}, and{G2532} to cure{G2323}{(G5721)} diseases{G3554}."
Luke,9,2,"And{G2532} he sent{G649}{(G5656)} them{G846} to preach{G2784}{(G5721)} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}, and{G2532} to heal{G2390}{(G5738)} the sick{G770}{(G5723)}."
Luke,9,3,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, Take{G142}{(G5720)} nothing{G3367} for{G1519} your journey{G3598}, neither{G3383} staves{G4464}, nor{G3383} scrip{G4082}, neither{G3383} bread{G740}, neither{G3383} money{G694}; neither{G3383} have{G2192}{(G5721)} two{G1417} coats{G5509} apiece{G303}."

Luke,9,5,"And{G2532} whosoever{G3745}{G302} will{G1209} not{G3361} receive{G1209}{(G5667)} you{G5209}, when ye go{G1831}{(G5740)} out of{G575} that{G1565} city{G4172}, shake off{G660}{(G5657)} the very{G2532} dust{G2868} from{G575} your{G5216} feet{G4228} for{G1519} a testimony{G3142} against{G1909} them{G846}."
Luke,9,6,"And{G1161} they departed{G1831}{(G5740)}, and went{G1330}{(G5711)} through{G2596} the towns{G2968}, preaching the gospel{G2097}{(G5734)}, and{G2532} healing{G2323}{(G5723)} every where{G3837}."
Luke,9,7,"Now{G1161} Herod{G2264} the tetrarch{G5076} heard{G191}{(G5656)} of all{G3956} that was done{G1096}{(G5740)} by{G5259} him{G846}: and{G2532} he was perplexed{G1280}{(G5707)}, because{G1223} that it was said{G3004}{(G5745)} of{G5259} some{G5100}, that{G3754} John{G2491} was risen{G1453}{(G5769)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498};"
Luke,9,8,"And{G1161} of{G5259} some{G5100}, that{G3754} Elias{G2243} had appeared{G5316}{(G5648)}; and{G1161} of others{G243}, that{G3754} one{G1520} of the old{G744} prophets{G4396} was risen again{G450}{(G5627)}."
Luke,9,9,"And{G2532} Herod{G2264} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, John{G2491} have{G607} I{G1473} beheaded{G607}{(G5656)}: but{G1161} who{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778}, of{G4012} whom{G3739} I{G1473} hear{G191}{(G5719)} such things{G5108}? And{G2532} he desired{G2212}{(G5707)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} him{G846}."
Luke,9,10,"And{G2532} the apostles{G652}, when they were returned{G5290}{(G5660)}, told{G1334}{(G5662)} him{G846} all that{G3745} they had done{G4160}{(G5656)}. And{G2532} he took{G3880}{(G5631)} them{G846}, and went aside{G5298}{(G5656)} privately{G2596}{G2398} into{G1519} a desert{G2048} place{G5117} belonging to the city{G4172} called{G2564}{(G5746)} Bethsaida{G966}."
Luke,9,11,"And{G1161} the people{G3793}, when they knew{G1097}{(G5631)} it, followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}: and{G2532} he received{G1209}{(G5666)} them{G846}, and spake{G2980}{(G5707)} unto them{G846} of{G4012} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}, and{G2532} healed{G2390}{(G5711)} them that had{G2192}{(G5723)} need{G5532} of healing{G2322}."
Luke,9,12,"And{G1161} when the day{G2250} began{G756}{(G5662)} to wear away{G2827}{(G5721)}, then{G1161} came{G4334}{(G5631)} the twelve{G1427}, and said{G2036}{(G5632)} unto him{G846}, Send{G630} the multitude{G3793} away{G630}{(G5657)}, that{G2443} they may go{G565}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the towns{G2968} and{G2532} country{G68} round about{G2945}, and lodge{G2647}{(G5661)}, and{G2532} get{G2147}{(G5627)} victuals{G1979}: for{G3754} we are{G2070}{(G5748)} here{G5602} in{G1722} a desert{G2048} place{G5117}."
Luke,9,13,"But{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, Give{G1325}{(G5628)} ye{G5210} them{G846} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}. And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, We{G2254} have no{G3756}{G1526}{(G5748)} more{G4119} but{G2228} five{G4002} loaves{G740} and{G2532} two{G1417} fishes{G2486}; except{G1509} we{G2249} should go{G4198}{(G5679)} and buy{G59}{(G5661)} meat{G1033} for{G1519} all{G3956} this{G5126} people{G2992}."
Luke,9,14,"For{G1063} they were{G2258}{(G5713)} about{G5616} five thousand{G4000} men{G435}. And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} to{G4314} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Make{G2625} them{G846} sit down{G2625}{(G5657)} by{G303} fifties{G4004} in a company{G2828}."
Luke,9,15,"And{G2532} they did{G4160}{(G5656)} so{G3779}, and{G2532} made{G347} them all{G537} sit down{G347}{(G5656)}."
Luke,9,16,"Then{G1161} he took{G2983}{(G5631)} the five{G4002} loaves{G740} and{G2532} the two{G1417} fishes{G2486}, and looking up{G308}{(G5660)} to{G1519} heaven{G3772}, he blessed{G2127}{(G5656)} them{G846}, and{G2532} brake{G2622}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5707)} to the disciples{G3101} to set before{G3908}{(G5683)} the multitude{G3793}."
Luke,9,17,"And{G2532} they did eat{G5315}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} were{G5526} all{G3956} filled{G5526}{(G5681)}: and{G2532} there was taken up{G142}{(G5681)} of fragments{G2801} that remained{G4052}{(G5660)} to them{G846} twelve{G1427} baskets{G2894}."

Luke,9,38,"And,{G2532} behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, a man{G435} of{G575} the company{G3793} cried out{G310}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G1320}, I beseech{G1189}{(G5736)} thee{G4675}, look{G1914}{(G5657)} upon{G1909} my{G3450} son{G5207}: for{G3754} he is{G2076}{(G5748)} mine{G3427} only child{G3439}."
Luke,9,39,"And{G2532}, lo{G2400}{(G5628)}, a spirit{G4151} taketh{G2983}{(G5719)} him{G846}, and{G2532} he suddenly{G1810} crieth out{G2896}{(G5719)}; and{G2532} it teareth{G4682}{(G5719)} him{G846} that he foameth{G876} again{G3326}, and{G2532} bruising{G4937}{(G5723)} him{G846} hardly{G3425} departeth{G672}{(G5719)} from{G575} him{G846}."
Luke,9,40,And{G2532} I besought{G1189}{(G5681)} thy{G4675} disciples{G3101} to{G2443} cast{G1544} him{G846} out{G1544}{(G5725)}; and{G2532} they could{G1410}{(G5675)} not{G3756}.
Luke,9,41,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, O{G5599} faithless{G571} and{G2532} perverse{G1294}{(G5772)} generation{G1074}, how{G2193} long{G4219} shall I be{G2071}{(G5704)} with{G4314} you{G5209}, and{G2532} suffer{G430}{(G5695)} you{G5216}? Bring{G4317}{(G5628)} thy{G4675} son{G5207} hither{G5602}."
Luke,9,42,"And{G1161} as he{G846} was{G4334} yet{G2089} a coming{G4334}{(G5740)}, the devil{G1140} threw{G4486} him{G846} down{G4486}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} tare{G4952}{(G5656)} him. And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} the unclean{G169} spirit{G4151}, and{G2532} healed{G2390}{(G5662)} the child{G3816}, and{G2532} delivered{G591} him{G846} again{G591}{(G5656)} to his{G846} father{G3962}."
Luke,9,43,"And{G1161} they were{G1605} all{G3956} amazed{G1605}{(G5712)} at{G1909} the mighty power{G3168} of God{G2316}. But{G1161} while they wondered{G2296}{(G5723)} every one{G3956} at{G1909} all things{G3956} which{G3739} Jesus{G2424} did{G4160}{(G5656)}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} his{G846} disciples{G3101},"

Luke,9,45,"But{G1161} they understood not{G50}{(G5707)} this{G5124} saying{G4487}, and{G2532} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} hid{G3871}{(G5772)} from{G575} them{G846}, that{G3363} they perceived{G143}{(G5638)} it{G846} not{G3363}: and{G2532} they feared{G5399}{(G5711)} to ask{G2065}{(G5658)} him{G846} of{G4012} that{G5127} saying{G4487}."
Luke,9,46,"Then{G1161} there arose{G1525}{(G5627)} a reasoning{G1261} among{G1722} them{G846}, which{G5101}{G302} of them{G846} should be{G1498}{(G5751)} greatest{G3187}."
Luke,9,47,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424}, perceiving{G1492}{(G5631)} the thought{G1261} of their{G846} heart{G2588}, took{G1949}{(G5637)} a child{G3813}, and set{G2476}{(G5656)} him{G846} by{G3844} him{G1438},"
Luke,9,48,"And{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Whosoever{G3739}{G1437} shall receive{G1209}{(G5667)} this{G5124} child{G3813} in{G1909} my{G3450} name{G3686} receiveth{G1209}{(G5736)} me{G1691}: and{G2532} whosoever{G3739}{G1437} shall receive{G1209}{(G5667)} me{G1691} receiveth him{G1209}{(G5736)} that sent{G649}{(G5660)} me{G3165}: for{G1063} he that is{G5225}{(G5723)} least{G3398} among{G1722} you{G5213} all{G3956}, the same{G3778} shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} great{G3173}."
Luke,9,49,"And{G1161} John{G2491} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Master{G1988}, we saw{G1492}{(G5627)} one{G5100} casting out{G1544}{(G5723)} devils{G1140} in{G1909} thy{G4675} name{G3686}; and{G2532} we forbad{G2967}{(G5656)} him{G846}, because{G3754} he followeth{G190}{(G5719)} not{G3756} with{G3326} us{G2257}."
Luke,9,50,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Forbid{G2967}{(G5720)} him not{G3361}: for{G1063} he{G3739} that is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} against{G2596} us{G2257} is{G2076}{(G5748)} for{G5228} us{G2257}."
Luke,9,51,"And{G1161} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, when{G1722} the time{G2250} was come{G4845}{(G5745)} that he{G846} should be received up{G354},{G2532} he{G846} stedfastly set{G4741}{(G5656)} his{G846} face{G4383} to go{G4198}{(G5738)} to{G1519} Jerusalem{G2419},"

Luke,9,53,"And{G2532} they did{G1209} not{G3756} receive{G1209}{(G5662)} him{G846}, because{G3754} his{G846} face{G4383} was{G2258}{(G5713)} as though he would go{G4198}{(G5740)} to{G1519} Jerusalem{G2419}."
Luke,9,54,"And{G1161} when his{G846} disciples{G3101} James{G2385} and{G2532} John{G2491} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} this, they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Lord{G2962}, wilt thou{G2309}{(G5719)} that we command{G2036}{(G5632)} fire{G4442} to come down{G2597}{(G5629)} from{G575} heaven{G3772}, and{G2532} consume{G355}{(G5658)} them{G846}, even{G2532} as{G5613} Elias{G2243} did{G4160}{(G5656)}?"
Luke,9,55,"But{G1161} he turned{G4762}{(G5651)}, and rebuked{G2008}{(G5656)} them{G846}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Ye know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} what manner{G3634} of spirit{G4151} ye{G5210} are of{G2075}{(G5748)}."

Luke,14,9,"And{G2532} he that bade{G2564}{(G5660)} thee{G4571} and{G2532} him{G846} come{G2064}{(G5631)} and say{G2046}{(G5692)} to thee{G4671}, Give{G1325}{(G5628)} this man{G5129} place{G5117}; and{G2532}{G5119} thou begin{G756}{(G5672)} with{G3326} shame{G152} to take{G2722}{(G5721)} the lowest{G2078} room{G5117}."
Luke,14,10,"But{G235} when{G3752} thou art bidden{G2564}{(G5686)}, go{G4198}{(G5679)} and sit down{G377}{(G5657)} in{G1519} the lowest{G2078} room{G5117}; that{G2443} when{G3752} he that bade{G2564}{(G5761)} thee{G4571} cometh{G2064}{(G5632)}, he may say{G2036}{(G5632)} unto thee{G4671}, Friend{G5384}, go up{G4320}{(G5628)} higher{G511}: then{G5119} shalt thou{G4671} have{G2071}{(G5704)} worship{G1391} in the presence{G1799} of them that sit at meat{G4873}{(G5740)} with thee{G4671}."
Luke,14,11,For{G3754} whosoever{G3956} exalteth{G5312}{(G5723)} himself{G1438} shall be abased{G5013}{(G5701)}; and{G2532} he that humbleth{G5013}{(G5723)} himself{G1438} shall be exalted{G5312}{(G5701)}.
Luke,14,12,"Then{G1161} said he{G3004}{(G5707)} also{G2532} to him that bade{G2564}{(G5761)} him{G846}, When{G3752} thou makest{G4160}{(G5725)} a dinner{G712} or{G2228} a supper{G1173}, call{G5455}{(G5720)} not{G3361} thy{G4675} friends{G5384}, nor{G3366} thy{G4675} brethren{G80}, neither{G3366} thy{G4675} kinsmen{G4773}, nor{G3366} thy rich{G4145} neighbours{G1069}; lest{G3379} they{G846} also{G2532} bid{G479} thee{G4571} again{G479}{(G5661)}, and{G2532} a recompence{G468} be made{G1096}{(G5638)} thee{G4671}."
Luke,14,13,"But{G235} when{G3752} thou makest{G4160}{(G5725)} a feast{G1403}, call{G2564}{(G5720)} the poor{G4434}, the maimed{G376}, the lame{G5560}, the blind{G5185}:"

Luke,14,15,"And{G1161} when one{G5100} of them that sat at meat with him{G4873}{(G5740)} heard{G191}{(G5660)} these things{G5023}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Blessed{G3107} is he{G3739} that shall eat{G5315}{(G5695)} bread{G740} in{G1722} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}."
Luke,14,16,"Then{G1161} said he{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, A certain{G5100} man{G444} made{G4160}{(G5656)} a great{G3173} supper{G1173}, and{G2532} bade{G2564}{(G5656)} many{G4183}:"

Luke,14,18,"And{G2532} they all{G3956} with{G575} one{G3391} consent began{G756}{(G5662)} to make excuse{G3868}{(G5738)}. The first{G4413} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, I have bought{G59}{(G5656)} a piece of ground{G68}, and{G2532} I must{G2192}{(G5719)} needs{G318} go{G1831}{(G5629)} and{G2532} see{G1492}{(G5629)} it{G846}: I pray{G2065}{(G5719)} thee{G4571} have{G2192}{(G5720)} me{G3165} excused{G3868}{(G5772)}."

Then{G5119} the master of the house{G3617} being angry{G3710}{(G5685)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} to his{G846} servant{G1401}, Go out{G1831}{(G5628)} quickly{G5030} into{G1519} the streets{G4113} and{G2532} lanes{G4505} of the city{G4172}, and{G2532} bring in{G1521}{(G5628)} hither{G5602} the poor{G4434}, and{G2532} the maimed{G376}, and{G2532} the halt{G5560}, and{G2532} the blind{G5185}."

Luke,19,24,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them that stood by{G3936}{(G5761)}, Take{G142}{(G5657)} from{G575} him{G846} the pound{G3414}, and{G2532} give{G1325}{(G5628)} it to him that hath{G2192}{(G5723)} ten{G1176} pounds{G3414}."

Luke,20,10,"And{G2532} at{G1722} the season{G2540} he sent{G649}{(G5656)} a servant{G1401} to{G4314} the husbandmen{G1092}, that{G2443} they should give{G1325}{(G5632)} him{G846} of{G575} the fruit{G2590} of the vineyard{G290}: but{G1161} the husbandmen{G1092} beat{G1194}{(G5660)} him{G846}, and sent him away{G1821}{(G5656)} empty{G2756}."

Luke,20,19,And{G2532} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the scribes{G1122} the same{G1722}{G846} hour{G5610} sought{G2212}{(G5656)} to lay{G1911}{(G5629)} hands{G5495} on{G1909} him{G846}; and{G2532} they feared{G5399}{(G5675)} the people{G2992}: for{G1063} they perceived{G1097}{(G5627)} that{G3754} he had spoken{G2036}{(G5627)} this{G5026} parable{G3850} against{G4314} them{G846}.
Luke,20,20,"And{G2532} they watched{G3906}{(G5660)} him, and sent forth{G649}{(G5656)} spies{G1455}, which should feign{G5271}{(G5740)}{G1511}{(G5750)} themselves{G1438} just men{G1342}, that{G2443} they might take hold{G1949}{(G5638)} of his{G846} words{G3056}, that so{G1519} they might deliver{G3860}{(G5629)} him{G846} unto the power{G746} and{G2532} authority{G1849} of the governor{G2232}."
Luke,20,21,"And{G2532} they asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G1320}, we know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} thou sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} and{G2532} teachest{G1321}{(G5719)} rightly{G3723},{G2532} neither{G3756} acceptest thou{G2983}{(G5719)} the person{G4383} of any, but{G235} teachest{G1321}{(G5719)} the way{G3598} of God{G2316} truly{G225}{G1909}:"
Luke,20,22,"Is it lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} for us{G2254} to give{G1325}{(G5629)} tribute{G5411} unto Caesar{G2541}, or{G2228} no{G3756}?"
Luke,20,23,"But{G1161} he perceived{G2657}{(G5660)} their{G846} craftiness{G3834}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, Why{G5101} tempt ye{G3985}{(G5719)} me{G3165}?"
Luke,20,24,"Shew{G1925}{(G5657)} me{G3427} a penny{G1220}. Whose{G5101} image{G1504} and{G2532} superscription{G1923} hath it{G2192}{(G5719)}? They answered{G611}{(G5679)} and{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Caesar's{G2541}."
Luke,20,25,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Render{G591}{(G5628)} therefore{G5106} unto Caesar{G2541} the things which be{G3588} Caesar's{G2541}, and{G2532} unto God{G2316} the things which be{G3588} God's{G2316}."
Luke,20,26,"And{G2532} they could{G2480}{(G5656)} not{G3756} take hold{G1949}{(G5635)} of his{G846} words{G4487} before{G1726} the people{G2992}: and{G2532} they marvelled{G2296}{(G5660)} at{G1909} his{G846} answer{G612}, and held their peace{G4601}{(G5656)}."
Luke,20,27,"Then{G1161} came{G4334}{(G5631)} to him certain{G5100} of the Sadducees{G4523}, which{G3588} deny{G483}{(G5723)} that there is{G1511}{(G5750)} any{G3361} resurrection{G386}; and they asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846},"
Luke,20,28,"Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G1320}, Moses{G3475} wrote{G1125}{(G5656)} unto us{G2254}, If{G1437} any man's{G5100} brother{G80} die{G599}{(G5632)}, having{G2192}{(G5723)} a wife{G1135}, and{G2532} he{G3778} die{G599}{(G5632)} without children{G815}, that{G2443} his{G846} brother{G80} should take{G2983}{(G5632)} his wife{G1135}, and{G2532} raise up{G1817}{(G5661)} seed{G4690} unto his{G846} brother{G80}."
Luke,20,29,"There were{G2258}{(G5713)} therefore{G3767} seven{G2033} brethren{G80}: and{G2532} the first{G4413} took{G2983}{(G5631)} a wife{G1135}, and died{G599}{(G5627)} without children{G815}."
Luke,20,30,"And{G2532} the second{G1208} took{G2983}{(G5627)} her to wife{G1135}, and{G2532} he{G3778} died{G599}{(G5627)} childless{G815}."
Luke,20,31,"And{G2532} the third{G5154} took{G2983}{(G5627)} her{G846}; and{G1161} in like manner{G5615} the seven{G2033} also{G2532}: and they left{G2641}{(G5627)} no{G3756} children{G5043}, and{G2532} died{G599}{(G5627)}."
Luke,20,32,{G1161} Last{G5305} of all{G3956} the woman{G1135} died{G599}{(G5627)} also{G2532}.
Luke,20,33,Therefore{G3767} in{G1722} the resurrection{G386} whose{G5101} wife{G1135} of them{G846} is she{G1096}{(G5736)}? for{G1063} seven{G2033} had{G2192}{(G5627)} her{G846} to wife{G1135}.
Luke,20,34,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, The children{G5207} of this{G5127} world{G165} marry{G1060}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} are given in marriage{G1548}{(G5743)}:"
Luke,20,35,"But{G1161} they which shall be accounted worthy{G2661}{(G5685)} to obtain{G5177}{(G5629)} that{G1565} world{G165}, and{G2532} the resurrection{G386} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}, neither{G3777} marry{G1060}{(G5719)}, nor{G3777} are given in marriage{G1548}{(G5743)}:"
Luke,20,36,"Neither{G3777}{G1063} can{G1410}{(G5736)} they die{G599}{(G5629)} any more{G2089}: for{G1063} they are{G1526}{(G5748)} equal unto the angels{G2465}; and{G2532} are{G1526}{(G5748)} the children{G5207} of God{G2316}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} the children{G5207} of the resurrection{G386}."
Luke,20,37,"Now{G1161} that{G3754} the dead{G3498} are raised{G1453}{(G5743)}, even{G2532} Moses{G3475} shewed{G3377}{(G5656)} at{G1909} the bush{G942}, when{G5613} he calleth{G3004}{(G5719)} the Lord{G2962} the God{G2316} of Abraham{G11}, and{G2532} the God{G2316} of Isaac{G2464}, and{G2532} the God{G2316} of Jacob{G2384}."
Luke,20,38,"For{G1161} he is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} a God{G2316} of the dead{G3498}, but{G235} of the living{G2198}{(G5723)}: for{G1063} all{G3956} live{G2198}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}."
Luke,20,39,"Then{G1161} certain{G5100} of the scribes{G1122} answering{G611}{(G5679)} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Master{G1320}, thou hast well{G2573} said{G2036}{(G5627)}."
Luke,20,40,And{G1161} after that{G3765} they durst{G5111}{(G5707)} not{G3765} ask{G1905}{(G5721)} him{G846} any{G3762} question at all.
Luke,20,41,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, How{G4459} say{G3004}{(G5719)} they that Christ{G5547} is{G1511}{(G5750)} David's{G1138} son{G5207}?"
Luke,20,42,"And{G2532} David{G1138} himself{G846} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} in{G1722} the book{G976} of Psalms{G5568}, The LORD{G2962} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto my{G3450} Lord{G2962}, Sit thou{G2521}{(G5737)} on{G1537} my{G3450} right hand{G1188},"

Luke,21,1,"And{G1161} he looked up{G308}{(G5660)}, and saw{G1492}{(G5627)} the rich men{G4145} casting{G906}{(G5723)} their{G846} gifts{G1435} into{G1519} the treasury{G1049}."
Luke,21,2,And{G1161} he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} also{G2532} a certain{G5100} poor{G3998} widow{G5503} casting{G906}{(G5723)} in thither{G1563} two{G1417} mites{G3016}.

Luke,21,5,"And{G2532} as some{G5100} spake{G3004}{(G5723)} of{G4012} the temple{G2411}, how{G3754} it was adorned{G2885}{(G5769)} with goodly{G2570} stones{G3037} and{G2532} gifts{G334}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)},"

Luke,21,30,"When{G3752} they now{G2235} shoot forth{G4261}{(G5632)}, ye see{G991}{(G5723)} and know{G1097}{(G5719)} of{G575} your own selves{G1438} that{G3754} summer{G2330} is{G2076}{(G5748)} now{G2235} nigh at hand{G1451}."
Luke,21,31,"So{G3779} likewise{G2532} ye{G5210}, when{G3752} ye see{G1492}{(G5632)} these things{G5023} come to pass{G1096}{(G5740)}, know ye{G1097}{(G5720)} that{G3754} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316} is{G2076}{(G5748)} nigh at hand{G1451}."
Luke,21,32,"Verily{G281} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} This{G3778} generation{G1074} shall{G3928} not{G3364} pass away{G3928}{(G5632)},{G302} till{G2193} all{G3956} be fulfilled{G1096}{(G5638)}."
Luke,21,33,Heaven{G3772} and{G2532} earth{G1093} shall pass away{G3928}{(G5695)}: but{G1161} my{G3450} words{G3056} shall{G3928} not{G3364} pass away{G3928}{(G5632)}.
Luke,21,34,"And{G1161} take heed{G4337}{(G5720)} to yourselves{G1438}, lest at any time{G3379} your{G5216} hearts{G2588} be overcharged{G925}{(G5686)} with{G1722} surfeiting{G2897}, and{G2532} drunkenness{G3178}, and{G2532} cares{G3308} of this life{G982}, and{G2532} so that{G1565} day{G2250} come{G2186}{(G5632)} upon{G1909} you{G5209} unawares{G160}."
Luke,21,35,For{G1063} as{G5613} a snare{G3803} shall it come{G1904}{(G5695)} on{G1909} all{G3956} them that dwell{G2521}{(G5740)} on{G1909} the face{G4383} of the whole{G3956} earth{G1093}.
Luke,21,36,"Watch ye{G69}{(G5720)} therefore{G3767}, and pray{G1189}{(G5740)} always{G1722}{G3956}{G2540}, that{G2443} ye may be accounted worthy{G2661}{(G5686)} to escape{G1628}{(G5629)} all{G3956} these things{G5023} that shall{G3195}{(G5723)} come to pass{G1096}{(G5738)}, and{G2532} to stand{G2476}{(G5683)} before{G1715} the Son{G5207} of man{G444}."
Luke,21,37,"And{G1161} in the day time{G2250} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} teaching{G1321}{(G5723)} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}; and{G1161} at night{G3571} he went out{G1831}{(G5740)}, and abode{G835}{(G5711)} in{G1519} the mount{G3735} that is called{G2564}{(G5746)} the mount of Olives{G1636}."
Luke,21,38,"And{G2532} all{G3956} the people{G2992} came early in the morning{G3719}{(G5707)} to{G4314} him{G846} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}, for to hear{G191}{(G5721)} him{G846}."
Luke,22,1,"Now{G1161} the feast{G1859} of unleavened bread{G106} drew nigh{G1448}{(G5707)}, which is called{G3004}{(G5746)} the Passover{G3957}."
Luke,22,2,And{G2532} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} scribes{G1122} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} how{G4459} they might kill{G337}{(G5661)} him{G846}; for{G1063} they feared{G5399}{(G5711)} the people{G2992}.
Luke,22,3,"Then{G1161} entered{G1525}{(G5627)} Satan{G4567} into{G1519} Judas{G2455} surnamed{G1941}{(G5746)} Iscariot{G2469}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} of{G1537} the number{G706} of the twelve{G1427}."
Luke,22,4,"And{G2532} he went his way{G565}{(G5631)}, and communed with{G4814}{(G5656)} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} captains{G4755}, how{G4459} he might betray{G3860}{(G5632)} him{G846} unto them{G846}."
Luke,22,5,"And{G2532} they were glad{G5463}{(G5644)}, and{G2532} covenanted{G4934}{(G5639)} to give{G1325}{(G5629)} him{G846} money{G694}."
Luke,22,6,"And{G2532} he promised{G1843}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} opportunity{G2120} to betray{G3860}{(G5629)} him{G846} unto them{G846} in the absence{G817} of the multitude{G3793}."
Luke,22,7,"Then{G1161} came{G2064}{(G5627)} the day{G2250} of unleavened bread{G106}, when{G1722}{G3739} the passover{G3957} must{G1163}{(G5713)} be killed{G2380}{(G5745)}."
Luke,22,8,"And{G2532} he sent{G649}{(G5656)} Peter{G4074} and{G2532} John{G2491}, saying{G2036}{(G5631)}, Go{G4198}{(G5679)} and prepare{G2090}{(G5657)} us{G2254} the passover{G3957}, that{G2443} we may eat{G5315}{(G5632)}."
Luke,22,9,"And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Where{G4226} wilt thou{G2309}{(G5719)} that we prepare{G2090}{(G5661)}?"
Luke,22,10,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, when ye{G5216} are entered{G1525}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the city{G4172}, there shall{G4876} a man{G444} meet{G4876}{(G5692)} you{G5213}, bearing{G941}{(G5723)} a pitcher{G2765} of water{G5204}; follow{G190}{(G5657)} him{G846} into{G1519} the house{G3614} where{G3757} he entereth in{G1531}{(G5736)}."
Luke,22,11,"And{G2532} ye shall say{G2046}{(G5692)} unto the goodman{G3617} of the house{G3614}, The Master{G1320} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, Where{G4226} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the guestchamber{G2646}, where{G3699} I shall eat{G5315}{(G5632)} the passover{G3957} with{G3326} my{G3450} disciples{G3101}?"
Luke,22,12,And{G2548} he shall shew{G1166}{(G5692)} you{G5213} a large{G3173} upper room{G508} furnished{G4766}{(G5772)}: there{G1563} make ready{G2090}{(G5657)}.
Luke,22,13,"And{G1161} they went{G565}{(G5631)}, and found{G2147}{(G5627)} as{G2531} he had said{G2046}{(G5758)} unto them{G846}: and{G2532} they made ready{G2090}{(G5656)} the passover{G3957}."
Luke,22,14,"And{G2532} when{G3753} the hour{G5610} was come{G1096}{(G5633)}, he sat down{G377}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} the twelve{G1427} apostles{G652} with{G4862} him{G846}."
Luke,22,15,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, With desire{G1939} I have desired{G1937}{(G5656)} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)} this{G5124} passover{G3957} with{G3326} you{G5216} before{G4253} I{G3165} suffer{G3958}{(G5629)}:"
Luke,22,16,"For{G1063} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} I will{G5315} not{G3765} any more{G3364} eat{G5315}{(G5632)} thereof{G846}{G1537}, until{G2193}{G3755} it be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)} in{G1722} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316}."
Luke,22,17,"And{G2532} he took{G1209}{(G5666)} the cup{G4221}, and gave thanks{G2168}{(G5660)}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Take{G2983}{(G5628)} this{G5124}, and{G2532} divide{G1266}{(G5657)} it among yourselves{G1438}:"
Luke,22,18,"For{G1063} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} I will{G4095} not{G3364} drink{G4095}{(G5632)} of{G575} the fruit{G1081} of the vine{G288}, until{G2193}{G3755} the kingdom{G932} of God{G2316} shall come{G2064}{(G5632)}."
Luke,22,19,"And{G2532} he took{G2983}{(G5631)} bread{G740}, and gave thanks{G2168}{(G5660)}, and brake{G2806}{(G5656)} it, and{G2532} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} unto them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, This{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} my{G3450} body{G4983} which{G3588} is given{G1325}{(G5746)} for{G5228} you{G5216}: this{G5124} do{G4160}{(G5720)} in remembrance{G364} of{G1519} me{G1699}."
Luke,22,20,"Likewise{G5615} also{G2532} the cup{G4221} after{G3326} supper{G1172}{(G5658)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, This{G5124} cup{G4221} is the new{G2537} testament{G1242} in{G1722} my{G3450} blood{G129}, which{G3588} is shed{G1632}{(G5746)} for{G5228} you{G5216}."
Luke,22,21,"But{G4133}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, the hand{G5495} of him that betrayeth{G3860}{(G5723)} me{G3165} is with{G3326} me{G1700} on{G1909} the table{G5132}."
Luke,22,22,"And{G2532} truly{G3303} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} goeth{G4198}{(G5736)}, as{G2596} it was determined{G3724}{(G5772)}: but{G4133} woe{G3759} unto that{G1565} man{G444} by{G1223} whom{G3739} he is betrayed{G3860}{(G5743)}!"
Luke,22,23,"And{G2532} they{G846} began{G756}{(G5662)} to enquire{G4802}{(G5721)} among{G4314} themselves{G1438}, which{G5101}{G686} of{G1537} them{G846} it was{G1498}{(G5751)} that should{G3195}{(G5723)} do{G4238}{(G5721)} this thing{G5124}."
Luke,22,24,"And{G1161} there was{G1096}{(G5633)} also{G2532} a strife{G5379} among{G1722} them{G846}, which{G5101} of them{G846} should be accounted{G1380}{(G5719)}{G1511}{(G5750)} the greatest{G3187}."
Luke,22,25,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, The kings{G935} of the Gentiles{G1484} exercise lordship over{G2961}{(G5719)} them{G846}; and{G2532} they that exercise authority upon{G1850}{(G5723)} them{G846} are called{G2564}{(G5743)} benefactors{G2110}."
Luke,22,26,"But{G1161} ye{G5210} shall not{G3756} be so{G3779}: but{G235} he that is greatest{G3187} among{G1722} you{G5213}, let him be{G1096}{(G5634)} as{G5613} the younger{G3501}; and{G2532} he that is chief{G2233}{(G5740)}, as{G5613} he that doth serve{G1247}{(G5723)}."
Luke,22,27,"For{G1063} whether{G5101} is greater{G3187}, he that sitteth at meat{G345}{(G5740)}, or{G2228} he that serveth{G1247}{(G5723)}? is not{G3780} he that sitteth at meat{G345}{(G5740)}? but{G1161} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} among{G1722}{G3319} you{G5216} as{G5613} he that serveth{G1247}{(G5723)}."
Luke,22,28,{G1161} Ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} they which have continued{G1265}{(G5761)} with{G3326} me{G1700} in{G1722} my{G3450} temptations{G3986}.
Luke,22,29,"And I{G2504} appoint{G1303}{(G5731)} unto you{G5213} a kingdom{G932}, as{G2531} my{G3450} Father{G3962} hath appointed{G1303}{(G5639)} unto me{G3427};"
Luke,22,30,"That{G2443} ye may eat{G2068}{(G5725)} and{G2532} drink{G4095}{(G5725)} at{G1909} my{G3450} table{G5132} in{G1722} my{G3450} kingdom{G932}, and{G2532} sit{G2523}{(G5667)} on{G1909} thrones{G2362} judging{G2919}{(G5723)} the twelve{G1427} tribes{G5443} of Israel{G2474}."
Luke,22,31,"And{G1161} the Lord{G2962} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Simon{G4613}, Simon{G4613}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, Satan{G4567} hath desired{G1809}{(G5668)} to have you{G5209}, that he may sift{G4617}{(G5658)} you as{G5613} wheat{G4621}:"
Luke,22,32,"But{G1161} I{G1473} have prayed{G1189}{(G5681)} for{G4012} thee{G4675}, that{G3363} thy{G4675} faith{G4102} fail{G1587}{(G5725)} not{G3363}: and{G2532} when{G4218} thou{G4771} art converted{G1994}{(G5660)}, strengthen{G4741}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} brethren{G80}."
Luke,22,33,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} ready{G2092} to go{G4198}{(G5738)} with{G3326} thee{G4675}, both{G2532} into{G1519} prison{G5438}, and{G2532} to{G1519} death{G2288}."
Luke,22,34,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I tell{G3004}{(G5719)} thee{G4671}, Peter{G4074}, the cock{G220} shall{G5455} not{G3364} crow{G5455}{(G5692)} this day{G4594}, before that{G4250} thou shalt{G2228} thrice{G5151} deny{G533}{(G5695)} that thou{G3361} knowest{G1492}{(G5760)} me{G3165}."
Luke,22,35,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, When{G3753} I sent{G649}{(G5656)} you{G5209} without{G817} purse{G905}, and{G2532} scrip{G4082}, and{G2532} shoes{G5266},{G3361} lacked ye{G5302}{(G5656)} any thing{G5100}? And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Nothing{G3762}."
Luke,22,36,"Then{G3767} said he{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, But{G235} now{G3568}, he that hath{G2192}{(G5723)} a purse{G905}, let him take{G142}{(G5657)} it, and{G2532} likewise{G3668} his scrip{G4082}: and{G2532} he that hath{G2192}{(G5723)} no{G3361} sword{G3162}, let him sell{G4453}{(G5657)} his{G846} garment{G2440}, and{G2532} buy{G59}{(G5692)} one."
Luke,22,37,"For{G1063} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, that{G3754} this{G5124} that is written{G1125}{(G5772)} must{G1163}{(G5748)} yet{G2089} be accomplished{G5055}{(G5683)} in{G1722} me{G1698}, And{G2532} he was reckoned{G3049}{(G5681)} among{G3326} the transgressors{G459}: for{G2532}{G1063} the things concerning{G4012} me{G1700} have{G2192}{(G5719)} an end{G5056}."
Luke,22,38,"And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Lord{G2962}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, here{G5602} are two{G1417} swords{G3162}. And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} enough{G2425}."
Luke,22,39,"And{G2532} he came out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and went{G4198}{(G5675)}, as{G2596} he was wont{G1485}, to{G1519} the mount{G3735} of Olives{G1636}; and{G1161} his{G846} disciples{G3101} also{G2532} followed{G190}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
Luke,22,40,"And{G1161} when he was{G1096}{(G5637)} at{G1909} the place{G5117}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Pray{G4336}{(G5737)} that ye enter{G1525}{(G5629)} not{G3361} into{G1519} temptation{G3986}."
Luke,22,41,"And{G2532} he{G846} was withdrawn{G645}{(G5681)} from{G575} them{G846} about{G5616} a stone's{G3037} cast{G1000}, and{G2532} kneeled down{G5087}{(G5631)}{G1119}, and prayed{G4336}{(G5711)},"
Luke,22,42,"Saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Father{G3962}, if{G1487} thou be willing{G1014}{(G5736)}, remove{G3911}{(G5629)}{(G5625)}{G3911}{(G5628)} this{G5124} cup{G4221} from{G575} me{G1700}: nevertheless{G4133} not{G3361} my{G3450} will{G2307}, but{G235} thine{G4674}, be done{G1096}{(G5634)}."
Luke,22,43,"And{G1161} there appeared{G3700}{(G5681)} an angel{G32} unto him{G846} from{G575} heaven{G3772}, strengthening{G1765}{(G5723)} him{G846}."
Luke,22,44,And{G2532} being{G1096}{(G5637)} in{G1722} an agony{G74} he prayed{G4336}{(G5711)} more earnestly{G1617}: and{G1161} his{G846} sweat{G2402} was{G1096}{(G5633)} as it were{G5616} great drops{G2361} of blood{G129} falling down{G2597}{(G5723)} to{G1909} the ground{G1093}.
Luke,22,45,"And{G2532} when he rose up{G450}{(G5631)} from{G575} prayer{G4335}, and was come{G2064}{(G5631)} to{G4314} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, he found{G2147}{(G5627)} them{G846} sleeping{G2837}{(G5746)} for{G575} sorrow{G3077},"
Luke,22,46,"And{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} sleep ye{G2518}{(G5719)}? rise{G450}{(G5631)} and pray{G4336}{(G5737)}, lest{G3363} ye enter{G1525}{(G5632)} into{G1519} temptation{G3986}."
Luke,22,47,"And{G1161} while he{G846} yet{G2089} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)} a multitude{G3793}, and{G2532} he that was called{G3004}{(G5746)} Judas{G2455}, one{G1520} of the twelve{G1427}, went before{G4281}{(G5711)} them{G846}, and{G2532} drew near{G1448}{(G5656)} unto Jesus{G2424} to kiss{G5368}{(G5658)} him{G846}."
Luke,22,48,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Judas{G2455}, betrayest thou{G3860}{(G5719)} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} with a kiss{G5370}?"
Luke,22,49,"When{G1161} they which were about{G4012} him{G846} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} what would follow{G2071}{(G5706)}, they said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962},{G1487} shall we smite{G3960}{(G5692)} with{G1722} the sword{G3162}?"

Luke,22,51,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5679)} and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Suffer ye{G1439}{(G5720)} thus{G5127} far{G2193}. And{G2532} he touched{G680}{(G5671)} his{G846} ear{G5621}, and healed{G2390}{(G5662)} him{G846}."
Luke,22,52,"Then{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} the chief priests{G749}, and{G2532} captains{G4755} of the temple{G2411}, and{G2532} the elders{G4245}, which were come{G3854}{(G5637)} to{G1909} him{G846}, Be ye come out{G1831}{(G5758)}, as{G5613} against{G1909} a thief{G3027}, with{G3326} swords{G3162} and{G2532} staves{G3586}?"
Luke,22,53,"When{G5607} I{G3450} was{G5607}{(G5752)} daily{G2250}{G2596} with{G3326} you{G5216} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}, ye stretched forth{G1614}{(G5656)} no{G3756} hands{G5495} against{G1909} me{G1691}: but{G235} this{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} your{G5216} hour{G5610}, and{G2532} the power{G1849} of darkness{G4655}."
Luke,22,54,"Then{G1161} took they{G4815}{(G5631)} him{G846}, and led{G71}{(G5627)} him, and{G2532} brought{G1521}{(G5627)} him{G846} into{G1519} the high priest's{G749} house{G3624}. And{G1161} Peter{G4074} followed{G190}{(G5707)} afar off{G3113}."
Luke,22,55,"And{G1161} when they{G846} had kindled{G681}{(G5660)} a fire{G4442} in{G1722} the midst{G3319} of the hall{G833}, and{G2532} were set down together{G4776}{(G5660)}, Peter{G4074} sat down{G2521}{(G5711)} among{G3319}{G1722} them{G846}."
Luke,22,56,"But{G1161} a certain{G5100} maid{G3814} beheld{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846} as he sat{G2521}{(G5740)} by{G4314} the fire{G5457}, and{G2532} earnestly looked{G816}{(G5660)} upon him{G846}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)}, This man{G3778} was{G2258}{(G5713)} also{G2532} with{G4862} him{G846}."
Luke,22,57,"And{G1161} he denied{G720}{(G5662)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Woman{G1135}, I know{G1492}{(G5758)} him{G846} not{G3756}."
Luke,22,58,"And{G2532} after{G3326} a little while{G1024} another{G2087} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846}, and said{G5346}{(G5713)}, Thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} also{G2532} of{G1537} them{G846}. And{G1161} Peter{G4074} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Man{G444}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} not{G3756}."
Luke,22,59,"And{G2532} about{G5616} the space{G1339}{(G5631)} of one{G3391} hour{G5610} after another{G243}{G5100} confidently affirmed{G1340}{(G5711)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Of{G1909} a truth{G225} this{G3778} fellow also{G2532} was{G2258}{(G5713)} with{G3326} him{G846}: for{G1063}{G2532} he is{G2076}{(G5748)} a Galilaean{G1057}."
Luke,22,60,"And{G1161} Peter{G4074} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Man{G444}, I know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} what{G3739} thou sayest{G3004}{(G5719)}. And{G2532} immediately{G3916}, while he{G846} yet{G2089} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, the cock{G220} crew{G5455}{(G5656)}."
Luke,22,61,"And{G2532} the Lord{G2962} turned{G4762}{(G5651)}, and looked upon{G1689}{(G5656)} Peter{G4074}.

Luke,22,62,"And{G2532} Peter{G4074} went{G1831}{(G5631)} out{G1854}, and wept{G2799}{(G5656)} bitterly{G4090}."
Luke,22,63,"And{G2532} the men{G435} that held{G4912}{(G5723)} Jesus{G2424} mocked{G1702}{(G5707)} him{G846}, and smote{G1194}{(G5723)} him."
Luke,22,64,"And{G2532} when they had blindfolded{G4028}{(G5660)} him{G846}, they struck{G5180}{(G5707)} him{G846} on the face{G4383}, and{G2532} asked{G1905}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Prophesy{G4395}{(G5657)}, who{G5101} is it{G2076}{(G5748)} that smote{G3817}{(G5660)} thee{G4571}?"
Luke,22,65,And{G2532} many{G4183} other things{G2087} blasphemously{G987}{(G5723)} spake they{G3004}{(G5707)} against{G1519} him{G846}.
Luke,22,66,"And{G2532} as soon as{G5613} it was{G1096}{(G5633)} day{G2250}, the elders{G4244} of the people{G2992} and{G5037} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the scribes{G1122} came together{G4863}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} led{G321}{(G5627)} him{G846} into{G1519} their{G1438} council{G4892}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},"
Luke,22,67,"{G1487} Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} the Christ{G5547}? tell{G2036}{(G5628)} us{G2254}. And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, If{G1437} I tell{G2036}{(G5632)} you{G5213}, ye will{G4100} not{G3364} believe{G4100}{(G5661)}:"
Luke,22,68,"And{G1161} if{G1437} I also{G2532} ask{G2065}{(G5661)} you, ye will{G611} not{G3364} answer{G611}{(G5676)} me{G3427}, nor{G2228} let me go{G630}{(G5661)}."

Luke,23,1,"And{G2532} the whole{G537} multitude{G4128} of them{G846} arose{G450}{(G5631)}, and led{G71}{(G5627)} him{G846} unto{G1909} Pilate{G4091}."
Luke,23,2,"And{G1161} they began{G756}{(G5662)} to accuse{G2723}{(G5721)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, We found{G2147}{(G5627)} this{G5126} fellow perverting{G1294}{(G5723)} the nation{G1484}, and{G2532} forbidding{G2967}{(G5723)} to give{G1325}{(G5721)} tribute{G5411} to Caesar{G2541}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)} that he himself{G1438} is{G1511}{(G5750)} Christ{G5547} a King{G935}."
Luke,23,3,"And{G1161} Pilate{G4091} asked{G1905}{(G5656)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} the King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}? And{G1161} he answered{G611}{(G5679)} him{G846} and said{G5346}{(G5713)}, Thou{G4771} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} it."
Luke,23,4,"Then{G1161} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Pilate{G4091} to{G4314} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} to the people{G3793}, I find{G2147}{(G5719)} no{G3762} fault{G158} in{G1722} this{G5129} man{G444}."
Luke,23,5,"And{G1161} they were the more fierce{G2001}{(G5707)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}{G3754}, He stirreth up{G383}{(G5719)} the people{G2992}, teaching{G1321}{(G5723)} throughout{G2596} all{G3650} Jewry{G2449}, beginning{G756}{(G5671)} from{G575} Galilee{G1056} to{G2193} this place{G5602}."
Luke,23,6,"When{G1161} Pilate{G4091} heard{G191}{(G5660)} of Galilee{G1056}, he asked{G1905}{(G5656)} whether{G1487} the man{G444} were{G2076}{(G5748)} a Galilaean{G1057}."
Luke,23,7,"And{G2532} as soon as he knew{G1921}{(G5631)} that{G3754} he belonged{G2076}{(G5748)} unto{G1537} Herod's{G2264} jurisdiction{G1849}, he sent{G375}{(G5656)} him{G846} to{G4314} Herod{G2264}, who{G5607} himself{G846} also{G2532} was{G5607}{(G5752)} at{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414} at{G1722} that{G5025} time{G2250}."
Luke,23,8,"And{G1161} when Herod{G2264} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} Jesus{G2424}, he was exceeding{G3029} glad{G5463}{(G5644)}: for{G1063} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} desirous{G2309}{(G5723)} to see{G1492}{(G5629)} him{G846} of{G1537} a long{G2425} season, because{G1223} he had heard{G191}{(G5721)} many things{G4183} of{G4012} him{G846}; and{G2532} he hoped{G1679}{(G5707)} to have seen{G1492}{(G5629)} some{G5100} miracle{G4592} done{G1096}{(G5740)} by{G5259} him{G846}."
Luke,23,9,Then{G1161} he questioned{G1905}{(G5707)} with him{G846} in{G1722} many{G2425} words{G3056}; but{G1161} he{G846} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846} nothing{G3762}.
Luke,23,10,And{G1161} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} scribes{G1122} stood{G2476}{(G5715)} and vehemently{G2159} accused{G2723}{(G5723)} him{G846}.
Luke,23,11,"And{G1161} Herod{G2264} with{G4862} his{G846} men of war{G4753} set{G1848} him{G846} at nought{G1848}{(G5660)}, and{G2532} mocked{G1702}{(G5660)} him, and arrayed{G4016}{(G5631)} him{G846} in a gorgeous{G2986} robe{G2066}, and sent{G375} him{G846} again{G375}{(G5656)} to Pilate{G4091}."
Luke,23,12,And{G1161}{G3739} the same{G1722}{G846} day{G2250} Pilate{G4091} and{G2532} Herod{G2264} were made{G1096}{(G5633)} friends{G5384} together{G3326}{G5037}{G240}: for{G1063} before{G4391}{(G5707)} they were{G5607}{(G5752)} at{G1722} enmity{G2189} between{G4314} themselves{G1438}.
Luke,23,13,"And{G1161} Pilate{G4091}, when he had called together{G4779}{(G5671)} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the rulers{G758} and{G2532} the people{G2992},"
Luke,23,14,"Said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, Ye have brought{G4374}{(G5656)} this{G5129} man{G444} unto me{G3427}, as{G5613} one that perverteth{G654}{(G5723)} the people{G2992}: and{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, I{G1473}, having examined{G350}{(G5660)} him before{G1799} you{G5216}, have found{G2147}{(G5627)} no{G3762} fault{G158} in{G1722} this{G5126} man{G444} touching those things{G3739} whereof{G2596} ye accuse{G2723}{(G5719)} him{G846}:"

Luke,23,16,"I will{G3811} therefore{G3767} chastise{G3811}{(G5660)} him{G846}, and release{G630}{(G5692)} him."

Luke,23,18,"And{G1161} they cried out{G349}{(G5656)} all at once{G3826}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Away with{G142}{(G5720)} this{G5126} man, and{G1161} release{G630}{(G5657)} unto us{G2254} Barabbas{G912}:"

Luke,23,23,"And{G1161} they were instant{G1945}{(G5711)} with loud{G3173} voices{G5456}, requiring{G154}{(G5734)} that he{G846} might be crucified{G4717}{(G5683)}. And{G2532} the voices{G5456} of them{G846} and{G2532} of the chief priests{G749} prevailed{G2729}{(G5707)}."
Luke,23,24,And{G1161} Pilate{G4091} gave sentence{G1948}{(G5656)} that it should be as{G1096}{(G5635)} they{G846} required{G155}.
Luke,23,25,"And{G1161} he released{G630}{(G5656)} unto them{G846} him that for{G1223} sedition{G4714} and{G2532} murder{G5408} was cast{G906}{(G5772)} into{G1519} prison{G5438}, whom{G3739} they had desired{G154}{(G5710)}; but{G1161} he delivered{G3860}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} to their{G846} will{G2307}."
Luke,23,26,"And{G2532} as{G5613} they led{G520} him{G846} away{G520}{(G5627)}, they laid hold upon{G1949}{(G5637)} one{G5100} Simon{G4613}, a Cyrenian{G2956}, coming{G2064}{(G5740)} out of{G575} the country{G68}, and on{G2007} him{G846} they laid{G2007}{(G5656)} the cross{G4716}, that he might bear{G5342}{(G5721)} it after{G3693} Jesus{G2424}."
Luke,23,27,"And{G1161} there followed{G190}{(G5707)} him{G846} a great{G4183} company{G4128} of people{G2992}, and{G2532} of women{G1135}, which{G3739} also{G2532} bewailed{G2875}{(G5710)} and{G2532} lamented{G2354}{(G5707)} him{G846}."
Luke,23,28,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} turning{G4762}{(G5651)} unto{G4314} them{G846} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Daughters{G2364} of Jerusalem{G2419}, weep{G2799}{(G5720)} not{G3361} for{G1909} me{G1691}, but{G4133} weep{G2799}{(G5720)} for{G1909} yourselves{G1438}, and{G2532} for{G1909} your{G5216} children{G5043}."
Luke,23,29,"For{G3754}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, the days{G2250} are coming{G2064}{(G5736)}, in{G1722} the which{G3739} they shall say{G2046}{(G5692)}, Blessed{G3107} are the barren{G4723}, and{G2532} the wombs{G2836} that{G3739} never{G3756} bare{G1080}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} the paps{G3149} which{G3739} never{G3756} gave suck{G2337}{(G5656)}."
Luke,23,30,"Then{G5119} shall they begin{G756}{(G5698)} to say{G3004}{(G5721)} to the mountains{G3735}, Fall{G4098}{(G5628)} on{G1909} us{G2248}; and{G2532} to the hills{G1015}, Cover{G2572}{(G5657)} us{G2248}."

Luke,23,32,"And{G1161} there were also{G2532} two{G1417} other{G2087}, malefactors{G2557}, led{G71}{(G5712)} with{G4862} him{G846} to be put to death{G337}{(G5683)}."
Luke,23,33,"And{G2532} when{G3753} they were come{G565}{(G5627)} to{G1909} the place{G5117}, which{G3588} is called{G2564}{(G5746)} Calvary{G2898}, there{G1563} they crucified{G4717}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} the malefactors{G2557}, one{G3739}{G3303} on{G1537} the right hand{G1188}, and{G1161} the other{G3739} on{G1537} the left{G710}."
Luke,23,34,"Then{G1161} said{G3004}{(G5707)} Jesus{G2424}, Father{G3962}, forgive{G863}{(G5628)} them{G846}; for{G1063} they know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} what{G5101} they do{G4160}{(G5719)}. And{G1161} they parted{G1266}{(G5734)} his{G846} raiment{G2440}, and cast{G906}{(G5627)} lots{G2819}."
Luke,23,35,"And{G2532} the people{G2992} stood{G2476}{(G5715)} beholding{G2334}{(G5723)}.

Luke,23,36,"And{G1161} the soldiers{G4757} also{G2532} mocked{G1702}{(G5707)} him{G846}, coming{G4334}{(G5740)} to him, and{G2532} offering{G4374}{(G5723)} him{G846} vinegar{G3690},"

Luke,23,45,"And{G2532} the sun{G2246} was darkened{G4654}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} the veil{G2665} of the temple{G3485} was rent{G4977}{(G5681)} in the midst{G3319}."
Luke,23,46,"And{G2532} when Jesus{G2424} had cried{G5455}{(G5660)} with a loud{G3173} voice{G5456}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Father{G3962}, into{G1519} thy{G4675} hands{G5495} I commend{G3908}{(G5695)} my{G3450} spirit{G4151}: and{G2532} having said{G2036}{(G5631)} thus{G5023}, he gave up the ghost{G1606}{(G5656)}."
Luke,23,47,"Now{G1161} when the centurion{G1543} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} what was done{G1096}{(G5637)}, he glorified{G1392}{(G5656)} God{G2316}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Certainly{G3689} this{G3778} was{G2258}{(G5713)} a righteous{G1342} man{G444}."

Luke,23,52,"This{G3778} man went{G4334}{(G5631)} unto Pilate{G4091}, and begged{G154}{(G5668)} the body{G4983} of Jesus{G2424}."
Luke,23,53,"And{G2532} he took{G2507} it{G846} down{G2507}{(G5631)}, and wrapped{G1794}{(G5656)} it{G846} in linen{G4616}, and{G2532} laid{G5087}{(G5656)} it{G846} in{G1722} a sepulchre{G3418} that was hewn in stone{G2991}, wherein{G3757} never{G3756} man{G3764} before{G3762} was{G2258}{(G5713)} laid{G2749}{(G5740)}."
Luke,23,54,"And{G2532} that day{G2250} was{G2258}{(G5713)} the preparation{G3904}, and{G2532} the sabbath{G4521} drew on{G2020}{(G5707)}."
Luke,23,55,"And{G1161} the women{G1135} also{G2532}, which{G3748} came{G2258}{(G5713)}{G4905}{(G5761)} with him{G846} from{G1537} Galilee{G1056}, followed after{G2628}{(G5660)}, and beheld{G2300}{(G5662)} the sepulchre{G3419}, and{G2532} how{G5613} his{G846} body{G4983} was laid{G5087}{(G5681)}."
Luke,23,56,"And they returned{G5290}{(G5660)}, and{G1161} prepared{G2090}{(G5656)} spices{G759} and{G2532} ointments{G3464}; and{G2532} rested{G2270}{(G5656)}{G3303} the sabbath day{G4521} according{G2596} to the commandment{G1785}."
Luke,24,1,"Now{G1161} upon the first{G3391} day of the week{G4521}, very early in the morning{G3722}{G901}, they came{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G1909} the sepulchre{G3418}, bringing{G5342}{(G5723)} the spices{G759} which{G3739} they had prepared{G2090}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} certain{G5100} others with{G4862} them{G846}."
Luke,24,2,And{G1161} they found{G2147}{(G5627)} the stone{G3037} rolled away{G617}{(G5772)} from{G575} the sepulchre{G3419}.
Luke,24,3,"And{G2532} they entered in{G1525}{(G5631)}, and found{G2147}{(G5627)} not{G3756} the body{G4983} of the Lord{G2962} Jesus{G2424}."

Luke,24,11,"And{G2532} their{G846} words{G4487} seemed{G5316}{(G5648)} to{G1799} them{G846} as{G5616} idle tales{G3026}, and{G2532} they believed{G569} them{G846} not{G569}{(G5707)}."
Luke,24,12,"Then{G1161} arose{G450}{(G5631)} Peter{G4074}, and ran{G5143}{(G5627)} unto{G1909} the sepulchre{G3419}; and{G2532} stooping down{G3879}{(G5660)}, he beheld{G991}{(G5719)} the linen clothes{G3608} laid{G2749}{(G5740)} by themselves{G3441}, and{G2532} departed{G565}{(G5627)}, wondering{G2296}{(G5723)} in{G4314} himself{G1438} at that which was come to pass{G1096}{(G5756)}."
Luke,24,13,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, two{G1417} of{G1537} them{G846} went{G2258}{(G5713)}{G4198}{(G5740)} that{G1722} same{G846} day{G2250} to{G1519} a village{G2968} called{G3739}{G3686} Emmaus{G1695}, which was{G568}{(G5723)} from{G575} Jerusalem{G2419} about threescore{G1835} furlongs{G4712}."
Luke,24,14,And{G2532} they{G846} talked{G3656}{(G5707)} together{G4314}{G240} of{G4012} all{G3956} these things{G5130} which had happened{G4819}{(G5761)}.

Luke,24,22,"Yea{G235}, and certain{G5100} women{G1135} also{G2532} of{G1537} our company{G2257} made{G1839} us{G2248} astonished{G1839}{(G5627)}, which were{G1096}{(G5637)} early{G3721} at{G1909} the sepulchre{G3419};"
Luke,24,23,"And{G2532} when they found{G2147}{(G5631)} not{G3361} his{G846} body{G4983}, they came{G2064}{(G5627)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, that they had{G3708} also{G2532} seen{G3708}{(G5760)} a vision{G3701} of angels{G32}, which{G3739} said{G3004}{(G5719)} that he{G846} was alive{G2198}{(G5721)}."
Luke,24,24,"And{G2532} certain of them{G5100} which were with{G4862} us{G2254} went{G565}{(G5627)} to{G1909} the sepulchre{G3419}, and{G2532} found{G2147}{(G5627)} it even{G2532} so{G3779} as{G2531} the women{G1135} had said{G2036}{(G5627)}: but{G1161} him{G846} they saw{G1492}{(G5627)} not{G3756}."
Luke,24,25,"Then{G2532} he{G846} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, O{G5599} fools{G453}, and{G2532} slow{G1021} of heart{G2588} to believe{G4100}{(G5721)}{G1909} all{G3956} that{G3739} the prophets{G4396} have spoken{G2980}{(G5656)}:"

Luke,24,27,"And{G2532} beginning{G756}{(G5671)} at{G575} Moses{G3475} and{G2532}{G575} all{G3956} the prophets{G4396}, he expounded{G1329}{(G5707)} unto them{G846} in{G1722} all{G3956} the scriptures{G1124} the things concerning{G4012} himself{G1438}."
Luke,24,28,"And{G2532} they drew nigh{G1448}{(G5656)} unto{G1519} the village{G2968}, whither{G3757} they went{G4198}{(G5711)}: and{G2532} he{G846} made as though{G4364}{(G5710)} he would have gone{G4198}{(G5738)} further{G4208}."
Luke,24,29,"But{G2532} they constrained{G3849}{(G5662)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Abide{G3306}{(G5657)} with{G3326} us{G2257}: for{G3754} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} toward{G4314} evening{G2073}, and{G2532} the day{G2250} is far spent{G2827}{(G5758)}. And{G2532} he went in{G1525}{(G5627)} to tarry{G3306}{(G5658)} with{G4862} them{G846}."
Luke,24,30,"And{G2532} it came to pass{G1096}{(G5633)}, as{G1722} he{G846} sat at meat{G2625}{(G5683)} with{G3326} them{G846}, he took{G2983}{(G5631)} bread{G740}, and blessed{G2127}{(G5656)} it, and{G2532} brake{G2806}{(G5660)}, and gave{G1929}{(G5707)} to them{G846}."
Luke,24,31,"And{G1161} their{G846} eyes{G3788} were opened{G1272}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} they knew{G1921}{(G5627)} him{G846}; and{G2532} he{G846} vanished{G1096}{(G5633)}{G855} out of{G575} their sight{G846}."
Luke,24,32,"And{G2532} they said{G2036}{(G5627)} one to another{G4314}{G240}, Did{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G3780} our{G2257} heart{G2588} burn{G2545}{(G5746)} within{G1722} us{G2254}, while{G5613} he talked{G2980}{(G5707)} with us{G2254} by{G1722} the way{G3598}, and{G2532} while{G5613} he opened{G1272}{(G5707)} to us{G2254} the scriptures{G1124}?"
Luke,24,33,"And{G2532} they rose up{G450}{(G5631)} the same{G846} hour{G5610}, and returned{G5290}{(G5656)} to{G1519} Jerusalem{G2419}, and{G2532} found{G2147}{(G5627)} the eleven{G1733} gathered together{G4867}{(G5772)}, and{G2532} them that were with{G4862} them{G846},"

Luke,24,35,"And{G2532} they{G846} told{G1834}{(G5711)} what things were done in{G1722} the way{G3598}, and{G2532} how{G5613} he was known{G1097}{(G5681)} of them{G846} in{G1722} breaking{G2800} of bread{G740}."
Luke,24,36,"And{G1161} as they{G846} thus{G5023} spake{G2980}{(G5723)}, Jesus{G2424} himself{G846} stood{G2476}{(G5627)} in{G1722} the midst{G3319} of them{G846}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Peace{G1515} be unto you{G5213}."
Luke,24,37,"But{G1161} they were terrified{G4422}{(G5685)} and{G2532} affrighted{G1719}{G1096}{(G5637)}, and supposed{G1380}{(G5707)} that they had seen{G2334}{(G5721)} a spirit{G4151}."
Luke,24,38,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G5101} are ye{G2075}{(G5748)} troubled{G5015}{(G5772)}? and{G2532} why{G1302} do thoughts{G1261} arise{G305}{(G5719)} in{G1722} your{G5216} hearts{G2588}?"

Luke,24,40,"And{G2532} when he had thus{G5124} spoken{G2036}{(G5631)}, he shewed{G1925}{(G5656)} them{G846} his hands{G5495} and{G2532} his feet{G4228}."
Luke,24,41,"And{G1161} while they{G846} yet{G2089} believed not{G569}{(G5723)} for{G575} joy{G5479}, and{G2532} wondered{G2296}{(G5723)}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Have ye{G2192}{(G5719)} here{G1759} any{G5100} meat{G1034}?"
Luke,24,42,"And{G1161} they gave{G1929}{(G5656)} him{G846} a piece{G3313} of a broiled{G3702} fish{G2486}, and{G2532} of{G575} an honeycomb{G3193}{G2781}."
Luke,24,43,"And{G2532} he took{G2983}{(G5631)} it, and did eat{G5315}{(G5627)} before{G1799} them{G846}."
Luke,24,44,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, These{G3778} are the words{G3056} which{G3739} I spake{G2980}{(G5656)} unto{G4314} you{G5209}, while{G5607}{(G5752)} I was yet{G2089} with{G4862} you{G5213}, that{G3754} all things{G3956} must{G1163}{(G5748)} be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5683)}, which{G3588} were written{G1125}{(G5772)} in{G1722} the law{G3551} of Moses{G3475}, and{G2532} in the prophets{G4396}, and{G2532} in the psalms{G5568}, concerning{G4012} me{G1700}."

Luke,24,48,And{G1161} ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} witnesses{G3144} of these things{G5130}.
Luke,24,49,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, I{G1473} send{G649}{(G5719)} the promise{G1860} of my{G3450} Father{G3962} upon{G1909} you{G5209}: but{G1161} tarry{G2523}{(G5657)} ye{G5210} in{G1722} the city{G4172} of Jerusalem{G2419}, until{G2193} ye{G3739} be endued{G1746}{(G5672)} with power{G1411} from{G1537} on high{G5311}."

John,1,2,The same{G3778} was{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} the beginning{G746} with{G4314} God{G2316}.
John,1,3,All things{G3956} were made{G1096}{(G5633)} by{G1223} him{G846}; and{G2532} without{G5565} him{G846} was{G1096} not{G3761} any thing{G1520} made{G1096}{(G5633)} that{G3739} was made{G1096}{(G5754)}.

John,4,11,"The woman{G1135} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, thou hast{G2192}{(G5719)} nothing{G3777} to draw with{G502}, and{G2532} the well{G5421} is{G2076}{(G5748)} deep{G901}: from whence{G4159} then{G3767} hast thou{G2192}{(G5719)} that living{G2198}{(G5723)} water{G5204}?"
John,4,12,"{G3361} Art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} greater{G3187} than our{G2257} father{G3962} Jacob{G2384}, which{G3739} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} us{G2254} the well{G5421}, and{G2532} drank{G4095}{(G5627)} thereof{G1537}{G846} himself{G846}, and{G2532} his{G846} children{G5207}, and{G2532} his{G846} cattle{G2353}?"
John,4,13,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, Whosoever{G3956} drinketh{G4095}{(G5723)} of{G1537} this{G5127} water{G5204} shall thirst{G1372}{(G5692)} again{G3825}:"
John,4,14,But{G1161} whosoever{G3739}{G302} drinketh{G4095}{(G5632)} of{G1537} the water{G5204} that{G3739} I{G1473} shall give{G1325}{(G5692)} him{G846} shall{G1372} never{G1519}{G165}{G3364} thirst{G1372}{(G5661)}; but{G235} the water{G5204} that{G3739} I shall give{G1325}{(G5692)} him{G846} shall be{G1096}{(G5695)} in{G1722} him{G846} a well{G4077} of water{G5204} springing up{G242}{(G5740)} into{G1519} everlasting{G166} life{G2222}.
John,4,15,"The woman{G1135} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, give{G1325}{(G5628)} me{G3427} this{G5124} water{G5204}, that{G3363} I thirst{G1372}{(G5725)} not{G3363}, neither{G3366} come{G2064}{(G5741)} hither{G1759} to draw{G501}{(G5721)}."
John,4,16,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Go{G5217}{(G5720)}, call{G5455}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} husband{G435}, and{G2532} come{G2064}{(G5628)} hither{G1759}."
John,4,17,"The woman{G1135} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} husband{G435}. Jesus{G2424} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Thou hast{G2036} well{G2573} said{G2036}{(G5627)},{G3754} I have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} husband{G435}:"
John,4,18,For{G1063} thou hast had{G2192}{(G5627)} five{G4002} husbands{G435}; and{G2532} he whom{G3739} thou{G2192} now{G3568} hast{G2192}{(G5719)} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} thy{G4675} husband{G435}: in that{G5124} saidst thou{G2046}{(G5758)} truly{G227}.
John,4,19,"The woman{G1135} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, I perceive{G2334}{(G5719)} that{G3754} thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} a prophet{G4396}."
John,4,20,"Our{G2257} fathers{G3962} worshipped{G4352}{(G5656)} in{G1722} this{G5129} mountain{G3735}; and{G2532} ye{G5210} say{G3004}{(G5719)}, that{G3754} in{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the place{G5117} where{G3699} men ought{G1163}{(G5748)} to worship{G4352}{(G5721)}."
John,4,21,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Woman{G1135}, believe{G4100}{(G5657)} me{G3427}, the hour{G5610} cometh{G3754}{G2064}{(G5736)}, when{G3753} ye shall{G4352} neither{G3777} in{G1722} this{G5129} mountain{G3735}, nor yet{G3777} at{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414}, worship{G4352}{(G5692)} the Father{G3962}."
John,4,22,Ye{G5210} worship{G4352}{(G5719)} ye know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} what{G3739}: we know{G1492}{(G5758)} what{G3739} we{G2249} worship{G4352}{(G5719)}: for{G3754} salvation{G4991} is{G2076}{(G5748)} of{G1537} the Jews{G2453}.
John,4,23,"But{G235} the hour{G5610} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} now{G3568} is{G2076}{(G5748)}, when{G3753} the true{G228} worshippers{G4353} shall worship{G4352}{(G5692)} the Father{G3962} in{G1722} spirit{G4151} and{G2532} in truth{G225}: for{G2532}{G1063} the Father{G3962} seeketh{G2212}{(G5719)} such{G5108} to worship{G4352}{(G5723)} him{G846}."
John,4,24,God{G2316} is a Spirit{G4151}: and{G2532} they that worship{G4352}{(G5723)} him{G846} must{G1163}{(G5748)} worship{G4352}{(G5721)} him in{G1722} spirit{G4151} and{G2532} in truth{G225}.
John,4,25,"The woman{G1135} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, I know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} Messias{G3323} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, which{G3588} is called{G3004}{(G5746)} Christ{G5547}: when{G3752} he{G1565} is come{G2064}{(G5632)}, he will tell{G312}{(G5692)} us{G2254} all things{G3956}."
John,4,26,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, I{G1473} that speak{G2980}{(G5723)} unto thee{G4671} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he."
John,4,27,"And{G2532} upon{G1909} this{G5129} came{G2064}{(G5627)} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} marvelled{G2296}{(G5656)} that{G3754} he talked{G2980}{(G5707)} with{G3326} the woman{G1135}: yet{G3305} no man{G3762} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, What{G5101} seekest thou{G2212}{(G5719)}? or{G2228}, Why{G5101} talkest thou{G2980}{(G5719)} with{G3326} her{G846}?"
John,4,28,"The woman{G1135} then{G3767} left{G863}{(G5656)} her{G846} waterpot{G5201}, and{G2532} went her way{G565}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the city{G4172}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} to the men{G444},"
John,4,29,"Come{G1205}{(G5773)}, see{G1492}{(G5628)} a man{G444}, which{G3739} told{G2036}{(G5627)} me{G3427} all things{G3956} that ever{G3745} I did{G4160}{(G5656)}: is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3385} this{G3778} the Christ{G5547}?"
John,4,30,"Then{G3767} they went{G1831}{(G5627)} out of{G1537} the city{G4172}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5711)} unto{G4314} him{G846}."
John,4,31,"{G1161} In{G1722} the mean{G3342} while his disciples{G3101} prayed{G2065}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Master{G4461}, eat{G5315}{(G5628)}."
John,4,32,"But{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, I{G1473} have{G2192}{(G5719)} meat{G1035} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)} that{G3739} ye{G5210} know{G1492} not{G3756} of{G1492}{(G5758)}."
John,4,33,"Therefore{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} the disciples{G3101} one to another{G4314}{G240}, Hath{G5342} any man{G3387} brought{G5342}{(G5656)} him{G846} ought to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}?"

John,4,38,"I{G1473} sent{G649}{(G5656)} you{G5209} to reap{G2325}{(G5721)} that whereon{G3739} ye{G5210} bestowed{G2872} no{G3756} labour{G2872}{(G5758)}: other men{G243} laboured{G2872}{(G5758)}, and{G2532} ye{G5210} are entered{G1525}{(G5754)} into{G1519} their{G846} labours{G2873}."
John,4,39,"And{G1161} many{G4183} of the Samaritans{G4541} of{G1537} that{G1565} city{G4172} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846} for{G1223} the saying{G3056} of the woman{G1135}, which testified{G3140}{(G5723)},{G3754} He told{G2036}{(G5627)} me{G3427} all{G3956} that ever{G3745} I did{G4160}{(G5656)}."
John,4,40,"So{G3767} when{G5613} the Samaritans{G4541} were come{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, they besought{G2065}{(G5707)} him{G846} that he would tarry{G3306}{(G5658)} with{G3844} them{G846}: and{G2532} he abode{G3306}{(G5656)} there{G1563} two{G1417} days{G2250}."
John,4,41,And{G2532} many{G4183} more{G4119} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} because{G1223} of his own{G846} word{G3056};
John,4,42,"And{G5037} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto the woman{G1135},{G3754} Now{G3765} we believe{G4100}{(G5719)}, not{G3754} because{G1223} of thy{G4674} saying{G2981}: for{G1063} we have heard{G191}{(G5754)} him ourselves{G846}, and{G2532} know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} this{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} indeed{G230} the Christ{G5547}, the Saviour{G4990} of the world{G2889}."
John,4,43,"Now{G1161} after{G3326} two{G1417} days{G2250} he departed{G565}{(G5627)}{G1831}{(G5627)} thence{G1564}, and{G2532} went into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}."
John,4,44,"For{G1063} Jesus{G2424} himself{G846} testified{G3140}{(G5656)}, that{G3754} a prophet{G4396} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} honour{G5092} in{G1722} his own{G2398} country{G3968}."
John,4,45,"Then{G3767} when{G3753} he was come{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}, the Galilaeans{G1057} received{G1209}{(G5662)} him{G846}, having seen{G3708}{(G5761)} all the things{G3956} that{G3739} he did{G4160}{(G5656)} at{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414} at{G1722} the feast{G1859}: for{G1063} they{G846} also{G2532} went{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G1519} the feast{G1859}."
John,4,46,"So{G3767} Jesus{G2424} came{G2064}{(G5627)} again{G3825} into{G1519} Cana{G2580} of Galilee{G1056}, where{G3699} he made{G4160}{(G5656)} the water{G5204} wine{G3631}. And{G2532} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a certain{G5100} nobleman{G937}, whose{G3739} son{G5207} was sick{G770}{(G5707)} at{G1722} Capernaum{G2584}."
John,4,47,"When he{G3778} heard{G191}{(G5660)} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} was come{G2240}{(G5719)} out of{G1537} Judaea{G2449} into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}, he went{G565}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, and{G2532} besought{G2065}{(G5707)} him{G846} that{G2443} he would come down{G2597}{(G5632)}, and{G2532} heal{G2390}{(G5667)} his{G846} son{G5207}: for{G1063} he was at the point{G3195}{(G5707)} of death{G599}{(G5721)}."
John,4,48,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Except{G3362} ye see{G1492}{(G5632)} signs{G4592} and{G2532} wonders{G5059}, ye will{G4100} not{G3364} believe{G4100}{(G5661)}."
John,4,49,"The nobleman{G937} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, come down{G2597}{(G5628)} ere{G4250} my{G3450} child{G3813} die{G599}{(G5629)}."
John,4,50,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Go thy way{G4198}{(G5737)}; thy{G4675} son{G5207} liveth{G2198}{(G5719)}. And{G2532} the man{G444} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} the word{G3056} that{G3739} Jesus{G2424} had spoken{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, and{G2532} he went his way{G4198}{(G5711)}."
John,4,51,"And{G1161} as he{G846} was now{G2235} going down{G2597}{(G5723)}, his{G846} servants{G1401} met{G528}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} told{G518}{(G5656)} him, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} Thy{G4675} son{G3816} liveth{G2198}{(G5719)}."
John,4,52,"Then{G3767} enquired he{G4441}{(G5633)} of{G3844} them{G846} the hour{G5610} when{G1722}{G3739} he began{G2192}{(G5627)} to amend{G2866}. And{G2532} they said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846},{G3754} Yesterday{G5504} at the seventh{G1442} hour{G5610} the fever{G4446} left{G863}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
John,4,53,"So{G3767} the father{G3962} knew{G1097}{(G5627)} that{G3754} it was at{G1722} the same{G1565} hour{G5610}, in{G1722} the which{G3739} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846},{G3754} Thy{G4675} son{G5207} liveth{G2198}{(G5719)}: and{G2532} himself{G846} believed{G4100}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} his{G846} whole{G3650} house{G3614}."
John,4,54,"This{G5124} is again{G3825} the second{G1208} miracle{G4592} that Jesus{G2424} did{G4160}{(G5656)}, when he was come out{G2064}{(G5631)} of{G1537} Judaea{G2449} into{G1519} Galilee{G1056}."
John,5,1,After{G3326} this{G5023} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a feast{G1859} of the Jews{G2453}; and{G2532} Jesus{G2424} went up{G305}{(G5627)} to{G1519} Jerusalem{G2414}.
John,5,2,"Now{G1161} there is{G2076}{(G5748)} at{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414} by{G1909} the sheep{G4262} market a pool{G2861}, which{G3588} is called{G1951}{(G5746)} in the Hebrew tongue{G1447} Bethesda{G964}, having{G2192}{(G5723)} five{G4002} porches{G4745}."
John,5,3,"In{G1722} these{G5025} lay{G2621}{(G5711)} a great{G4183} multitude{G4128} of impotent folk{G770}{(G5723)}, of blind{G5185}, halt{G5560}, withered{G3584}, waiting for{G1551}{(G5740)} the moving{G2796} of the water{G5204}."
John,5,4,"For{G1063} an angel{G32} went down{G2597}{(G5707)} at{G2596} a certain season{G2540} into{G1722} the pool{G2861}, and{G2532} troubled{G5015}{(G5707)} the water{G5204}: whosoever then{G3767} first{G4413} after{G3326} the troubling{G5016} of the water{G5204} stepped in{G1684}{(G5631)} was made{G1096}{(G5711)} whole{G5199} of{G3739} whatsoever{G1221} disease{G3553} he had{G2722}{(G5712)}."
John,5,5,"And{G1161} a certain{G5100} man{G444} was{G2258}{(G5713)} there{G1563}, which had{G2192}{(G5723)} an infirmity{G1722}{G769} thirty{G5144} and eight{G3638} years{G2094}."
John,5,6,"When Jesus{G2424} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G5126} lie{G2621}{(G5740)}, and{G2532} knew{G1097}{(G5631)} that{G3754} he had been{G2192}{(G5719)} now{G2235} a long{G4183} time{G5550} in that case, he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Wilt thou{G2309}{(G5719)} be made{G1096}{(G5635)} whole{G5199}?"
John,5,7,"The impotent man{G770}{(G5723)} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, I have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} man{G444}, when{G3752} the water{G5204} is troubled{G5015}{(G5686)}, to{G2443} put{G906}{(G5725)} me{G3165} into{G1519} the pool{G2861}: but{G1161} while{G1722}{G3739} I{G1473} am coming{G2064}{(G5736)}, another{G243} steppeth down{G2597}{(G5719)} before{G4253} me{G1700}."
John,5,8,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Rise{G1453}{(G5669)}, take up{G142}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} bed{G2895}, and{G2532} walk{G4043}{(G5720)}."
John,5,9,"And{G2532} immediately{G2112} the man{G444} was made{G1096}{(G5633)} whole{G5199}, and{G2532} took up{G142}{(G5656)} his{G846} bed{G2895}, and{G2532} walked{G4043}{(G5707)}: and{G1161} on{G1722} the same{G1565} day{G2250} was{G2258}{(G5713)} the sabbath{G4521}."
John,5,10,"The Jews{G2453} therefore{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him that was cured{G2323}{(G5772)}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} the sabbath day{G4521}: it is{G1832} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} for thee{G4671} to carry{G142}{(G5658)} thy bed{G2895}."
John,5,11,"He answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, He that made{G4160}{(G5660)} me{G3165} whole{G5199}, the same{G1565} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto me{G3427}, Take up{G142}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} bed{G2895}, and{G2532} walk{G4043}{(G5720)}."
John,5,12,"Then{G3767} asked they{G2065}{(G5656)} him{G846}, What{G5101} man{G444} is{G2076}{(G5748)} that which{G3588} said{G2036}{(G5631)} unto thee{G4671}, Take up{G142}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} bed{G2895}, and{G2532} walk{G4043}{(G5720)}?"
John,5,13,"And{G1161} he that was healed{G2390}{(G5685)} wist{G1492}{(G5715)} not{G3756} who{G5101} it was{G2076}{(G5748)}: for{G1063} Jesus{G2424} had conveyed himself away{G1593}{(G5656)}, a multitude{G3793} being{G5607}{(G5752)} in{G1722} that place{G5117}."
John,5,14,"Afterward{G3326}{G5023} Jesus{G2424} findeth{G2147}{(G5719)} him{G846} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Behold{G2396}, thou art made{G1096}{(G5754)} whole{G5199}: sin{G264}{(G5720)} no more{G3371}, lest{G3363} a worse thing{G5501}{G5100} come{G1096}{(G5638)} unto thee{G4671}."
John,5,15,"The man{G444} departed{G565}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} told{G312}{(G5656)} the Jews{G2453} that{G3754} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} Jesus{G2424}, which{G3588} had made{G4160}{(G5660)} him{G846} whole{G5199}."
John,5,16,"And{G2532} therefore{G1223}{G5124} did{G1377} the Jews{G2453} persecute{G1377}{(G5707)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} to slay{G615}{(G5658)} him{G846}, because{G3754} he had done{G4160}{(G5707)} these things{G5023} on{G1722} the sabbath day{G4521}."
John,5,17,"But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, My{G3450} Father{G3962} worketh{G2038}{(G5736)} hitherto{G2193}{G737}, and I{G2504} work{G2038}{(G5736)}."
John,5,18,"Therefore{G1223}{G5124}{G3767} the Jews{G2453} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} the more{G3123} to kill{G615}{(G5658)} him{G846}, because{G3754} he{G3089} not{G3756} only{G3440} had broken{G3089}{(G5707)} the sabbath{G4521}, but{G235} said{G3004}{(G5707)} also{G2532} that God{G2316} was his{G2398} Father{G3962}, making{G4160}{(G5723)} himself{G1438} equal{G2470} with God{G2316}."
John,5,19,"Then{G3767} answered{G611}{(G5662)} Jesus{G2424} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, The Son{G5207} can{G1410}{(G5736)}{G3756} do{G4160}{(G5721)} nothing{G3762} of{G575} himself{G1438}, but{G3362} what{G5100} he seeth{G991}{(G5725)} the Father{G3962} do{G4160}{(G5723)}: for{G1063} what things soever{G3739}{G302} he{G1565} doeth{G4160}{(G5725)}, these{G5023} also{G2532} doeth{G4160}{(G5719)} the Son{G5207} likewise{G3668}."
John,5,20,"For{G1063} the Father{G3962} loveth{G5368}{(G5719)} the Son{G5207}, and{G2532} sheweth{G1166}{(G5719)} him{G846} all things{G3956} that{G3739} himself{G846} doeth{G4160}{(G5719)}: and{G2532} he will shew{G1166}{(G5692)} him{G846} greater{G3187} works{G2041} than{G3187} these{G5130}, that{G2443} ye{G5210} may marvel{G2296}{(G5725)}."
John,5,21,"For{G1063} as{G5618} the Father{G3962} raiseth up{G1453}{(G5719)} the dead{G3498}, and{G2532} quickeneth{G2227}{(G5719)} them; even{G2532} so{G3779} the Son{G5207} quickeneth{G2227}{(G5719)} whom{G3739} he will{G2309}{(G5719)}."
John,5,22,"For{G1063}{G3761} the Father{G3962} judgeth{G2919}{(G5719)} no man{G3762}, but{G235} hath committed{G1325}{(G5758)} all{G3956} judgment{G2920} unto the Son{G5207}:"
John,5,23,"That{G2443} all{G3956} men should honour{G5091}{(G5725)} the Son{G5207}, even as{G2531} they honour{G5091}{(G5719)} the Father{G3962}.

John,5,24,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} He that heareth{G191}{(G5723)} my{G3450} word{G3056}, and{G2532} believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} on him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}, hath{G2192}{(G5719)} everlasting{G166} life{G2222}, and{G2532} shall{G2064} not{G3756} come{G2064}{(G5736)} into{G1519} condemnation{G2920}; but{G235} is passed{G3327}{(G5758)} from{G1537} death{G2288} unto{G1519} life{G2222}."
John,5,25,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} The hour{G5610} is coming{G2064}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} now{G3568} is{G2076}{(G5748)}, when{G3753} the dead{G3498} shall hear{G191}{(G5695)} the voice{G5456} of the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}: and{G2532} they that hear{G191}{(G5660)} shall live{G2198}{(G5695)}."
John,5,26,For{G1063} as{G5618} the Father{G3962} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} life{G2222} in{G1722} himself{G1438}; so{G2532}{G3779} hath he given{G1325}{(G5656)} to the Son{G5207} to have{G2192}{(G5721)} life{G2222} in{G1722} himself{G1438};

John,6,6,And{G1161} this{G5124} he said{G3004}{(G5707)} to prove{G3985}{(G5723)} him{G846}: for{G1063} he himself{G846} knew{G1492}{(G5715)} what{G5101} he would{G3195}{(G5707)} do{G4160}{(G5721)}.
John,6,7,"Philip{G5376} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, Two hundred{G1250} pennyworth{G1220} of bread{G740} is{G714} not{G3756} sufficient{G714}{(G5719)} for them{G846}, that{G2443} every one{G1538} of them{G846} may take{G2983}{(G5632)} a{G5100} little{G1024}."
John,6,8,"One{G1520} of{G1537} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Andrew{G406}, Simon{G4613} Peter's{G4074} brother{G80}, saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846},"
John,6,9,"There is{G2076}{(G5748)} a{G1520} lad{G3808} here{G5602}, which{G3739} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} five{G4002} barley{G2916} loaves{G740}, and{G2532} two{G1417} small fishes{G3795}: but{G235} what{G5101} are{G2076}{(G5748)} they{G5023} among{G1519} so many{G5118}?"
John,6,10,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Make{G4160}{(G5657)} the men{G444} sit down{G377}{(G5629)}. Now{G1161} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} much{G4183} grass{G5528} in{G1722} the place{G5117}. So{G3767} the men{G435} sat down{G377}{(G5627)}, in number{G706} about{G5616} five thousand{G4000}."
John,6,11,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} took{G2983}{(G5627)} the loaves{G740}; and{G2532} when he had given thanks{G2168}{(G5660)}, he distributed{G1239}{(G5656)} to the disciples{G3101}, and{G1161} the disciples{G3101} to them that were set down{G345}{(G5740)}; and{G2532} likewise{G3668} of{G1537} the fishes{G3795} as much as{G3745} they would{G2309}{(G5707)}."
John,6,12,"When{G1161}{G5613} they were filled{G1705}{(G5681)}, he said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Gather up{G4863}{(G5628)} the fragments{G2801} that remain{G4052}{(G5660)}, that nothing{G3363}{G5100} be lost{G622}{(G5643)}."
John,6,13,"Therefore{G3767} they gathered them together{G4863}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} filled{G1072}{(G5656)} twelve{G1427} baskets{G2894} with the fragments{G2801} of{G1537} the five{G4002} barley{G2916} loaves{G740}, which{G3739} remained over and above{G4052}{(G5656)} unto them that had eaten{G977}{(G5761)}."
John,6,14,"Then{G3767} those men{G444}, when they had seen{G1492}{(G5631)} the miracle{G4592} that{G3739} Jesus{G2424} did{G4160}{(G5656)}, said{G3004}{(G5707)}, This{G3754}{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} of a truth{G230} that prophet{G4396} that should come{G2064}{(G5740)} into{G1519} the world{G2889}."
John,6,15,"When Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} perceived{G1097}{(G5631)} that{G3754} they would{G3195}{(G5719)} come{G2064}{(G5738)} and{G2532} take{G726} him{G846} by force{G726}{(G5721)}, to{G2443} make{G4160}{(G5661)} him{G846} a king{G935}, he departed{G402}{(G5656)} again{G3825} into{G1519} a mountain{G3735} himself{G846} alone{G3441}."
John,6,16,"And{G1161} when{G5613} even{G3798} was now come{G1096}{(G5633)}, his{G846} disciples{G3101} went down{G2597}{(G5627)} unto{G1909} the sea{G2281},"
John,6,17,"And{G2532} entered{G1684}{(G5631)} into{G1519} a ship{G4143}, and went{G2064}{(G5711)} over{G4008} the sea{G2281} toward{G1519} Capernaum{G2584}. And{G2532} it was{G1096}{(G5715)} now{G2235} dark{G4653}, and{G2532} Jesus{G2424} was{G2064} not{G3756} come{G2064}{(G5715)} to{G4314} them{G846}."
John,6,18,And{G5037} the sea{G2281} arose{G1326}{(G5712)} by reason of a great{G3173} wind{G417} that blew{G4154}{(G5723)}.
John,6,19,"So{G3767} when they had rowed{G1643}{(G5761)} about{G5613} five{G4002} and twenty{G1501} or{G2228} thirty{G5144} furlongs{G4712}, they see{G2334}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424} walking{G4043}{(G5723)} on{G1909} the sea{G2281}, and{G2532} drawing{G1096}{(G5740)} nigh{G1451} unto the ship{G4143}: and{G2532} they were afraid{G5399}{(G5675)}."
John,6,20,"But{G1161} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, It is{G1510}{(G5748)} I{G1473}; be{G5399} not{G3361} afraid{G5399}{(G5737)}."
John,6,21,Then{G3767} they willingly{G2309}{(G5707)} received{G2983}{(G5629)} him{G846} into{G1519} the ship{G4143}: and{G2532} immediately{G2112} the ship{G4143} was{G1096}{(G5633)} at{G1909} the land{G1093} whither{G1519}{G3739} they went{G5217}{(G5707)}.
John,6,22,"The day following{G1887}, when the people{G3793} which{G3588} stood{G2476}{(G5761)} on the other side{G4008} of the sea{G2281} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} that{G3754} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} none{G3756} other{G243} boat{G4142} there{G1563}, save{G1508} that{G1565} one{G1520} whereinto{G1519}{G3739} his{G846} disciples{G3101} were entered{G1684}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} went{G4897} not{G3756} with{G4897}{(G5627)} his{G846} disciples{G3101} into{G1519} the boat{G4142}, but{G235} that his{G846} disciples{G3101} were gone away{G565}{(G5627)} alone{G3441};"
John,6,23,"(Howbeit{G235}{G1161} there came{G2064}{(G5627)} other{G243} boats{G4142} from{G1537} Tiberias{G5085} nigh{G1451} unto the place{G5117} where{G3699} they did eat{G5315}{(G5627)} bread{G740}, after that the Lord{G2962} had given thanks{G2168}{(G5660)}:)"
John,6,24,"When{G3753} the people{G3793} therefore{G3767} saw{G1492}{(G5627)} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} was{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} there{G1563}, neither{G3761} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, they{G846} also{G2532} took{G1684}{(G5627)}{G1519} shipping{G4143}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} to{G1519} Capernaum{G2584}, seeking for{G2212}{(G5723)} Jesus{G2424}."
John,6,25,"And{G2532} when they had found{G2147}{(G5631)} him{G846} on the other side{G4008} of the sea{G2281}, they said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Rabbi{G4461}, when{G4219} camest thou{G1096}{(G5754)} hither{G5602}?"
John,6,26,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, Ye seek{G2212}{(G5719)} me{G3165}, not{G3756} because{G3754} ye saw{G1492}{(G5627)} the miracles{G4592}, but{G235} because{G3754} ye did eat{G5315}{(G5627)} of{G1537} the loaves{G740}, and{G2532} were filled{G5526}{(G5681)}."
John,6,27,"Labour{G2038}{(G5737)} not{G3361} for the meat{G1035} which{G3588} perisheth{G622}{(G5734)}, but{G235} for that meat{G1035} which{G3588} endureth{G3306}{(G5723)} unto{G1519} everlasting{G166} life{G2222}, which{G3739} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} shall give{G1325}{(G5692)} unto you{G5213}: for{G1063} him{G5126} hath{G4972} God{G2316} the Father{G3962} sealed{G4972}{(G5656)}."
John,6,28,"Then{G3767} said they{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, What{G5101} shall we do{G4160}{(G5719)}{(G5625)}{G4160}{(G5725)}, that{G2443} we might work{G2038}{(G5741)} the works{G2041} of God{G2316}?"
John,6,29,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, This{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the work{G2041} of God{G2316}, that{G2443} ye believe{G4100}{(G5661)} on{G1519} him{G3739} whom{G1565} he hath sent{G649}{(G5656)}."
John,6,30,"They said{G2036}{(G5627)} therefore{G3767} unto him{G846}, What{G5101} sign{G4592} shewest{G4160}{(G5719)} thou{G4771} then{G3767}, that{G2443} we may see{G1492}{(G5632)}, and{G2532} believe{G4100}{(G5661)} thee{G4671}? what{G5101} dost thou work{G2038}{(G5736)}?"
John,6,31,"Our{G2257} fathers{G3962} did eat{G5315}{(G5627)} manna{G3131} in{G1722} the desert{G2048}; as{G2531} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} written{G1125}{(G5772)}, He gave{G1325}{(G5656)} them{G846} bread{G740} from{G1537} heaven{G3772} to eat{G5315}{(G5629)}."
John,6,32,"Then{G3767} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, Moses{G3475} gave{G1325}{(G5758)} you{G5213} not{G3756} that bread{G740} from{G1537} heaven{G3772}; but{G235} my{G3450} Father{G3962} giveth{G1325}{(G5719)} you{G5213} the true{G228} bread{G740} from{G1537} heaven{G3772}."
John,6,33,"For{G1063} the bread{G740} of God{G2316} is he{G2076}{(G5748)} which{G3588} cometh down{G2597}{(G5723)} from{G1537} heaven{G3772}, and{G2532} giveth{G1325}{(G5723)} life{G2222} unto the world{G2889}."
John,6,34,"Then{G3767} said they{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, evermore{G3842} give{G1325}{(G5628)} us{G2254} this{G5126} bread{G740}."
John,6,35,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the bread{G740} of life{G2222}: he that cometh{G2064}{(G5740)} to{G4314} me{G3165} shall never{G3364} hunger{G3983}{(G5661)}; and{G2532} he that believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} on{G1519} me{G1691} shall{G1372} never{G3364}{G4455} thirst{G1372}{(G5661)}."
John,6,36,"But{G235} I said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} ye{G3708} also{G2532} have seen{G3708}{(G5758)} me{G3165}, and{G2532} believe{G4100}{(G5719)} not{G3756}."
John,6,37,All{G3956} that{G3739} the Father{G3962} giveth{G1325}{(G5719)} me{G3427} shall come{G2240}{(G5692)} to{G4314} me{G1691}; and{G2532} him that cometh{G2064}{(G5740)} to{G4314} me{G3165} I will{G1544} in no wise{G3364} cast{G1544}{(G5632)} out{G1854}.
John,6,38,"For{G3754} I came down{G2597}{(G5758)} from{G1537} heaven{G3772}, not{G3756} to{G2443} do{G4160}{(G5725)} mine own{G1699} will{G2307}, but{G235} the will{G2307} of him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,6,39,"And{G1161} this{G5124} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the Father's{G3962} will{G2307} which{G3588} hath sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}, that{G2443} of all{G3956} which{G3739} he hath given{G1325}{(G5758)} me{G3427} I should lose{G622}{(G5661)} nothing{G3361}{G1537}{G846}, but{G235} should raise{G450} it{G846} up again{G450}{(G5692)} at{G1722} the last{G2078} day{G2250}."

John,6,53,"Then{G3767} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, Except{G3362} ye eat{G5315}{(G5632)} the flesh{G4561} of the Son{G5207} of man{G444}, and{G2532} drink{G4095}{(G5632)} his{G846} blood{G129}, ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} life{G2222} in{G1722} you{G1438}."
John,6,54,"Whoso eateth{G5176}{(G5723)} my{G3450} flesh{G4561}, and{G2532} drinketh{G4095}{(G5723)} my{G3450} blood{G129}, hath{G2192}{(G5719)} eternal{G166} life{G2222}; and{G2532} I{G1473} will raise{G450} him{G846} up{G450}{(G5692)} at the last{G2078} day{G2250}."
John,6,55,"For{G1063} my{G3450} flesh{G4561} is{G2076}{(G5748)} meat{G1035} indeed{G230}, and{G2532} my{G3450} blood{G129} is{G2076}{(G5748)} drink{G4213} indeed{G230}."
John,6,56,"He that eateth{G5176}{(G5723)} my{G3450} flesh{G4561}, and{G2532} drinketh{G4095}{(G5723)} my{G3450} blood{G129}, dwelleth{G3306}{(G5719)} in{G1722} me{G1698}, and I{G2504} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,6,57,"As{G2531} the living{G2198}{(G5723)} Father{G3962} hath sent{G649}{(G5656)} me{G3165}, and I{G2504} live{G2198}{(G5719)} by{G1223} the Father{G3962}: so{G2532} he that eateth{G5176}{(G5723)} me{G3165}, even he{G2548} shall live{G2198}{(G5695)} by{G1223} me{G1691}."
John,6,58,"This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} that bread{G740} which{G3588} came down{G2597}{(G5631)} from{G1537} heaven{G3772}: not{G3756} as{G2531} your{G5216} fathers{G3962} did eat{G5315}{(G5627)} manna{G3131}, and{G2532} are dead{G599}{(G5627)}: he that eateth{G5176}{(G5723)} of this{G5126} bread{G740} shall live{G2198}{(G5695)} for{G1519} ever{G165}."
John,6,59,"These things{G5023} said he{G2036}{(G5627)} in{G1722} the synagogue{G4864}, as he taught{G1321}{(G5723)} in{G1722} Capernaum{G2584}."
John,6,60,"Many{G4183} therefore{G3767} of{G1537} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, when they had heard{G191}{(G5660)} this, said{G2036}{(G5627)}, This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} an hard{G4642} saying{G3056}; who{G5101} can{G1410}{(G5736)} hear{G191}{(G5721)} it{G846}?"
John,6,61,"When{G1161} Jesus{G2424} knew{G1492}{(G5761)} in{G1722} himself{G1438} that{G3754} his{G846} disciples{G3101} murmured{G1111}{(G5719)} at{G4012} it{G5127}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Doth this{G5124} offend{G4624}{(G5719)} you{G5209}?"
John,6,62,What and{G3767} if{G1437} ye shall see{G2334}{(G5725)} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} ascend up{G305}{(G5723)} where{G3699} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} before{G4386}?
John,6,63,"It is{G2076}{(G5748)} the spirit{G4151} that quickeneth{G2227}{(G5723)}; the flesh{G4561}{G3756} profiteth{G5623}{(G5719)} nothing{G3762}: the words{G4487} that{G3739} I{G1473} speak{G2980}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, they are{G2076}{(G5748)} spirit{G4151}, and{G2532} they are{G2076}{(G5748)} life{G2222}."
John,6,64,"But{G235} there are{G1526}{(G5748)} some{G5100} of{G1537} you{G5216} that{G3739} believe{G4100}{(G5719)} not{G3756}. For{G1063} Jesus{G2424} knew{G1492}{(G5715)} from{G1537} the beginning{G746} who{G5101} they were{G1526}{(G5748)} that believed{G4100}{(G5723)} not{G3361}, and{G2532} who{G5101} should{G2076}{(G5748)} betray{G3860}{(G5694)} him{G846}."
John,6,65,"And{G2532} he said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Therefore{G1223}{G5124} said I{G2046}{(G5758)} unto you{G5213}, that{G3754} no man{G3762} can{G1410}{(G5736)} come{G2064}{(G5629)} unto{G4314} me{G3165}, except{G3362} it were{G5600}{(G5753)} given{G1325}{(G5772)} unto him{G846} of{G1537} my{G3450} Father{G3962}."
John,6,66,"From{G1537} that{G5127} time many{G4183} of his{G846} disciples{G3101} went{G565}{(G5627)} back{G1519}{G3694}, and{G2532} walked{G4043}{(G5707)} no more{G3765} with{G3326} him{G846}."
John,6,67,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto the twelve{G1427},{G3361} Will{G2309}{(G5719)} ye{G5210} also{G2532} go away{G5217}{(G5721)}?"
John,6,68,"Then{G3767} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, to{G4314} whom{G5101} shall we go{G565}{(G5695)}? thou hast{G2192}{(G5719)} the words{G4487} of eternal{G166} life{G2222}."
John,6,69,"And{G2532} we{G2249} believe{G4100}{(G5758)} and{G2532} are sure{G1097}{(G5758)} that{G3754} thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} that Christ{G5547}, the Son{G5207} of the living{G2198}{(G5723)} God{G2316}."
John,6,70,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, Have{G1586} not{G3756} I{G1473} chosen{G1586}{(G5668)} you{G5209} twelve{G1427}, and{G2532} one{G1520} of{G1537} you{G5216} is{G2076}{(G5748)} a devil{G1228}?"
John,6,71,"{G1161} He spake{G3004}{(G5707)} of Judas{G2455} Iscariot{G2469} the son of Simon{G4613}: for{G1063} he{G3778} it was that should{G3195}{(G5707)} betray{G3860}{(G5721)} him{G846}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} one{G1520} of{G1537} the twelve{G1427}."
John,7,1,"{G2532} After{G3326} these things{G5023} Jesus{G2424} walked{G4043}{(G5707)} in{G1722} Galilee{G1056}: for{G1063} he would{G2309}{(G5707)} not{G3756} walk{G4043}{(G5721)} in{G1722} Jewry{G2449}, because{G3754} the Jews{G2453} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} to kill{G615}{(G5658)} him{G846}."
John,7,2,Now{G1161} the Jews{G2453}' feast{G1859} of tabernacles{G4634} was{G2258}{(G5713)} at hand{G1451}.
John,7,3,"His{G846} brethren{G80} therefore{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Depart{G3327}{(G5628)} hence{G1782}, and{G2532} go{G5217}{(G5720)} into{G1519} Judaea{G2449}, that{G2443} thy{G4675} disciples{G3101} also{G2532} may see{G2334}{(G5661)} the works{G2041} that{G3739} thou{G4675} doest{G4160}{(G5719)}."
John,7,4,"For{G1063} there is no man{G3762} that doeth{G4160}{(G5719)} any thing{G5100} in{G1722} secret{G2927}, and{G2532} he himself{G846} seeketh{G2212}{(G5719)} to be{G1511}{(G5750)} known openly{G1722}{G3954}. If{G1487} thou do{G4160}{(G5719)} these things{G5023}, shew{G5319}{(G5657)} thyself{G4572} to the world{G2889}."
John,7,5,For{G1063} neither{G3761} did{G4100} his{G846} brethren{G80} believe{G4100}{(G5707)} in{G1519} him{G846}.
John,7,6,"Then{G3767} Jesus{G2424} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, My{G1699} time{G2540} is{G3918} not yet{G3768} come{G3918}{(G5748)}: but{G1161} your{G5212} time{G2540} is{G2076}{(G5748)} alway{G3842} ready{G2092}."
John,7,7,"The world{G2889} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} hate{G3404}{(G5721)} you{G5209}; but{G1161} me{G1691} it hateth{G3404}{(G5719)}, because{G3754} I{G1473} testify{G3140}{(G5719)} of{G4012} it{G846}, that{G3754} the works{G2041} thereof{G846} are{G2076}{(G5748)} evil{G4190}."
John,7,8,Go{G305} ye{G5210} up{G305}{(G5628)} unto{G1519} this{G5026} feast{G1859}: I{G1473} go{G305} not{G3768} up{G305}{(G5719)} yet{G3768} unto{G1519} this{G5026} feast{G1859}; for{G3754} my{G1699} time{G2540} is{G4137} not yet{G3768} full come{G4137}{(G5769)}.
John,7,9,"When{G1161} he had said{G2036}{(G5631)} these words{G5023} unto them{G846}, he abode{G3306}{(G5656)} still in{G1722} Galilee{G1056}."
John,7,10,"But{G1161} when{G5613} his{G846} brethren{G80} were gone up{G305}{(G5627)}, then{G5119} went{G305} he{G846} also{G2532} up{G305}{(G5627)} unto{G1519} the feast{G1859}, not{G3756} openly{G5320}, but{G235} as it were{G5613} in{G1722} secret{G2927}."
John,7,11,"Then{G3767} the Jews{G2453} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} him{G846} at{G1722} the feast{G1859}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Where{G4226} is{G2076}{(G5748)} he{G1565}?"
John,7,12,"And{G2532} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} much{G4183} murmuring{G1112} among{G1722} the people{G3793} concerning{G4012} him{G846}: for some{G3303} said{G3004}{(G5707)},{G3754} He is{G2076}{(G5748)} a good man{G18}: others{G1161}{G243} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Nay{G3756}; but{G235} he deceiveth{G4105}{(G5719)} the people{G3793}."
John,7,13,Howbeit{G3305} no man{G3762} spake{G2980}{(G5707)} openly{G3954} of{G4012} him{G846} for{G1223} fear{G5401} of the Jews{G2453}.
John,7,14,"Now{G2235} about{G1161} the midst of{G3322}{(G5723)} the feast{G1859} Jesus{G2424} went up{G305}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the temple{G2411}, and{G2532} taught{G1321}{(G5707)}."
John,7,15,"And{G2532} the Jews{G2453} marvelled{G2296}{(G5707)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, How{G4459} knoweth{G1492}{(G5758)} this man{G3778} letters{G1121}, having{G3129} never{G3361} learned{G3129}{(G5761)}?"
John,7,16,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, My{G1699} doctrine{G1322} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} mine{G1699}, but{G235} his that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,7,17,"If{G1437} any man{G5100} will{G2309}{(G5725)} do{G4160}{(G5721)} his{G846} will{G2307}, he shall know{G1097}{(G5695)} of{G4012} the doctrine{G1322}, whether{G4220} it be{G2076}{(G5748)} of{G1537} God{G2316}, or{G2228} whether I{G1473} speak{G2980}{(G5719)} of{G575} myself{G1683}."
John,7,18,"He that speaketh{G2980}{(G5723)} of{G575} himself{G1438} seeketh{G2212}{(G5719)} his own{G2398} glory{G1391}: but{G1161} he that seeketh{G2212}{(G5723)} his glory{G1391} that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} him{G846}, the same{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227}, and{G2532} no{G3756} unrighteousness{G93} is{G2076}{(G5748)} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,7,19,"Did{G1325} not{G3756} Moses{G3475} give{G1325}{(G5758)} you{G5213} the law{G3551}, and{G2532} yet none{G3762} of{G1537} you{G5216} keepeth{G4160}{(G5719)} the law{G3551}? Why{G5101} go ye about{G2212}{(G5719)} to kill{G615}{(G5658)} me{G3165}?"
John,7,20,"The people{G3793} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Thou hast{G2192}{(G5719)} a devil{G1140}: who{G5101} goeth about{G2212}{(G5719)} to kill{G615}{(G5658)} thee{G4571}?"
John,7,21,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, I have done{G4160}{(G5656)} one{G1520} work{G2041}, and{G2532} ye{G2296} all{G3956} marvel{G2296}{(G5719)}."
John,7,22,"Moses{G3475} therefore{G1223}{G5124} gave{G1325}{(G5758)} unto you{G5213} circumcision{G4061};(not{G3756} because{G3754} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} of{G1537} Moses{G3475}, but{G235} of{G1537} the fathers{G3962};) and{G2532} ye{G4059} on{G1722} the sabbath day{G4521} circumcise{G4059}{(G5719)} a man{G444}."
John,7,23,"If{G1487} a man{G444} on{G1722} the sabbath day{G4521} receive{G2983}{(G5719)} circumcision{G4061}, that{G3363} the law{G3551} of Moses{G3475} should{G3089} not{G3363} be broken{G3089}{(G5686)}; are ye angry{G5520}{(G5719)} at me{G1698}, because{G3754} I have made{G4160}{(G5656)} a man{G444} every whit{G3650} whole{G5199} on{G1722} the sabbath day{G4521}?"
John,7,24,"Judge{G2919}{(G5720)} not{G3361} according to{G2596} the appearance{G3799}, but{G235} judge{G2919}{(G5657)} righteous{G1342} judgment{G2920}."
John,7,25,"Then{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} some{G5100} of{G1537} them of Jerusalem{G2415}, Is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} this{G3778} he, whom{G3739} they seek{G2212}{(G5719)} to kill{G615}{(G5658)}?"
John,7,26,"But{G2532}, lo{G2396}, he speaketh{G2980}{(G5719)} boldly{G3954}, and{G2532} they say{G3004}{(G5719)} nothing{G3762} unto him{G846}. Do{G1097} the rulers{G758} know{G1097}{(G5627)} indeed{G3379}{G230} that{G3754} this{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the very{G230} Christ{G5547}?"
John,7,27,"Howbeit{G235} we know{G1492}{(G5758)} this man{G5126} whence{G4159} he is{G2076}{(G5748)}: but{G1161} when{G3752} Christ{G5547} cometh{G2064}{(G5741)}, no man{G3762} knoweth{G1097}{(G5719)} whence{G4159} he is{G2076}{(G5748)}."
John,7,28,"Then{G3767} cried{G2896}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} in{G1722} the temple{G2411} as he taught{G1321}{(G5723)},{G2532} saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Ye both{G2504} know me{G1492}{(G5758)}, and{G2532} ye know{G1492}{(G5758)} whence{G4159} I am{G1510}{(G5748)}: and{G2532} I am{G2064} not{G3756} come{G2064}{(G5754)} of{G575} myself{G1683}, but{G235} he that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G228}, whom{G3739} ye{G5210} know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756}."
John,7,29,"But{G1161} I{G1473} know{G1492}{(G5758)} him{G846}: for{G3754} I am{G1510}{(G5748)} from{G3844} him{G846}, and he{G2548} hath sent{G649}{(G5656)} me{G3165}."
John,7,30,"Then{G3767} they sought{G2212}{(G5707)} to take{G4084}{(G5658)} him{G846}: but{G2532} no man{G3762} laid{G1911}{(G5627)} hands{G5495} on{G1909} him{G846}, because{G3754} his{G846} hour{G5610} was{G2064} not yet{G3768} come{G2064}{(G5715)}."
John,7,31,"And{G1161} many{G4183} of{G1537} the people{G3793} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)},{G3754} When{G3752} Christ{G5547} cometh{G2064}{(G5632)}, will he do{G3385}{G4160}{(G5692)} more{G4119} miracles{G4592} than these{G5130} which{G3739} this{G3778} man hath done{G4160}{(G5656)}?"
John,7,32,The Pharisees{G5330} heard{G191}{(G5656)} that the people{G3793} murmured{G1111}{(G5723)} such things{G5023} concerning{G4012} him{G846}; and{G2532} the Pharisees{G5330} and{G2532} the chief priests{G749} sent{G649}{(G5656)} officers{G5257} to{G2443} take{G4084}{(G5661)} him{G846}.
John,7,33,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto them{G846}, Yet{G2089} a little{G3398} while{G5550} am I{G1510}{(G5748)} with{G3326} you{G5216}, and{G2532} then I go{G5217}{(G5719)} unto{G4314} him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,7,34,"Ye shall seek{G2212}{(G5692)} me{G3165}, and{G2532} shall{G2147} not{G3756} find{G2147}{(G5692)} me: and{G2532} where{G3699} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)}, thither ye{G5210} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} come{G2064}{(G5629)}."
John,7,35,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} the Jews{G2453} among{G4314} themselves{G1438}, Whither{G4226} will{G3195}{(G5719)} he{G3778} go{G4198}{(G5738)}, that{G3754} we{G2249} shall{G2147} not{G3756} find{G2147}{(G5692)} him{G846}? will{G3361}{G3195}{(G5719)} he go{G4198}{(G5738)} unto{G1519} the dispersed{G1290} among the Gentiles{G1672}, and{G2532} teach{G1321}{(G5721)} the Gentiles{G1672}?"
John,7,36,"What{G5101} manner of saying{G3056} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778} that{G3739} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Ye shall seek{G2212}{(G5692)} me{G3165}, and{G2532} shall{G2147} not{G3756} find{G2147}{(G5692)} me: and{G2532} where{G3699} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)}, thither ye{G5210} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} come{G2064}{(G5629)}?"
John,7,37,"{G1161} In{G1722} the last{G2078} day{G2250}, that great{G3173} day of the feast{G1859}, Jesus{G2424} stood{G2476}{(G5715)} and{G2532} cried{G2896}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, If{G1437} any man{G5100} thirst{G1372}{(G5725)}, let him come{G2064}{(G5737)} unto{G4314} me{G3165}, and{G2532} drink{G4095}{(G5720)}."
John,7,38,"He that believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} on{G1519} me{G1691}, as{G2531} the scripture{G1124} hath said{G2036}{(G5627)}, out of{G1537} his{G846} belly{G2836} shall flow{G4482}{(G5692)} rivers{G4215} of living{G2198}{(G5723)} water{G5204}."
John,7,39,"(But{G1161} this{G5124} spake he{G2036}{(G5627)} of{G4012} the Spirit{G4151}, which{G3739} they that believe{G4100}{(G5723)} on{G1519} him{G846} should{G3195}{(G5707)} receive{G2983}{(G5721)}: for{G1063} the Holy{G40} Ghost{G4151} was{G2258}{(G5713)} not yet{G3768} given; because{G3754} that Jesus{G2424} was{G1392} not yet{G3764} glorified{G1392}{(G5681)}.)"
John,7,40,"Many{G4183} of{G1537} the people{G3793} therefore{G3767}, when they heard{G191}{(G5660)} this saying{G3056}, said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Of a truth{G230} this{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the Prophet{G4396}."
John,7,41,"Others{G243} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the Christ{G5547}. But{G1161} some{G243} said{G3004}{(G5707)},{G1063} Shall{G3361} Christ{G5547} come{G2064}{(G5736)} out of{G1537} Galilee{G1056}?"
John,7,42,"Hath not{G3780} the scripture{G1124} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, That{G3754} Christ{G5547} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} of{G1537} the seed{G4690} of David{G1138}, and{G2532} out of{G575} the town{G2968} of Bethlehem{G965}, where{G3699} David{G1138} was{G2258}{(G5713)}?"
John,7,43,So{G3767} there was{G1096}{(G5633)} a division{G4978} among{G1722} the people{G3793} because{G1223} of him{G846}.
John,7,44,And{G1161} some{G5100} of{G1537} them{G846} would{G2309}{(G5707)} have taken{G4084}{(G5658)} him{G846}; but{G235} no man{G3762} laid{G1911}{(G5627)} hands{G5495} on{G1909} him{G846}.
John,7,45,"Then{G3767} came{G2064}{(G5627)} the officers{G5257} to{G4314} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} Pharisees{G5330}; and{G2532} they{G1565} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G1302} have ye{G71} not{G3756} brought{G71}{(G5627)} him{G846}?"
John,7,46,"The officers{G5257} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, Never{G3763} man{G444} spake{G3779}{G2980}{(G5656)} like{G5613} this{G3778} man{G444}."
John,7,47,"Then{G3767} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846} the Pharisees{G5330}, Are{G4105} ye{G5210} also{G2532} deceived{G4105}{(G5769)}{G3361}?"
John,7,48,Have any{G3387} of{G1537} the rulers{G758} or{G2228} of{G1537} the Pharisees{G5330} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846}?
John,7,49,But{G235} this{G3778} people{G3793} who{G3588} knoweth{G1097}{(G5723)} not{G3361} the law{G3551} are{G1526}{(G5748)} cursed{G1944}.
John,7,50,"Nicodemus{G3530} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto{G4314} them{G846},(he that came{G2064}{(G5631)} to Jesus{G846} by{G4314} night{G3571}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} one{G1520} of{G1537} them{G846},)"
John,7,51,"Doth{G2919} our{G2257} law{G3551} judge{G2919}{(G5719)}{G3361} any man{G444}, before{G4386}{G3362} it hear{G191}{(G5661)}{G3844} him{G846}, and{G2532} know{G1097}{(G5632)} what{G5101} he doeth{G4160}{(G5719)}?"
John,7,52,"They answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Art{G3361}{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771} also{G2532} of{G1537} Galilee{G1056}? Search{G2045}{(G5657)}, and{G2532} look{G1492}: for{G3754} out of{G1537} Galilee{G1056} ariseth{G1453}{(G5769)} no{G3756} prophet{G4396}."
John,7,53,And{G2532} every man{G1538} went{G4198}{(G5675)} unto{G1519} his own{G846} house{G3624}.
John,8,1,{G1161} Jesus{G2424} went{G4198}{(G5675)} unto{G1519} the mount{G3735} of Olives{G1636}.
John,8,2,"And{G1161} early in the morning{G3722} he came{G3854}{(G5633)} again{G3825} into{G1519} the temple{G2411}, and{G2532} all{G3956} the people{G2992} came{G2064}{(G5711)} unto{G4314} him{G846}; and{G2532} he sat down{G2523}{(G5660)}, and taught{G1321}{(G5707)} them{G846}."
John,8,3,"And{G1161} the scribes{G1122} and{G2532} Pharisees{G5330} brought{G71}{(G5719)} unto{G4314} him{G846} a woman{G1135} taken{G2638}{(G5772)} in{G1722} adultery{G3430}; and{G2532} when they had set{G2476}{(G5660)} her{G846} in{G1722} the midst{G3319},"
John,8,4,"They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Master{G1320}, this{G3778} woman{G1135} was taken{G2638}{(G5681)} in adultery{G3431}{(G5746)}, in the very act{G1888}."
John,8,5,"Now{G1161} Moses{G3475} in{G1722} the law{G3551} commanded{G1781}{(G5662)} us{G2254}, that such{G5108} should be stoned{G3036}{(G5745)}: but{G3767} what{G5101} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} thou{G4771}?"
John,8,6,"{G1161} This{G5124} they said{G3004}{(G5707)}, tempting{G3985}{(G5723)} him{G846}, that{G2443} they might have{G2192}{(G5725)} to accuse{G2723}{(G5721)} him{G846}. But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} stooped{G2955}{(G5660)} down{G2736}, and with his finger{G1147} wrote{G1125}{(G5707)} on{G1519} the ground{G1093}, as though he heard{G4364}{(G5740)} them not{G3361}."
John,8,7,"So{G1161} when{G5613} they continued{G1961}{(G5707)} asking{G2065}{(G5723)} him{G846}, he lifted up himself{G352}{(G5660)}, and said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, He that is without sin{G361} among you{G5216}, let him{G906} first{G4413} cast{G906}{(G5628)} a stone{G3037} at{G1909} her{G846}."
John,8,8,"And{G2532} again{G3825} he stooped{G2955}{(G5660)} down{G2736}, and wrote{G1125}{(G5707)} on{G1519} the ground{G1093}."
John,8,9,"And{G1161} they which heard{G191}{(G5660)} it,{G2532} being convicted{G1651}{(G5746)} by{G5259} their own conscience{G4893}, went out{G1831}{(G5711)} one by one{G1527}, beginning{G756}{(G5671)} at{G575} the eldest{G4245}, even unto{G2193} the last{G2078}: and{G2532} Jesus{G2424} was left{G2641}{(G5681)} alone{G3441}, and{G2532} the woman{G1135} standing{G2476}{(G5761)} in{G1722} the midst{G3319}."
John,8,10,"When{G1161} Jesus{G2424} had lifted up himself{G352}{(G5660)}, and{G2532} saw{G2300}{(G5666)} none{G3367} but{G4133} the woman{G1135}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, Woman{G1135}, where{G4226} are{G1526}{(G5748)} those{G1565} thine{G4675} accusers{G2725}? hath{G2632} no man{G3762} condemned{G2632}{(G5656)} thee{G4571}?"
John,8,11,"{G1161} She said{G2036}{(G5627)}, No man{G3762}, Lord{G2962}. And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, Neither{G3761} do{G2632} I{G1473} condemn{G2632}{(G5719)} thee{G4571}: go{G4198}{(G5737)}, and{G2532} sin{G264}{(G5720)} no more{G3371}."
John,8,12,"Then{G3767} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} again{G3825} unto them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the light{G5457} of the world{G2889}: he that followeth{G190}{(G5723)} me{G1698} shall{G4043} not{G3364} walk{G4043}{(G5692)} in{G1722} darkness{G4653}, but{G235} shall have{G2192}{(G5692)} the light{G5457} of life{G2222}."
John,8,13,"The Pharisees{G5330} therefore{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Thou{G4771} bearest record{G3140}{(G5719)} of{G4012} thyself{G4572}; thy{G4675} record{G3141} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} true{G227}."
John,8,14,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Though{G2579} I{G1473} bear record{G3140}{(G5725)} of{G4012} myself{G1683}, yet my{G3450} record{G3141} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227}: for{G3754} I know{G1492}{(G5758)} whence{G4159} I came{G2064}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} whither{G4226} I go{G5217}{(G5719)}; but{G1161} ye{G5210} cannot{G3756} tell{G1492}{(G5758)} whence{G4159} I come{G2064}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} whither{G4226} I go{G5217}{(G5719)}."
John,8,15,Ye{G5210} judge{G2919}{(G5719)} after{G2596} the flesh{G4561}; I{G1473} judge{G2919}{(G5719)} no{G3756} man{G3762}.
John,8,16,"And{G1161} yet{G2532} if{G1437} I{G1473} judge{G2919}{(G5725)}, my{G1699} judgment{G2920} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227}: for{G3754} I am{G1510}{(G5748)} not{G3756} alone{G3441}, but{G235} I{G1473} and{G2532} the Father{G3962} that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,8,17,"{G2532} It is{G1125} also{G1161} written{G1125}{(G5769)} in{G1722} your{G5212} law{G3551}, that{G3754} the testimony{G3141} of two{G1417} men{G444} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227}."
John,8,18,"I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} one that bear witness{G3140}{(G5723)} of{G4012} myself{G1683}, and{G2532} the Father{G3962} that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165} beareth witness{G3140}{(G5719)} of{G4012} me{G1700}."
John,8,19,"Then{G3767} said they{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, Where{G4226} is{G2076}{(G5748)} thy{G4675} Father{G3962}? Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, Ye{G1492} neither{G3777} know{G1492}{(G5758)} me{G1691}, nor{G3777} my{G3450} Father{G3962}: if{G1487} ye had known{G1492}{(G5715)} me{G1691},{G2532} ye should have known{G1492}{(G5715)} my{G3450} Father{G3962} also{G302}."
John,8,20,"These{G5023} words{G4487} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} in{G1722} the treasury{G1049}, as he taught{G1321}{(G5723)} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}: and{G2532} no man{G3762} laid hands{G4084}{(G5656)} on him{G846}; for{G3754} his{G846} hour{G5610} was{G2064} not yet{G3768} come{G2064}{(G5715)}."
John,8,21,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} again{G3825} unto them{G846}, I{G1473} go my way{G5217}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} ye shall seek{G2212}{(G5692)} me{G3165}, and{G2532} shall die{G599}{(G5695)} in{G1722} your{G5216} sins{G266}: whither{G3699} I{G1473} go{G5217}{(G5719)}, ye{G5210} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} come{G2064}{(G5629)}."
John,8,22,"Then{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} the Jews{G2453}, Will he kill{G3385}{G615}{(G5692)} himself{G1438}? because{G3754} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, Whither{G3699} I{G1473} go{G5217}{(G5719)}, ye{G5210} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} come{G2064}{(G5629)}."
John,8,23,"And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} from{G1537} beneath{G2736}; I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} from{G1537} above{G507}: ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} of{G1537} this{G5127} world{G2889}; I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} not{G3756} of{G1537} this{G5127} world{G2889}."
John,8,24,"I said{G2036}{(G5627)} therefore{G3767} unto you{G5213}, that{G3754} ye shall die{G599}{(G5695)} in{G1722} your{G5216} sins{G266}: for{G1063} if{G3362} ye believe{G4100}{(G5661)} not{G3362} that{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he, ye shall die{G599}{(G5695)} in{G1722} your{G5216} sins{G266}."
John,8,25,"Then{G3767} said they{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, Who{G5101} art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771}? And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} saith{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Even{G3748}{G2532} the same that I said{G2980}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213} from the beginning{G746}."
John,8,26,I have{G2192}{(G5719)} many things{G4183} to say{G2980}{(G5721)} and{G2532} to judge{G2919}{(G5721)} of{G4012} you{G5216}: but{G235} he that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227}; and I{G2504} speak{G3004}{(G5719)} to{G1519} the world{G2889} those things{G5023} which{G3739} I have heard{G191}{(G5656)} of{G3844} him{G846}.
John,8,27,They understood{G1097}{(G5627)} not{G3756} that{G3754} he spake{G3004}{(G5707)} to them{G846} of the Father{G3962}.
John,8,28,"Then{G5119} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto them{G846}, When{G3752} ye have lifted up{G5312}{(G5661)} the Son{G5207} of man{G444}, then{G3767} shall ye know{G1097}{(G5695)} that{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he, and{G2532} that I do{G4160}{(G5719)} nothing{G3762} of{G575} myself{G1683}; but{G235} as{G2531} my{G3450} Father{G3962} hath taught{G1321}{(G5656)} me{G3165}, I speak{G2980}{(G5719)} these things{G5023}."
John,8,29,And{G2532} he that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165} is{G2076}{(G5748)} with{G3326} me{G1700}: the Father{G3962} hath{G863} not{G3756} left{G863}{(G5656)} me{G3165} alone{G3441}; for{G3754} I{G1473} do{G4160}{(G5719)} always{G3842} those things that please{G701} him{G846}.
John,8,30,"As he{G846} spake{G2980}{(G5723)} these words{G5023}, many{G4183} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846}."
John,8,31,"Then{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} Jesus{G2424} to{G4314} those Jews{G2453} which{G3588} believed{G4100}{(G5761)} on him{G846}, If{G1437} ye{G5210} continue{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} my{G1699} word{G3056}, then are ye{G2075}{(G5748)} my{G3450} disciples{G3101} indeed{G230};"
John,8,32,"And{G2532} ye shall know{G1097}{(G5695)} the truth{G225}, and{G2532} the truth{G225} shall make{G1659} you{G5209} free{G1659}{(G5692)}."
John,8,33,"They answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, We be{G2070}{(G5748)} Abraham's{G11} seed{G4690}, and{G2532} were{G1398} never{G4455} in bondage{G1398}{(G5758)} to any man{G3762}: how{G4459} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} thou{G4771},{G3754} Ye shall be made{G1096}{(G5695)} free{G1658}?"
John,8,34,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} Whosoever{G3956} committeth{G4160}{(G5723)} sin{G266} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the servant{G1401} of sin{G266}."
John,8,35,And{G1161} the servant{G1401} abideth{G3306}{(G5719)} not{G3756} in{G1722} the house{G3614} for{G1519} ever{G165}: but the Son{G5207} abideth{G3306}{(G5719)}{G1519} ever{G165}.
John,8,36,"If{G1437} the Son{G5207} therefore{G3767} shall make{G1659} you{G5209} free{G1659}{(G5661)}, ye shall be{G2071}{(G5704)} free{G1658} indeed{G3689}."
John,8,37,"I know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} ye are{G2075}{(G5748)} Abraham's{G11} seed{G4690}; but{G235} ye seek{G2212}{(G5719)} to kill{G615}{(G5658)} me{G3165}, because{G3754} my{G1699} word{G3056} hath{G5562} no{G3756} place{G5562}{(G5719)} in{G1722} you{G5213}."
John,8,38,I{G1473} speak{G2980}{(G5719)} that which{G3739} I have seen{G3708}{(G5758)} with{G3844} my{G3450} Father{G3962}: and{G2532} ye{G5210} do{G4160}{(G5719)} that{G3767} which{G3739} ye have seen{G3708}{(G5758)} with{G3844} your{G5216} father{G3962}.
John,8,39,"They answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Abraham{G11} is{G2076}{(G5748)} our{G2257} father{G3962}. Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, If{G1487} ye were{G2258}{(G5713)} Abraham's{G11} children{G5043}, ye would do{G4160}{(G5707)}{G302} the works{G2041} of Abraham{G11}."
John,8,40,"But{G1161} now{G3568} ye seek{G2212}{(G5719)} to kill{G615}{(G5658)} me{G3165}, a man{G444} that{G3739} hath told{G2980}{(G5758)} you{G5213} the truth{G225}, which{G3739} I have heard{G191}{(G5656)} of{G3844} God{G2316}: this{G5124} did{G4160}{(G5656)} not{G3756} Abraham{G11}."
John,8,41,"Ye{G5210} do{G4160}{(G5719)} the deeds{G2041} of your{G5216} father{G3962}. Then{G3767} said they{G2036}{(G5627)} to him{G846}, We{G2249} be{G1080} not{G3756} born{G1080}{(G5769)} of{G1537} fornication{G4202}; we have{G2192}{(G5719)} one{G1520} Father{G3962}, even God{G2316}."
John,8,42,"Jesus{G2424}{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, If{G1487} God{G2316} were{G2258}{(G5713)} your{G5216} Father{G3962}, ye would{G302} love{G25}{(G5707)} me{G1691}: for{G1063} I{G1473} proceeded forth{G1831}{(G5627)} and{G2532} came{G2240}{(G5719)} from{G1537} God{G2316}; neither{G3761}{G1063} came I{G2064}{(G5754)} of{G575} myself{G1683}, but{G235} he{G1565} sent{G649}{(G5656)} me{G3165}."
John,8,43,Why{G1302} do ye{G1097} not{G3756} understand{G1097}{(G5719)} my{G1699} speech{G2981}? even because{G3754} ye cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} hear{G191}{(G5721)} my{G1699} word{G3056}.
John,8,44,"Ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} of{G1537} your father{G3962} the devil{G1228}, and{G2532} the lusts{G1939} of your{G5216} father{G3962} ye will{G2309}{(G5719)} do{G4160}{(G5721)}. He{G1565} was{G2258}{(G5713)} a murderer{G443} from{G575} the beginning{G746}, and{G2532} abode{G2476}{(G5707)}{(G5758)} not{G3756} in{G1722} the truth{G225}, because{G3754} there is{G2076}{(G5748)} no{G3756} truth{G225} in{G1722} him{G846}. When{G3752} he speaketh{G2980}{(G5725)} a lie{G5579}, he speaketh{G2980}{(G5719)} of{G1537} his own{G2398}: for{G3754} he is{G2076}{(G5748)} a liar{G5583}, and{G2532} the father{G3962} of it{G846}."
John,8,45,"And{G1161} because{G3754} I{G1473} tell{G3004}{(G5719)} you the truth{G225}, ye believe{G4100}{(G5719)} me{G3427} not{G3756}."
John,8,46,"Which{G5101} of{G1537} you{G5216} convinceth{G1651}{(G5719)} me{G3165} of{G4012} sin{G266}? And{G1161} if{G1487} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} the truth{G225}, why{G1302} do{G4100} ye{G5210} not{G3756} believe{G4100}{(G5719)} me{G3427}?"
John,8,47,"He that is{G5607}{(G5752)} of{G1537} God{G2316} heareth{G191}{(G5719)} God's{G2316} words{G4487}: ye{G5210} therefore{G5124}{G1223} hear{G191}{(G5719)} them not{G3756}, because{G3754} ye are{G2075}{(G5748)} not{G3756} of{G1537} God{G2316}."
John,8,48,"Then{G3767} answered{G611}{(G5662)} the Jews{G2453}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Say{G3004}{(G5719)} we{G2249} not{G3756} well{G2573} that{G3754} thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} a Samaritan{G4541}, and{G2532} hast{G2192}{(G5719)} a devil{G1140}?"
John,8,49,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, I{G1473} have{G2192}{(G5719)} not{G3756} a devil{G1140}; but{G235} I honour{G5091}{(G5719)} my{G3450} Father{G3962}, and{G2532} ye{G5210} do dishonour{G818}{(G5719)} me{G3165}."
John,8,50,And{G1161} I{G1473} seek{G2212}{(G5719)} not{G3756} mine own{G3450} glory{G1391}: there is{G2076}{(G5748)} one that seeketh{G2212}{(G5723)} and{G2532} judgeth{G2919}{(G5723)}.
John,8,51,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, If{G1437} a man{G5100} keep{G5083}{(G5661)} my{G1699} saying{G3056}, he shall{G2334} never{G3364}{G1519}{G165} see{G2334}{(G5661)} death{G2288}."
John,8,52,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} the Jews{G2453} unto him{G846}, Now{G3568} we know{G1097}{(G5758)} that{G3754} thou hast{G2192}{(G5719)} a devil{G1140}. Abraham{G11} is dead{G599}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} the prophets{G4396}; and{G2532} thou{G4771} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)}, If{G1437} a man{G5100} keep{G5083}{(G5661)} my{G3450} saying{G3056}, he shall{G1089} never{G3364}{G1519}{G165} taste{G1089}{(G5695)} of death{G2288}."

John,8,56,"Your{G5216} father{G3962} Abraham{G11} rejoiced{G21}{(G5662)} to{G2443} see{G1492}{(G5632)} my{G1699} day{G2250}: and{G2532} he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} it, and{G2532} was glad{G5463}{(G5644)}."
John,8,57,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} the Jews{G2453} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Thou art{G2192}{(G5719)} not yet{G3768} fifty{G4004} years old{G2094}, and{G2532} hast thou seen{G3708}{(G5758)} Abraham{G11}?"

John,9,13,They brought{G71}{(G5719)} to{G4314} the Pharisees{G5330} him{G846} that aforetime{G4218} was blind{G5185}.
John,9,14,"And{G1161} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} the sabbath day{G4521} when{G3753} Jesus{G2424} made{G4160}{(G5656)} the clay{G4081}, and{G2532} opened{G455}{(G5656)} his{G846} eyes{G3788}."
John,9,15,"Then{G3767} again{G3825} the Pharisees{G5330} also{G2532} asked{G2065}{(G5707)} him{G846} how{G4459} he had received his sight{G308}{(G5656)}.{G1161} He said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, He put{G2007}{(G5656)} clay{G4081} upon{G1909} mine{G3450} eyes{G3788}, and{G2532} I washed{G3538}{(G5668)}, and{G2532} do see{G991}{(G5719)}."
John,9,16,"Therefore{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} some{G5100} of{G1537} the Pharisees{G5330}, This{G3778} man{G444} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} of{G3844} God{G2316}, because{G3754} he keepeth{G5083}{(G5719)} not{G3756} the sabbath day{G4521}. Others{G243} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, How{G4459} can{G1410}{(G5736)} a man{G444} that is a sinner{G268} do{G4160}{(G5721)} such{G5108} miracles{G4592}? And{G2532} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a division{G4978} among{G1722} them{G846}."
John,9,17,"They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto the blind man{G5185} again{G3825}, What{G5101} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} thou{G4771} of{G4012} him{G846}, that{G3754} he hath opened{G455}{(G5656)} thine{G4675} eyes{G3788}? He said{G2036}{(G5627)},{G3754}{G1161} He is{G2076}{(G5748)} a prophet{G4396}."
John,9,18,"But{G3767} the Jews{G2453} did{G4100} not{G3756} believe{G4100}{(G5656)} concerning{G4012} him{G846}, that{G3754} he had been{G2258}{(G5713)} blind{G5185}, and{G2532} received his sight{G308}{(G5656)}, until{G2193}{G3755} they called{G5455}{(G5656)} the parents{G1118} of him{G846} that had received his sight{G308}{(G5660)}."
John,9,19,"And{G2532} they asked{G2065}{(G5656)} them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778} your{G5216} son{G5207}, who{G3739} ye{G5210} say{G3004}{(G5719)}{G3754} was born{G1080}{(G5681)} blind{G5185}? how{G4459} then{G3767} doth he{G991} now{G737} see{G991}{(G5719)}?"
John,9,20,"His{G846} parents{G1118} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, We know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} this{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} our{G2257} son{G5207}, and{G2532} that{G3754} he was born{G1080}{(G5681)} blind{G5185}:"
John,9,21,"But{G1161} by what means{G4459} he{G991} now{G3568} seeth{G991}{(G5719)}, we know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756}; or{G2228} who{G5101} hath opened{G455}{(G5656)} his{G846} eyes{G3788}, we{G2249} know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756}: he{G846} is{G2192}{(G5719)} of age{G2244}; ask{G2065}{(G5657)} him{G846}: he{G846} shall speak{G2980}{(G5692)} for{G4012} himself{G848}."
John,9,22,"These{G5023} words spake{G2036}{(G5627)} his{G846} parents{G1118}, because{G3754} they feared{G5399}{(G5711)} the Jews{G2453}: for{G1063} the Jews{G2453} had agreed{G4934}{(G5717)} already{G2235}, that{G2443} if{G1437} any man{G5100} did confess{G3670}{(G5661)} that he{G846} was Christ{G5547}, he should be{G1096}{(G5638)} put out of the synagogue{G656}."
John,9,23,"Therefore{G1223}{G5124} said{G2036}{(G5627)} his{G846} parents{G1118},{G3754} He is{G2192}{(G5719)} of age{G2244}; ask{G2065}{(G5657)} him{G846}."
John,9,24,"Then{G3767} again{G1208}{G1537} called they{G5455}{(G5656)} the man{G444} that{G3739} was{G2258}{(G5713)} blind{G5185}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Give{G1325}{(G5628)} God{G2316} the praise{G1391}: we{G2249} know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} this{G3778} man{G444} is{G2076}{(G5748)} a sinner{G268}."
John,9,25,"{G3767} He{G1565} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Whether{G1487} he be{G2076}{(G5748)} a sinner{G268} or no, I know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756}: one thing{G1520} I know{G1492}{(G5758)}, that{G3754}, whereas I was{G5607}{(G5752)} blind{G5185}, now{G737} I see{G991}{(G5719)}."
John,9,26,"Then{G1161} said they{G2036}{(G5627)} to him{G846} again{G3825}, What{G5101} did he{G4160}{(G5656)} to thee{G4671}? how{G4459} opened he{G455}{(G5656)} thine{G4675} eyes{G3788}?"
John,9,27,"He answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, I have told{G2036}{(G5627)} you{G5213} already{G2235}, and{G2532} ye did{G191} not{G3756} hear{G191}{(G5656)}: wherefore{G5101} would{G2309}{(G5719)} ye hear{G191}{(G5721)} it again{G3825}? will{G3361}{G2309}{(G5719)} ye{G5210} also{G2532} be{G1096}{(G5635)} his{G846} disciples{G3101}?"
John,9,28,"Then{G3767} they reviled{G3058}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} his{G1565} disciple{G3101}; but{G1161} we{G2249} are{G2070}{(G5748)} Moses{G3475}' disciples{G3101}."
John,9,29,"We{G2249} know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} God{G2316} spake{G2980}{(G5758)} unto Moses{G3475}: as for this{G1161}{G5126} fellow, we know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} from whence{G4159} he is{G2076}{(G5748)}."
John,9,30,"The man{G444} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Why{G1063} herein{G1722}{G5129} is{G2076}{(G5748)} a marvellous thing{G2298}, that{G3754} ye{G5210} know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} from whence{G4159} he is{G2076}{(G5748)}, and{G2532} yet he hath opened{G455}{(G5656)} mine{G3450} eyes{G3788}."
John,9,31,"Now{G1161} we know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} God{G2316} heareth{G191}{(G5719)} not{G3756} sinners{G268}: but{G235} if{G1437} any man{G5100} be{G5600}{(G5753)} a worshipper of God{G2318}, and{G2532} doeth{G4160}{(G5725)} his{G846} will{G2307}, him{G5127} he heareth{G191}{(G5719)}."
John,9,32,Since{G1537} the world began{G165} was it{G191} not{G3756} heard{G191}{(G5681)} that{G3754} any man{G5100} opened{G455}{(G5656)} the eyes{G3788} of one that was born{G1080}{(G5772)} blind{G5185}.
John,9,33,"If{G1508} this man{G3778} were{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G1508} of{G3844} God{G2316}, he could{G1410}{(G5711)}{G3756} do{G4160}{(G5721)} nothing{G3762}."
John,9,34,"They answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Thou{G4771} wast{G1080} altogether{G3650} born{G1080}{(G5681)} in{G1722} sins{G266}, and{G2532} dost thou{G4771} teach{G1321}{(G5719)} us{G2248}? And{G2532} they cast{G1544}{(G5627)} him{G846} out{G1854}."
John,9,35,"Jesus{G2424} heard{G191}{(G5656)} that{G3754} they had cast{G1544}{(G5627)} him{G846} out{G1854}; and{G2532} when he had found{G2147}{(G5631)} him{G846}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Dost{G4100} thou{G4771} believe{G4100}{(G5719)} on{G1519} the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}?"
John,9,36,"He{G1565} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Who{G5101} is he{G2076}{(G5748)}, Lord{G2962}, that{G2443} I might believe{G4100}{(G5661)} on{G1519} him{G846}?"
John,9,37,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Thou hast{G3708} both{G2532} seen{G3708}{(G5758)} him{G846}, and{G2532} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} he{G1565} that talketh{G2980}{(G5723)} with{G3326} thee{G4675}."
John,9,38,"And{G1161} he said{G5346}{(G5713)}, Lord{G2962}, I believe{G4100}{(G5719)}. And{G2532} he worshipped{G4352}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
John,9,39,"And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, For{G1519} judgment{G2917} I{G1473} am come{G2064}{(G5627)} into{G1519} this{G5126} world{G2889}, that{G2443} they which see{G991}{(G5723)} not{G3361} might see{G991}{(G5725)}; and{G2532} that they which see{G991}{(G5723)} might be made{G1096}{(G5638)} blind{G5185}."
John,9,40,"And{G2532} some of{G1537} the Pharisees{G5330} which{G3588} were{G5607}{(G5752)} with{G3326} him{G846} heard{G191}{(G5656)} these words{G5023}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Are{G3361}{G2070}{(G5748)} we{G2249} blind{G5185} also{G2532}?"
John,9,41,"Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, If{G1487} ye were{G2258}{(G5713)} blind{G5185}, ye should{G302} have{G2192}{(G5707)} no{G3756} sin{G266}: but{G1161} now{G3568} ye say{G3004}{(G5719)},{G3754} We see{G991}{(G5719)}; therefore{G3767} your{G5216} sin{G266} remaineth{G3306}{(G5719)}."
John,10,1,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, He that entereth{G1525}{(G5740)} not{G3361} by{G1223} the door{G2374} into{G1519} the sheepfold{G4263}{G833}, but{G235} climbeth up{G305}{(G5723)} some other way{G237}, the same{G1565} is{G2076}{(G5748)} a thief{G2812} and{G2532} a robber{G3027}."
John,10,2,But{G1161} he that entereth in{G1525}{(G5740)} by{G1223} the door{G2374} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the shepherd{G4166} of the sheep{G4263}.
John,10,3,"To him{G5129} the porter{G2377} openeth{G455}{(G5719)}; and{G2532} the sheep{G4263} hear{G191}{(G5719)} his{G846} voice{G5456}: and{G2532} he calleth{G2564}{(G5719)} his own{G2398} sheep{G4263} by{G2596} name{G3686}, and{G2532} leadeth{G1806} them{G846} out{G1806}{(G5719)}."
John,10,4,"And{G2532} when{G3752} he putteth forth{G1544}{(G5632)} his own{G2398} sheep{G4263}, he goeth{G4198}{(G5736)} before{G1715} them{G846}, and{G2532} the sheep{G4263} follow{G190}{(G5719)} him{G846}: for{G3754} they know{G1492}{(G5758)} his{G846} voice{G5456}."
John,10,5,"And{G1161} a stranger{G245} will they{G190} not{G3364} follow{G190}{(G5661)}, but{G235} will flee{G5343}{(G5695)} from{G575} him{G846}: for{G3754} they know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} the voice{G5456} of strangers{G245}."
John,10,6,This{G5026} parable{G3942} spake{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto them{G846}: but{G1161} they{G1565} understood{G1097}{(G5627)} not{G3756} what things{G5101} they were{G2258}{(G5713)} which{G3739} he spake{G2980}{(G5707)} unto them{G846}.
John,10,7,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto them{G846} again{G3825}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the door{G2374} of the sheep{G4263}."
John,10,8,All{G3956} that ever{G3745} came{G2064}{(G5627)} before{G4253} me{G1700} are{G1526}{(G5748)} thieves{G2812} and{G2532} robbers{G3027}: but{G235} the sheep{G4263} did{G191} not{G3756} hear{G191}{(G5656)} them{G846}.
John,10,9,"I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the door{G2374}: by{G1223} me{G1700} if{G1437} any man{G5100} enter in{G1525}{(G5632)}, he shall be saved{G4982}{(G5701)}, and{G2532} shall go in{G1525}{(G5695)} and{G2532} out{G1831}{(G5695)}, and{G2532} find{G2147}{(G5692)} pasture{G3542}."
John,10,10,"The thief{G2812} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} not{G3756}, but{G1508} for to{G2443} steal{G2813}{(G5661)}, and{G2532} to kill{G2380}{(G5661)}, and{G2532} to destroy{G622}{(G5661)}: I{G1473} am come{G2064}{(G5627)} that{G2443} they might have{G2192}{(G5725)} life{G2222}, and{G2532} that they might have{G2192}{(G5725)} it more abundantly{G4053}."
John,10,11,I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the good{G2570} shepherd{G4166}: the good{G2570} shepherd{G4166} giveth{G5087}{(G5719)} his{G846} life{G5590} for{G5228} the sheep{G4263}.

John,10,13,"{G1161} The hireling{G3411} fleeth{G5343}{(G5719)}, because{G3754} he is{G2076}{(G5748)} an hireling{G3411}, and{G2532}{G846} careth{G3199}{(G5719)} not{G3756} for{G4012} the sheep{G4263}."
John,10,14,"I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the good{G2570} shepherd{G4166}, and{G2532} know{G1097}{(G5719)} my{G1699} sheep, and{G2532} am known{G1097}{(G5743)} of{G5259} mine{G1699}."
John,10,15,"As{G2531} the Father{G3962} knoweth{G1097}{(G5719)} me{G3165}, even so{G2504} know{G1097}{(G5719)} I{G2504} the Father{G3962}: and{G2532} I lay down{G5087}{(G5719)} my{G3450} life{G5590} for{G5228} the sheep{G4263}."
John,10,16,"And{G2532} other{G243} sheep{G4263} I have{G2192}{(G5719)}, which{G3739} are{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} of{G1537} this{G5026} fold{G833}: them also{G2548} I{G3165} must{G1163}{(G5748)} bring{G71}{(G5629)}, and{G2532} they shall hear{G191}{(G5692)} my{G3450} voice{G5456}; and{G2532} there shall be{G1096}{(G5695)} one{G3391} fold{G4167}, and one{G1520} shepherd{G4166}."
John,10,17,"Therefore{G5124}{G1223} doth{G25} my Father{G3962} love{G25}{(G5719)} me{G3165}, because{G3754} I{G1473} lay down{G5087}{(G5719)} my{G3450} life{G5590}, that{G2443} I might take{G2983}{(G5632)} it{G846} again{G3825}."

This{G5026} commandment{G1785} have I received{G2983}{(G5627)} of{G3844} my{G3450} Father{G3962}."
John,10,19,There was{G1096}{(G5633)} a division{G4978} therefore{G3767} again{G3825} among{G1722} the Jews{G2453} for{G1223} these{G5128} sayings{G3056}.
John,10,20,"And{G1161} many{G4183} of{G1537} them{G846} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, He hath{G2192}{(G5719)} a devil{G1140}, and{G2532} is mad{G3105}{(G5736)}; why{G5101} hear ye{G191}{(G5719)} him{G846}?"
John,10,21,"Others{G243} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, These{G5023} are{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} the words{G4487} of him that hath a devil{G1139}{(G5740)}. Can{G3361}{G1410}{(G5736)} a devil{G1140} open{G455}{(G5721)} the eyes{G3788} of the blind{G5185}?"
John,10,22,"And{G1161} it was{G1096}{(G5633)} at{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414} the feast of the dedication{G1456}, and{G2532} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} winter{G5494}."
John,10,23,And{G2532} Jesus{G2424} walked{G4043}{(G5707)} in{G1722} the temple{G2411} in{G1722} Solomon's{G4672} porch{G4745}.
John,10,24,"Then{G3767} came{G2944} the Jews{G2453} round about{G2944}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, How long{G2193}{G4219} dost thou make{G142}{(G5719)} us{G2257} to doubt{G5590}? If{G1487} thou{G4771} be{G1488}{(G5748)} the Christ{G5547}, tell{G2036}{(G5628)} us{G2254} plainly{G3954}."
John,10,25,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, I told{G2036}{(G5627)} you{G5213}, and{G2532} ye believed{G4100}{(G5719)} not{G3756}: the works{G2041} that{G3739} I{G1473} do{G4160}{(G5719)} in{G1722} my{G3450} Father's{G3962} name{G3686}, they{G5023} bear witness{G3140}{(G5719)} of{G4012} me{G1700}."
John,10,26,"But{G235} ye{G5210} believe{G4100}{(G5719)} not{G3756}, because{G1063} ye are{G2075}{(G5748)} not{G3756} of{G1537} my{G1699} sheep{G4263}, as{G2531} I said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto you{G5213}."
John,10,27,"My{G1699} sheep{G4263} hear{G191}{(G5719)} my{G3450} voice{G5456}, and I{G2504} know{G1097}{(G5719)} them{G846}, and{G2532} they follow{G190}{(G5719)} me{G3427}:"
John,10,28,"And I{G2504} give{G1325}{(G5719)} unto them{G846} eternal{G166} life{G2222}; and{G2532} they shall{G622} never{G3364}{G1519}{G165} perish{G622}{(G5643)}, neither{G2532}{G3756} shall{G726} any{G5100} man pluck{G726}{(G5692)} them{G846} out of{G1537} my{G3450} hand{G5495}."
John,10,29,"My{G3450} Father{G3962}, which{G3739} gave{G1325}{(G5758)} them me{G3427}, is{G2076}{(G5748)} greater than{G3187} all{G3956}; and{G2532} no{G3762} man is able{G1410}{(G5736)} to pluck{G726}{(G5721)} them out of{G1537} my{G3450} Father's{G3962} hand{G5495}."
John,10,30,I{G1473} and{G2532} my Father{G3962} are{G2070}{(G5748)} one{G1520}.
John,10,31,Then{G3767} the Jews{G2453} took up{G941}{(G5656)} stones{G3037} again{G3825} to{G2443} stone{G3034}{(G5661)} him{G846}.
John,10,32,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, Many{G4183} good{G2570} works{G2041} have I shewed{G1166}{(G5656)} you{G5213} from{G1537} my{G3450} Father{G3962}; for{G1223} which{G4169} of those{G846} works{G2041} do ye stone{G3034}{(G5719)} me{G3165}?"
John,10,33,"The Jews{G2453} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, For{G4012} a good{G2570} work{G2041} we stone{G3034}{(G5719)} thee{G4571} not{G3756}; but{G235} for{G4012} blasphemy{G988}; and{G2532} because{G3754} that thou{G4771}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} a man{G444}, makest{G4160}{(G5719)} thyself{G4572} God{G2316}."
John,10,34,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, Is it{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} written{G1125}{(G5772)} in{G1722} your{G5216} law{G3551}, I{G1473} said{G2036}{(G5656)}, Ye are{G2075}{(G5748)} gods{G2316}?"
John,10,35,"If{G1487} he called{G2036}{(G5627)} them{G1565} gods{G2316}, unto{G4314} whom{G3739} the word{G3056} of God{G2316} came{G1096}{(G5633)}, and{G2532} the scripture{G1124} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} be broken{G3089}{(G5683)};"
John,10,36,"Say{G3004}{(G5719)} ye{G5210} of him, whom{G3739} the Father{G3962} hath sanctified{G37}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} sent{G649}{(G5656)} into{G1519} the world{G2889},{G3754} Thou blasphemest{G987}{(G5719)}; because{G3754} I said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}?"
John,10,37,"If{G1487} I do{G4160}{(G5719)} not{G3756} the works{G2041} of my{G3450} Father{G3962}, believe{G4100}{(G5720)} me{G3427} not{G3361}."
John,10,38,"But{G1161} if{G1487} I do{G4160}{(G5719)}, though{G2579} ye believe{G4100}{(G5725)} not{G3361} me{G1698}, believe{G4100}{(G5657)} the works{G2041}: that{G2443} ye may know{G1097}{(G5632)}, and{G2532} believe{G4100}{(G5661)}, that{G3754} the Father{G3962} is in{G1722} me{G1698}, and I{G2504} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,10,39,"Therefore{G3767} they sought{G2212}{(G5707)} again{G3825} to take{G4084}{(G5658)} him{G846}: but{G2532} he escaped{G1831}{(G5627)} out of{G1537} their{G846} hand{G5495},"
John,10,40,And{G2532} went away{G565}{(G5627)} again{G3825} beyond{G4008} Jordan{G2446} into{G1519} the place{G5117} where{G3699} John{G2491} at first{G4412} baptized{G907}{(G5723)}{G2258}{(G5713)}; and{G2532} there{G1563} he abode{G3306}{(G5656)}.
John,10,41,"And{G2532} many{G4183} resorted{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)},{G3754} John{G2491} did{G4160}{(G5656)} no{G3303}{G3762} miracle{G4592}: but{G1161} all things{G3956} that{G3745} John{G2491} spake{G2036}{(G5627)} of{G4012} this man{G5127} were{G2258}{(G5713)} true{G227}."
John,10,42,And{G2532} many{G4183} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846} there{G1563}.
John,11,1,"Now{G1161} a certain{G5100} man was{G2258}{(G5713)} sick{G770}{(G5723)}, named Lazarus{G2976}, of{G575} Bethany{G963},{G1537} the town{G2968} of Mary{G3137} and{G2532} her{G846} sister{G79} Martha{G3136}."
John,11,2,"{G1161}(It was{G2258}{(G5713)} that Mary{G3137} which{G3588} anointed{G218}{(G5660)} the Lord{G2962} with ointment{G3464}, and{G2532} wiped{G1591}{(G5660)} his{G846} feet{G4228} with her{G846} hair{G2359}, whose{G3739} brother{G80} Lazarus{G2976} was sick{G770}{(G5707)}.)"
John,11,3,"Therefore{G3767} his sisters{G79} sent{G649}{(G5656)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Lord{G2962}, behold{G2396}, he whom{G3739} thou lovest{G5368}{(G5719)} is sick{G770}{(G5719)}."
John,11,4,"When{G1161} Jesus{G2424} heard{G191}{(G5660)} that, he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, This{G3778} sickness{G769} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} unto{G4314} death{G2288}, but{G235} for{G5228} the glory{G1391} of God{G2316}, that{G2443} the Son{G5207} of God{G2316} might be glorified{G1392}{(G5686)} thereby{G1223}{G846}."
John,11,5,"Now{G1161} Jesus{G2424} loved{G25}{(G5707)} Martha{G3136}, and{G2532} her{G846} sister{G79}, and{G2532} Lazarus{G2976}."
John,11,6,"When{G5613} he had heard{G191}{(G5656)} therefore{G3767} that{G3754} he was sick{G770}{(G5719)}, he abode{G3306}{(G5656)} two{G1417} days{G2250} still{G5119}{G3303} in{G1722} the same place{G5117} where{G3739} he was{G2258}{(G5713)}."
John,11,7,"Then{G1899} after{G3326} that{G5124} saith he{G3004}{(G5719)} to his disciples{G3101}, Let us go{G71}{(G5725)} into{G1519} Judaea{G2449} again{G3825}."
John,11,8,"His disciples{G3101} say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Master{G4461}, the Jews{G2453} of late{G3568} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} to stone{G3034}{(G5658)} thee{G4571}; and{G2532} goest thou{G5217}{(G5719)} thither{G1563} again{G3825}?"
John,11,9,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, Are there{G1526}{(G5748)} not{G3780} twelve{G1427} hours{G5610} in the day{G2250}? If{G1437} any man{G5100} walk{G4043}{(G5725)} in{G1722} the day{G2250}, he stumbleth{G4350}{(G5719)} not{G3756}, because{G3754} he seeth{G991}{(G5719)} the light{G5457} of this{G5127} world{G2889}."
John,11,10,"But{G1161} if{G1437} a man{G5100} walk{G4043}{(G5725)} in{G1722} the night{G3571}, he stumbleth{G4350}{(G5719)}, because{G3754} there is{G2076}{(G5748)} no{G3756} light{G5457} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,11,11,"These things{G5023} said{G2036}{(G5627)} he{G846}: and{G2532} after{G3326} that{G5124} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Our{G2257} friend{G5384} Lazarus{G2976} sleepeth{G2837}{(G5769)}; but{G235} I go{G4198}{(G5736)}, that{G2443} I may awake{G1852} him{G846} out of sleep{G1852}{(G5661)}."
John,11,12,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Lord{G2962}, if{G1487} he sleep{G2837}{(G5769)}, he shall do well{G4982}{(G5701)}."
John,11,13,Howbeit{G1161} Jesus{G2424} spake{G2046}{(G5715)} of{G4012} his{G846} death{G2288}: but{G1161} they{G1565} thought{G1380}{(G5656)} that{G3754} he had spoken{G3004}{(G5719)} of{G4012} taking of rest{G2838} in sleep{G5258}.
John,11,14,"Then{G5119}{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto them{G846} plainly{G3954}, Lazarus{G2976} is dead{G599}{(G5627)}."
John,11,15,"And{G2532} I am glad{G5463}{(G5719)} for{G1223} your sakes{G5209} that{G3754} I was{G2252}{(G5713)}{(G5625)}{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G3756} there{G1563}, to the intent{G2443} ye may believe{G4100}{(G5661)}; nevertheless{G235} let us go{G71}{(G5725)} unto{G4314} him{G846}."
John,11,16,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Thomas{G2381}, which{G3588} is called{G3004}{(G5746)} Didymus{G1324}, unto his fellowdisciples{G4827}, Let us{G71} also{G2532} go{G71}{(G5725)}, that{G2443} we{G2249} may die{G599}{(G5632)} with{G3326} him{G846}."
John,11,17,"Then{G3767} when Jesus{G2424} came{G2064}{(G5631)}, he found{G2147}{(G5627)} that he{G846} had{G2192}{(G5723)} lain in{G1722} the grave{G3419} four{G5064} days{G2250} already{G2235}."
John,11,18,"Now{G1161} Bethany{G963} was{G2258}{(G5713)} nigh{G1451} unto Jerusalem{G2414}, about{G5613} fifteen{G1178} furlongs{G4712} off{G575}:"
John,11,19,"And{G2532} many{G4183} of{G1537} the Jews{G2453} came{G2064}{(G5715)} to{G4314} Martha{G3136} and{G2532} Mary{G3137}{G4012}, to{G2443} comfort{G3888}{(G5667)} them{G846} concerning{G4012} their{G846} brother{G80}."
John,11,20,"Then{G3767} Martha{G3136}, as soon as{G5613} she heard{G191}{(G5656)} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} was coming{G2064}{(G5736)}, went and met{G5221}{(G5656)} him{G846}: but{G1161} Mary{G3137} sat{G2516}{(G5711)} still in{G1722} the house{G3624}."
John,11,21,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Martha{G3136} unto{G4314} Jesus{G2424}, Lord{G2962}, if{G1487} thou hadst been{G2258}{(G5713)} here{G5602}, my{G3450} brother{G80}{G302} had{G2348} not{G3756} died{G2348}{(G5715)}."
John,11,22,"But{G235} I know{G1492}{(G5758)}, that even{G2532} now{G3568}, whatsoever{G3754}{G3745}{G302} thou wilt ask{G154}{(G5672)} of God{G2316}, God{G2316} will give{G1325}{(G5692)} it thee{G4671}."
John,11,23,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Thy{G4675} brother{G80} shall rise again{G450}{(G5698)}."
John,11,24,"Martha{G3136} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, I know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} he shall rise again{G450}{(G5698)} in{G1722} the resurrection{G386} at{G1722} the last{G2078} day{G2250}."
John,11,25,"Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her{G846}, I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the resurrection{G386}, and{G2532} the life{G2222}: he that believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} in{G1519} me{G1691}, though{G2579} he were dead{G599}{(G5632)}, yet shall he live{G2198}{(G5695)}:"
John,11,26,And{G2532} whosoever{G3956} liveth{G2198}{(G5723)} and{G2532} believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} in{G1519} me{G1691} shall{G599} never{G3364}{G1519}{G165} die{G599}{(G5632)}. Believest thou{G4100}{(G5719)} this{G5124}?
John,11,27,"She saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Yea{G3483}, Lord{G2962}: I{G1473} believe{G4100}{(G5758)} that{G3754} thou{G4771} art{G1488}{(G5748)} the Christ{G5547}, the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}, which{G3588} should come{G2064}{(G5740)} into{G1519} the world{G2889}."
John,11,28,"And{G2532} when she had{G2036} so{G5023} said{G2036}{(G5631)}, she went her way{G565}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} called{G5455}{(G5656)} Mary{G3137} her{G846} sister{G79} secretly{G2977}, saying{G2036}{(G5631)}, The Master{G1320} is come{G3918}{(G5748)}, and{G2532} calleth for{G5455}{(G5719)} thee{G4571}."
John,11,29,"As soon as{G5613} she{G1565} heard{G191}{(G5656)} that, she arose{G1453}{(G5743)} quickly{G5035}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5736)} unto{G4314} him{G846}."
John,11,30,"Now{G1161} Jesus{G2424} was{G2064} not yet{G3768} come{G2064}{(G5715)} into{G1519} the town{G2968}, but{G235} was{G2258}{(G5713)} in{G1722} that place{G5117} where{G3699} Martha{G3136} met{G5221}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
John,11,31,"The Jews{G2453} then{G3767} which{G3588} were{G5607}{(G5752)} with{G3326} her{G846} in{G1722} the house{G3614}, and{G2532} comforted{G3888}{(G5740)} her{G846}, when they saw{G1492}{(G5631)} Mary{G3137}, that{G3754} she rose up{G450}{(G5627)} hastily{G5030} and{G2532} went out{G1831}{(G5627)}, followed{G190}{(G5656)} her{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)},{G3754} She goeth{G5217}{(G5719)} unto{G1519} the grave{G3419} to{G2443} weep{G2799}{(G5661)} there{G1563}."
John,11,32,"Then{G3767} when{G5613} Mary{G3137} was come{G2064}{(G5627)} where{G3699} Jesus{G2424} was{G2258}{(G5713)}, and saw{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G846}, she fell down{G4098}{(G5627)} at{G1519} his{G846} feet{G4228}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, if{G1487} thou hadst been{G2258}{(G5713)} here{G5602}, my{G3450} brother{G80} had{G302} not{G3756} died{G599}{(G5627)}."
John,11,33,"When{G5613} Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} saw{G1492}{(G5627)} her{G846} weeping{G2799}{(G5723)}, and{G2532} the Jews{G2453} also weeping{G2799}{(G5723)} which came{G4905}{(G5631)} with her{G846}, he groaned{G1690}{(G5662)} in the spirit{G4151}, and{G2532} was troubled{G5015}{(G5656)}{G1438},"
John,11,34,"And{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Where{G4226} have ye laid{G5087}{(G5758)} him{G846}? They said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, come{G2064}{(G5736)} and{G2532} see{G1492}{(G5657)}."
John,11,35,Jesus{G2424} wept{G1145}{(G5656)}.
John,11,36,"Then{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} the Jews{G2453}, Behold{G2396} how{G4459} he loved{G5368}{(G5707)} him{G846}!"
John,11,37,"And{G1161} some{G5100} of{G1537} them{G846} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Could{G1410}{(G5711)} not{G3756} this man{G3778}, which{G3588} opened{G455}{(G5660)} the eyes{G3788} of the blind{G5185}, have caused{G4160}{(G5658)} that{G2443} even{G2532} this man{G3778} should{G599} not{G3361} have died{G599}{(G5632)}?"
John,11,38,"Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} again{G3825} groaning{G1690}{(G5740)} in{G1722} himself{G1438} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G1519} the grave{G3419}.{G1161} It was{G2258}{(G5713)} a cave{G4693}, and{G2532} a stone{G3037} lay{G1945}{(G5711)} upon{G1909} it{G846}."
John,11,39,"Jesus{G2424} said{G3004}{(G5719)}, Take ye away{G142}{(G5657)} the stone{G3037}. Martha{G3136}, the sister{G79} of him that was dead{G2348}{(G5761)}, saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, by this time{G2235} he stinketh{G3605}{(G5719)}: for{G1063} he hath been{G2076}{(G5748)} dead four days{G5066}."
John,11,40,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Said I{G2036}{(G5627)} not{G3756} unto thee{G4671}, that{G3754}, if{G1437} thou wouldest believe{G4100}{(G5661)}, thou shouldest see{G3700}{(G5695)} the glory{G1391} of God{G2316}?"
John,11,41,"Then{G3767} they took away{G142}{(G5656)} the stone{G3037} from the place where{G3757} the dead{G2348}{(G5761)} was{G2258}{(G5713)} laid{G2749}{(G5740)}. And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} lifted{G142}{(G5656)} up{G507} his eyes{G3788}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Father{G3962}, I thank{G2168}{(G5719)} thee{G4671} that{G3754} thou hast heard{G191}{(G5656)} me{G3450}."
John,11,42,"And{G1161} I{G1473} knew{G1492}{(G5715)} that{G3754} thou hearest{G191}{(G5719)} me{G3450} always{G3842}: but{G235} because{G1223} of the people{G3793} which{G3588} stand by{G4026}{(G5761)} I said{G2036}{(G5627)} it, that{G2443} they may believe{G4100}{(G5661)} that{G3754} thou{G4771} hast sent{G649}{(G5656)} me{G3165}."
John,11,43,"And{G2532} when he thus{G5023} had spoken{G2036}{(G5631)}, he cried{G2905}{(G5656)} with a loud{G3173} voice{G5456}, Lazarus{G2976}, come{G1204}{(G5773)} forth{G1854}."
John,11,44,"And{G2532} he that was dead{G2348}{(G5761)} came forth{G1831}{(G5627)}, bound{G1210}{(G5772)} hand{G5495} and{G2532} foot{G4228} with graveclothes{G2750}: and{G2532} his{G846} face{G3799} was bound about{G4019}{(G5718)} with a napkin{G4676}. Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Loose{G3089}{(G5657)} him{G846}, and{G2532} let him{G863}{(G5628)} go{G5217}{(G5721)}."
John,11,45,"Then{G3767} many{G4183} of{G1537} the Jews{G2453} which{G3588} came{G2064}{(G5631)} to{G4314} Mary{G3137}, and{G2532} had seen{G2300}{(G5666)} the things which{G3739} Jesus{G2424} did{G4160}{(G5656)}, believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846}."
John,11,46,"But{G1161} some{G5100} of{G1537} them{G846} went their ways{G565}{(G5627)} to{G4314} the Pharisees{G5330}, and{G2532} told{G2036}{(G5627)} them{G846} what things{G3739} Jesus{G2424} had done{G4160}{(G5656)}."
John,11,47,"Then{G3767} gathered{G4863}{(G5627)} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the Pharisees{G5330} a council{G4892}, and{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, What{G5101} do we{G4160}{(G5719)}? for{G3754} this{G3778} man{G444} doeth{G4160}{(G5719)} many{G4183} miracles{G4592}."
John,11,48,"If{G1437} we let{G863} him{G846} thus{G3779} alone{G863}{(G5632)}, all{G3956} men will believe{G4100}{(G5692)} on{G1519} him{G846}: and{G2532} the Romans{G4514} shall come{G2064}{(G5695)} and{G2532} take away{G142}{(G5692)} both{G2532} our{G2257} place{G5117} and{G2532} nation{G1484}."
John,11,49,"And{G1161} one{G1520}{G5100} of{G1537} them{G846}, named Caiaphas{G2533}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} the high priest{G749} that same{G1565} year{G1763}, said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Ye{G5210} know{G1492}{(G5758)} nothing at all{G3756}{G3762},"
John,11,50,"Nor{G3761} consider{G1260}{(G5736)} that{G3754} it is expedient{G4851}{(G5719)} for us{G2254}, that{G2443} one{G1520} man{G444} should die{G599}{(G5632)} for{G5228} the people{G2992}, and{G2532} that the whole{G3650} nation{G1484} perish{G622}{(G5643)} not{G3361}."
John,11,51,"And{G1161} this{G5124} spake he{G2036}{(G5627)} not{G3756} of{G575} himself{G1438}: but{G235} being{G5607}{(G5752)} high priest{G749} that{G1565} year{G1763}, he prophesied{G4395}{(G5656)} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} should{G3195}{(G5707)} die{G599}{(G5721)} for that{G5228} nation{G1484};"
John,11,52,"And{G2532} not{G3756} for that{G5228} nation{G1484} only{G3440}, but{G235} that{G2443} also{G2532} he should gather together{G4863}{(G5632)} in{G1519} one{G1520} the children{G5043} of God{G2316} that were scattered abroad{G1287}{(G5772)}."
John,11,53,Then{G3767} from{G575} that{G1565} day{G2250} forth they took counsel together{G4823}{(G5668)} for to{G2443} put{G615} him{G846} to death{G615}{(G5725)}.
John,11,54,"Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} walked{G4043}{(G5707)} no more{G3765} openly{G3954} among{G1722} the Jews{G2453}; but{G235} went{G565}{(G5627)} thence{G1564} unto{G1519} a country{G5561} near{G1451} to the wilderness{G2048}, into{G1519} a city{G4172} called{G3004}{(G5746)} Ephraim{G2187}, and there{G2546} continued{G1304}{(G5707)} with{G3326} his{G846} disciples{G3101}."
John,11,55,"And{G1161} the Jews{G2453}' passover{G3957} was{G2258}{(G5713)} nigh at hand{G1451}: and{G2532} many{G4183} went{G305}{(G5627)} out of{G1537} the country{G5561} up{G1519} to Jerusalem{G2414} before{G4253} the passover{G3957}, to{G2443} purify{G48}{(G5661)} themselves{G1438}."
John,11,56,"Then{G3767} sought they for{G2212}{(G5707)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} spake{G3004}{(G5707)} among{G3326} themselves{G240}, as they stood{G2476}{(G5761)} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}, What{G5101} think{G1380}{(G5719)} ye{G5213}, that{G3754} he will{G2064} not{G3364} come{G2064}{(G5632)} to{G1519} the feast{G1859}?"
John,11,57,"Now{G1161} both{G2532} the chief priests{G749} and{G2532} the Pharisees{G5330} had given{G1325}{(G5715)} a commandment{G1785}, that{G2443}, if{G1437} any man{G5100} knew{G1097}{(G5632)} where{G4226} he were{G2076}{(G5748)}, he should shew{G3377}{(G5661)} it, that{G3704} they might take{G4084}{(G5661)} him{G846}."
John,12,1,"Then{G3767} Jesus{G2424} six{G1803} days{G2250} before{G4253} the passover{G3957} came{G2064}{(G5627)} to{G1519} Bethany{G963}, where{G3699} Lazarus{G2976} was{G2258}{(G5713)} which{G3588} had been dead{G2348}{(G5761)}, whom{G3739} he raised{G1453}{(G5656)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}."
John,12,2,There{G1563}{G3767} they made{G4160}{(G5656)} him{G846} a supper{G1173}; and{G2532} Martha{G3136} served{G1247}{(G5707)}: but{G1161} Lazarus{G2976} was{G2258}{(G5713)} one{G1520} of them that sat at the table{G4873}{(G5740)} with him{G846}.
John,12,3,"Then{G3767} took{G2983}{(G5631)} Mary{G3137} a pound{G3046} of ointment{G3464} of spikenard{G3487}{G4101}, very costly{G4186}, and anointed{G218}{(G5656)} the feet{G4228} of Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} wiped{G1591}{(G5656)} his{G846} feet{G4228} with her{G846} hair{G2359}: and{G1161} the house{G3614} was filled{G4137}{(G5681)} with{G1537} the odour{G3744} of the ointment{G3464}."
John,12,4,"Then{G3767} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} one{G1520} of{G1537} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, Judas{G2455} Iscariot{G2469}, Simon's{G4613} son, which{G3588} should{G3195}{(G5723)} betray{G3860}{(G5721)} him{G846},"
John,12,5,"Why{G1302} was{G4097} not{G3756} this{G5124} ointment{G3464} sold{G4097}{(G5681)} for three hundred{G5145} pence{G1220}, and{G2532} given{G1325}{(G5681)} to the poor{G4434}?"
John,12,6,"{G1161} This{G5124} he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, not{G3756} that{G3754} he{G846} cared{G3199}{(G5707)} for{G4012} the poor{G4434}; but{G235} because{G3754} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} a thief{G2812}, and{G2532} had{G2192}{(G5707)} the bag{G1101}, and{G2532} bare{G941}{(G5707)} what was put therein{G906}{(G5746)}."
John,12,7,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424}, Let{G863} her{G846} alone{G863}{(G5628)}: against{G1519} the day{G2250} of my{G3450} burying{G1780} hath she kept{G5083}{(G5758)} this{G846}."
John,12,8,For{G1063} the poor{G4434} always{G3842} ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} with{G3326} you{G1438}; but{G1161} me{G1691} ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} not{G3756} always{G3842}.
John,12,9,"Much{G4183} people{G3793} of{G1537} the Jews{G2453} therefore{G3767} knew{G1097}{(G5627)} that{G3754} he was{G2076}{(G5748)} there{G1563}: and{G2532} they came{G2064}{(G5627)} not{G3756} for{G1223} Jesus{G2424}' sake only{G3440}, but{G235} that{G2443} they might see{G1492}{(G5632)} Lazarus{G2976} also{G2532}, whom{G3739} he had raised{G1453}{(G5656)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}."
John,12,10,But{G1161} the chief priests{G749} consulted{G1011}{(G5662)} that{G2443} they might put{G615} Lazarus{G2976} also{G2532} to death{G615}{(G5725)};
John,12,11,"Because{G3754} that by reason{G1223} of him{G846} many{G4183} of the Jews{G2453} went away{G5217}{(G5707)}, and{G2532} believed{G4100}{(G5707)} on{G1519} Jesus{G2424}."
John,12,12,"On the next day{G1887} much{G4183} people{G3793} that were come{G2064}{(G5631)} to{G1519} the feast{G1859}, when they heard{G191}{(G5660)} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} was coming{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G1519} Jerusalem{G2414},"
John,12,13,"Took{G2983}{(G5627)} branches{G902} of palm trees{G5404}, and{G2532} went forth{G1831}{(G5627)} to{G1519} meet{G5222} him{G846}, and{G2532} cried{G2896}{(G5707)}, Hosanna{G5614}: Blessed{G2127}{(G5772)} is the King{G935} of Israel{G2474} that cometh{G2064}{(G5740)} in{G1722} the name{G3686} of the Lord{G2962}."
John,12,14,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424}, when he had found{G2147}{(G5631)} a young ass{G3678}, sat{G2523}{(G5656)} thereon{G1909}{G846}; as{G2531} it is{G2076}{(G5748)} written{G1125}{(G5772)},"
John,12,15,"Fear{G5399}{(G5732)}{(G5737)} not{G3361}, daughter{G2364} of Sion{G4622}: behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, thy{G4675} King{G935} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, sitting{G2521}{(G5740)} on{G1909} an ass's{G3688} colt{G4454}."
John,12,16,"{G1161} These things{G5023} understood{G1097}{(G5627)} not{G3756} his{G846} disciples{G3101} at the first{G4412}: but{G235} when{G3753} Jesus{G2424} was glorified{G1392}{(G5681)}, then{G5119} remembered they{G3415}{(G5681)} that{G3754} these things{G5023} were{G2258}{(G5713)} written{G1125}{(G5772)} of{G1909} him{G846}, and{G2532} that they had done{G4160}{(G5656)} these things{G5023} unto him{G846}."
John,12,17,"The people{G3793} therefore{G3767} that was{G5607}{(G5752)} with{G3326} him{G846} when{G3753} he called{G5455}{(G5656)} Lazarus{G2976} out of{G1537} his grave{G3419}, and{G2532} raised{G1453}{(G5656)} him{G846} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}, bare record{G3140}{(G5707)}."
John,12,18,"For this{G5124} cause{G1223} the people{G3793} also{G2532} met{G5221}{(G5656)} him{G846}, for that{G3754} they heard{G191}{(G5656)} that{G846} he had done{G4160}{(G5760)} this{G5124} miracle{G4592}."
John,12,19,"The Pharisees{G5330} therefore{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} among{G4314} themselves{G1438}, Perceive ye{G2334}{(G5719)}{(G5720)} how{G3754} ye prevail{G5623}{(G5719)} nothing{G3756}{G3762}? behold{G2396}, the world{G2889} is gone{G565}{(G5627)} after{G3694} him{G846}."
John,12,20,And{G1161} there were{G2258}{(G5713)} certain{G5100} Greeks{G1672} among{G1537} them that came up{G305}{(G5723)} to{G2443} worship{G4352}{(G5661)} at{G1722} the feast{G1859}:
John,12,21,"The same{G3778} came{G4334}{(G5656)} therefore{G3767} to Philip{G5376}, which was of{G575} Bethsaida{G966} of Galilee{G1056}, and{G2532} desired{G2065}{(G5707)} him{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Sir{G2962}, we would{G2309}{(G5719)} see{G1492}{(G5629)} Jesus{G2424}."
John,12,22,Philip{G5376} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} and{G2532} telleth{G3004}{(G5719)} Andrew{G406}: and{G2532} again{G3825} Andrew{G406} and{G2532} Philip{G5376} tell{G3004}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424}.
John,12,23,"And{G1161} Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, The hour{G5610} is come{G2064}{(G5754)}, that{G2443} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} should be glorified{G1392}{(G5686)}."
John,12,24,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, Except{G3362} a corn{G2848} of wheat{G4621} fall{G4098}{(G5631)} into{G1519} the ground{G1093} and die{G599}{(G5632)}, it{G846} abideth{G3306}{(G5719)} alone{G3441}: but{G1161} if{G1437} it die{G599}{(G5632)}, it bringeth forth{G5342}{(G5719)} much{G4183} fruit{G2590}."
John,12,25,He that loveth{G5368}{(G5723)} his{G846} life{G5590} shall lose{G622}{(G5692)} it{G846}; and{G2532} he that hateth{G3404}{(G5723)} his{G846} life{G5590} in{G1722} this{G5129} world{G2889} shall keep{G5442}{(G5692)} it{G846} unto{G1519} life{G2222} eternal{G166}.
John,12,26,"If{G1437} any man{G5100} serve{G1247}{(G5725)} me{G1698}, let him follow{G190}{(G5720)} me{G1698}; and{G2532} where{G3699} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)}, there{G1563} shall{G2071} also{G2532} my{G1699} servant{G1249} be{G2071}{(G5704)}:{G2532} if{G1437} any man{G5100} serve{G1247}{(G5725)} me{G1698}, him{G846} will{G5091} my Father{G3962} honour{G5091}{(G5692)}."
John,12,27,"Now{G3568} is{G5015} my{G3450} soul{G5590} troubled{G5015}{(G5769)}; and{G2532} what{G5101} shall I say{G2036}{(G5632)}? Father{G3962}, save{G4982}{(G5657)} me{G3165} from{G1537} this{G5026} hour{G5610}: but{G235} for this{G5124} cause{G1223} came I{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G1519} this{G5026} hour{G5610}."
John,12,28,"Father{G3962}, glorify{G1392}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} name{G3686}. Then{G3767} came there{G2064}{(G5627)} a voice{G5456} from{G1537} heaven{G3772}, saying, I have{G1392} both{G2532} glorified{G1392}{(G5656)} it, and{G2532} will glorify{G1392}{(G5692)} it again{G3825}."
John,12,29,"The people{G3793} therefore{G3767}, that stood by{G2476}{(G5761)}, and{G2532} heard{G191}{(G5660)} it, said{G3004}{(G5707)} that it thundered{G1096}{(G5755)}{G1027}: others{G243} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, An angel{G32} spake{G2980}{(G5758)} to him{G846}."
John,12,30,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, This{G3778} voice{G5456} came{G1096}{(G5754)} not{G3756} because of{G1223} me{G1691}, but{G235} for{G1223} your sakes{G5209}{G1223}."
John,12,31,Now{G3568} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the judgment{G2920} of this{G5127} world{G2889}: now{G3568} shall{G1544} the prince{G758} of this{G5127} world{G2889} be cast{G1544}{(G5701)} out{G1854}.
John,12,32,"And I{G2504}, if{G1437} I be lifted up{G5312}{(G5686)} from{G1537} the earth{G1093}, will draw{G1670}{(G5692)} all{G3956} men unto{G4314} me{G1683}."
John,12,33,"{G1161} This{G5124} he said{G3004}{(G5707)}, signifying{G4591}{(G5723)} what{G4169} death{G2288} he should{G3195}{(G5707)} die{G599}{(G5721)}."
John,12,34,"The people{G3793} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, We{G2249} have heard{G191}{(G5656)} out of{G1537} the law{G3551} that{G3754} Christ{G5547} abideth{G3306}{(G5719)} for{G1519} ever{G165}: and{G2532} how{G4459} sayest{G3004}{(G5719)} thou{G4771},{G3754} The Son{G5207} of man{G444} must{G1163}{(G5748)} be lifted up{G5312}{(G5683)}? who{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G3778} Son{G5207} of man{G444}?"
John,12,35,"Then{G3767} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Yet{G2089} a little{G3398} while{G5550} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the light{G5457} with{G3326} you{G5216}. Walk{G4043}{(G5720)} while{G2193} ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} the light{G5457}, lest{G3363} darkness{G4653} come upon{G2638}{(G5632)} you{G5209}: for{G2532} he that walketh{G4043}{(G5723)} in{G1722} darkness{G4653} knoweth{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} whither{G4226} he goeth{G5217}{(G5719)}."
John,12,36,"While{G2193} ye have{G2192}{(G5719)} light{G5457}, believe{G4100}{(G5720)} in{G1519} the light{G5457}, that{G2443} ye may be{G1096}{(G5638)} the children{G5207} of light{G5457}. These things{G5023} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424}, and departed{G565}{(G5631)}, and{G2532} did hide himself{G2928}{(G5648)} from{G575} them{G846}."
John,12,37,"But{G1161} though he{G846} had done{G4160}{(G5761)} so many{G5118} miracles{G4592} before{G1715} them{G846}, yet they believed{G4100}{(G5707)} not{G3756} on{G1519} him{G846}:"
John,12,38,"That{G2443} the saying{G3056} of Esaias{G2268} the prophet{G4396} might be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}, which{G3739} he spake{G2036}{(G5627)}, Lord{G2962}, who{G5101} hath believed{G4100}{(G5656)} our{G2257} report{G189}? and{G2532} to whom{G5101} hath the arm{G1023} of the Lord{G2962} been revealed{G601}{(G5681)}?"
John,12,39,"Therefore{G5124}{G1223} they could{G1410}{(G5711)} not{G3756} believe{G4100}{(G5721)}, because{G3754} that Esaias{G2268} said{G2036}{(G5627)} again{G3825},"
John,12,40,"He hath blinded{G5186}{(G5758)} their{G846} eyes{G3788}, and{G2532} hardened{G4456}{(G5758)} their{G846} heart{G2588}; that{G3363} they should{G1492} not{G3363} see{G1492}{(G5632)} with their eyes{G3788}, nor{G2532} understand{G3539}{(G5661)} with their heart{G2588}, and{G2532} be converted{G1994}{(G5652)}, and{G2532} I should heal{G2390}{(G5667)} them{G846}."
John,12,41,"These things{G5023} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Esaias{G2268}, when{G3753} he saw{G1492}{(G5627)} his{G846} glory{G1391}, and{G2532} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} of{G4012} him{G846}."
John,12,42,"Nevertheless{G3676}{G3305} among{G1537} the chief rulers{G758} also{G2532} many{G4183} believed{G4100}{(G5656)} on{G1519} him{G846}; but{G235} because{G1223} of the Pharisees{G5330} they did{G3670} not{G3756} confess{G3670}{(G5707)} him, lest{G3363} they should be{G1096}{(G5638)} put out of the synagogue{G656}:"
John,12,43,For{G1063} they loved{G25}{(G5656)} the praise{G1391} of men{G444} more{G3123} than{G2260} the praise{G1391} of God{G2316}.
John,12,44,"{G1161} Jesus{G2424} cried{G2896}{(G5656)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, He that believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} on{G1519} me{G1691}, believeth{G4100}{(G5719)} not{G3756} on{G1519} me{G1691}, but{G235} on{G1519} him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,12,45,And{G2532} he that seeth{G2334}{(G5723)} me{G1691} seeth{G2334}{(G5719)} him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}.
John,12,46,"I{G1473} am come{G2064}{(G5754)} a light{G5457} into{G1519} the world{G2889}, that{G3363} whosoever{G3956} believeth{G4100}{(G5723)} on{G1519} me{G1691} should{G3306} not{G3363} abide{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} darkness{G4653}."
John,12,47,"And{G2532} if{G3362} any man{G5100} hear{G191}{(G5661)} my{G3450} words{G4487}, and{G2532} believe{G4100}{(G5661)} not{G3362}, I{G1473} judge{G2919}{(G5692)}{(G5719)} him{G846} not{G3756}: for{G1063} I came{G2064}{(G5627)} not{G3756} to{G2443} judge{G2919}{(G5725)} the world{G2889}, but{G235} to{G2443} save{G4982}{(G5661)} the world{G2889}."
John,12,48,"He that rejecteth{G114}{(G5723)} me{G1691}, and{G2532} receiveth{G2983}{(G5723)} not{G3361} my{G3450} words{G4487}, hath{G2192}{(G5719)} one that judgeth{G2919}{(G5723)} him{G846}: the word{G3056} that{G3739} I have spoken{G2980}{(G5656)}, the same{G1565} shall judge{G2919}{(G5692)} him{G846} in{G1722} the last{G2078} day{G2250}."
John,12,49,"For{G3754} I{G1473} have{G2980} not{G3756} spoken{G2980}{(G5656)} of{G1537} myself{G1683}; but{G235} the Father{G3962} which sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}, he{G846} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} me{G3427} a commandment{G1785}, what{G5101} I should say{G2036}{(G5632)}, and{G2532} what{G5101} I should speak{G2980}{(G5661)}."
John,12,50,"And{G2532} I know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} his{G846} commandment{G1785} is{G2076}{(G5748)} life{G2222} everlasting{G166}: whatsoever{G3739} I{G1473} speak{G2980}{(G5719)} therefore{G3767}, even as{G2531} the Father{G3962} said{G2046}{(G5758)} unto me{G3427}, so{G3779} I speak{G2980}{(G5719)}."
John,13,1,"Now{G1161} before{G4253} the feast{G1859} of the passover{G3957}, when Jesus{G2424} knew{G1492}{(G5761)} that{G3754} his{G846} hour{G5610} was come{G2064}{(G5754)} that{G2443} he should depart{G3327}{(G5632)} out of{G1537} this{G5127} world{G2889} unto{G4314} the Father{G3962}, having loved{G25}{(G5660)} his own{G2398} which{G3588} were in{G1722} the world{G2889}, he loved{G25}{(G5656)} them{G846} unto{G1519} the end{G5056}."
John,13,2,"And{G2532} supper{G1173} being ended{G1096}{(G5637)}, the devil{G1228} having now{G2235} put{G906}{(G5761)} into{G1519} the heart{G2588} of Judas{G2455} Iscariot{G2469}, Simon's{G4613} son, to{G2443} betray{G3860}{(G5632)} him{G846};"
John,13,3,"Jesus{G2424} knowing{G1492}{(G5761)} that{G3754} the Father{G3962} had given{G1325}{(G5758)} all things{G3956} into{G1519} his{G846} hands{G5495}, and{G2532} that{G3754} he was come{G1831}{(G5627)} from{G575} God{G2316}, and{G2532} went{G5217}{(G5719)} to{G4314} God{G2316};"
John,13,4,"He riseth{G1453}{(G5743)} from{G1537} supper{G1173}, and{G2532} laid aside{G5087}{(G5719)} his garments{G2440}; and{G2532} took{G2983}{(G5631)} a towel{G3012}, and girded{G1241}{(G5656)} himself{G1438}."
John,13,5,"After that{G1534} he poureth{G906}{(G5719)} water{G5204} into{G1519} a bason{G3537}, and{G2532} began{G756}{(G5662)} to wash{G3538}{(G5721)} the disciples{G3101}' feet{G4228}, and{G2532} to wipe{G1591}{(G5721)} them with the towel{G3012} wherewith{G3739} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} girded{G1241}{(G5772)}."
John,13,6,"Then{G3767} cometh he{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G4314} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074}: and{G2532} Peter{G1565} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, dost{G3538} thou{G4771} wash{G3538}{(G5719)} my{G3450} feet{G4228}?"
John,13,7,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, What{G3739} I{G1473} do{G4160}{(G5719)} thou{G4771} knowest{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} now{G737}; but{G1161} thou shalt know{G1097}{(G5695)} hereafter{G3326}{G5023}."

Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, If{G3362} I wash{G3538}{(G5661)} thee{G4571} not{G3362}, thou hast{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} part{G3313} with{G3326} me{G1700}."

John,13,18,"I speak{G3004}{(G5719)} not{G3756} of{G4012} you{G5216} all{G3956}: I{G1473} know{G1492}{(G5758)} whom{G3739} I have chosen{G1586}{(G5668)}: but{G235} that{G2443} the scripture{G1124} may be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}, He that eateth{G5176}{(G5723)} bread{G740} with{G3326} me{G1700} hath lifted up{G1869}{(G5656)} his{G846} heel{G4418} against{G1909} me{G1691}."
John,13,19,"Now{G575}{G737} I tell{G3004}{(G5719)} you{G5213} before{G4253} it come{G1096}{(G5635)}, that{G2443}, when{G3752} it is come to pass{G1096}{(G5638)}, ye may believe{G4100}{(G5661)} that{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he."
John,13,20,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, He that receiveth{G2983}{(G5723)} whomsoever{G1437}{G5100} I send{G3992}{(G5661)} receiveth{G2983}{(G5719)} me{G1691}; and{G1161} he that receiveth{G2983}{(G5723)} me{G1691} receiveth{G2983}{(G5719)} him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,13,21,"When Jesus{G2424} had{G2036} thus{G5023} said{G2036}{(G5631)}, he was troubled{G5015}{(G5681)} in spirit{G4151}, and{G2532} testified{G3140}{(G5656)}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, that{G3754} one{G1520} of{G1537} you{G5216} shall betray{G3860}{(G5692)} me{G3165}."
John,13,22,"Then{G3767} the disciples{G3101} looked{G991}{(G5707)} one on another{G1519}{G240}, doubting{G639}{(G5734)} of{G4012} whom{G5101} he spake{G3004}{(G5719)}."
John,13,23,"Now{G1161} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} leaning{G345}{(G5740)} on{G1722} Jesus{G2424}' bosom{G2859} one{G1520} of his{G846} disciples{G3101}, whom{G3739} Jesus{G2424} loved{G25}{(G5707)}."
John,13,24,"Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} therefore{G3767} beckoned{G3506}{(G5719)} to him{G5129}, that he should ask{G4441}{(G5635)} who{G5101} it should{G302} be{G1498}{(G5751)} of{G4012} whom{G3739} he spake{G3004}{(G5719)}."
John,13,25,"He{G1565} then{G1161} lying on{G1968}{(G5631)}{G1909} Jesus{G2424}' breast{G4738} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, who{G5101} is it{G2076}{(G5748)}?"
John,13,26,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5736)}, He{G1565} it is{G2076}{(G5748)}, to whom{G3739} I shall give{G1929}{(G5692)} a sop{G5596}, when I{G1473} have dipped{G911}{(G5660)} it. And{G2532} when he had dipped{G1686}{(G5660)} the sop{G5596}, he gave{G1325}{(G5719)} it to Judas{G2455} Iscariot{G2469}, the son of Simon{G4613}."
John,13,27,"And{G2532} after{G3326} the sop{G5596}{G5119} Satan{G4567} entered{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} him{G1565}. Then{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424} unto him{G846}, That{G3739} thou doest{G4160}{(G5719)}, do{G4160}{(G5657)} quickly{G5032}."
John,13,28,Now{G1161} no man{G3762} at the table{G345}{(G5740)} knew{G1097}{(G5627)} for what{G4314} intent{G5101} he spake{G2036}{(G5627)} this{G5124} unto him{G846}.
John,13,29,"For{G1063} some{G5100} of them thought{G1380}{(G5707)}, because{G1893} Judas{G2455} had{G2192}{(G5707)} the bag{G1101}, that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} had said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Buy{G59}{(G5657)} those things that{G3739} we have{G2192}{(G5719)} need of{G5532} against{G1519} the feast{G1859}; or{G2228}, that{G2443} he should give{G1325}{(G5632)} something{G5100} to the poor{G4434}."
John,13,30,He{G1565} then{G3767} having received{G2983}{(G5631)} the sop{G5596} went{G1831} immediately{G2112} out{G1831}{(G5627)}: and{G1161} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} night{G3571}.
John,13,31,"Therefore{G3767}, when{G3753} he was gone out{G1831}{(G5627)}, Jesus{G2424} said{G3004}{(G5719)}, Now{G3568} is{G1392} the Son{G5207} of man{G444} glorified{G1392}{(G5681)}, and{G2532} God{G2316} is glorified{G1392}{(G5681)} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,13,32,"If{G1487} God{G2316} be glorified{G1392}{(G5681)} in{G1722} him{G846}, God{G2316} shall{G1392} also{G2532} glorify{G1392}{(G5692)} him{G846} in{G1722} himself{G1438}, and{G2532} shall{G1392} straightway{G2117} glorify{G1392}{(G5692)} him{G846}."
John,13,33,"Little children{G5040}, yet{G2089} a little while{G3397} I am{G1510}{(G5748)} with{G3326} you{G5216}. Ye shall seek{G2212}{(G5692)} me{G3165}: and{G2532} as{G2531} I said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto the Jews{G2453},{G3754} Whither{G3699} I{G1473} go{G5217}{(G5719)}, ye{G5210} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} come{G2064}{(G5629)}; so{G2532} now{G737} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} to you{G5213}."
John,13,34,"A new{G2537} commandment{G1785} I give{G1325}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G2443} ye love{G25}{(G5725)} one another{G240}; as{G2531} I have loved{G25}{(G5656)} you{G5209}, that{G2443} ye{G5210} also{G2532} love{G25}{(G5725)} one another{G240}."
John,13,35,"By{G1722} this{G5129} shall{G1097} all{G3956} men know{G1097}{(G5695)} that{G3754} ye are{G2075}{(G5748)} my{G1699} disciples{G3101}, if{G1437} ye have{G2192}{(G5725)} love{G26} one to another{G1722}{G240}."
John,13,36,"Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, whither{G4226} goest{G5217}{(G5719)} thou? Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, Whither{G3699} I go{G5217}{(G5719)}, thou canst{G1410}{(G5736)} not{G3756} follow{G190}{(G5658)} me{G3427} now{G3568}; but{G1161} thou shalt follow{G190}{(G5692)} me{G3427} afterwards{G5305}."
John,13,37,"Peter{G4074} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, why{G1302} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} I follow{G190}{(G5658)} thee{G4671} now{G737}? I will lay down{G5087}{(G5692)} my{G3450} life{G5590} for{G5228} thy sake{G4675}."
John,13,38,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, Wilt thou lay down{G5087}{(G5692)} thy{G4675} life{G5590} for{G5228} my sake{G1700}? Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, The cock{G220} shall{G5455} not{G3364} crow{G5455}{(G5692)}, till{G2193}{G3739} thou hast denied{G533}{(G5695)} me{G3165} thrice{G5151}."
John,14,1,"Let{G5015} not{G3361} your{G5216} heart{G2588} be troubled{G5015}{(G5744)}: ye believe{G4100}{(G5719)}{(G5720)} in{G1519} God{G2316}, believe{G4100}{(G5719)}{(G5720)} also{G2532} in{G1519} me{G1691}."
John,14,2,"In{G1722} my{G3450} Father's{G3962} house{G3614} are{G1526}{(G5748)} many{G4183} mansions{G3438}: if it were not{G1490} so, I would have told{G302}{G2036}{(G5627)} you{G5213}. I go{G4198}{(G5736)} to prepare{G2090}{(G5658)} a place{G5117} for you{G5213}."

John,14,27,"Peace{G1515} I leave{G863}{(G5719)} with you{G5213}, my{G1699} peace{G1515} I give{G1325}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}: not{G3756} as{G2531} the world{G2889} giveth{G1325}{(G5719)}, give{G1325}{(G5719)} I{G1473} unto you{G5213}. Let{G5015} not{G3361} your{G5216} heart{G2588} be troubled{G5015}{(G5744)}, neither{G3366} let it be afraid{G1168}{(G5720)}."
John,14,28,"Ye have heard{G191}{(G5656)} how{G3754} I{G1473} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto you{G5213}, I go away{G5217}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} come{G2064}{(G5736)} again unto{G4314} you{G5209}. If{G1487} ye loved{G25}{(G5707)} me{G3165},{G302} ye would rejoice{G5463}{(G5644)}, because{G3754} I said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I go{G4198}{(G5736)} unto{G4314} the Father{G3962}: for{G3754} my{G3450} Father{G3962} is{G2076}{(G5748)} greater than{G3187} I{G3450}."
John,14,29,"And{G2532} now{G3568} I have told{G2046}{(G5758)} you{G5213} before{G4250} it come to pass{G1096}{(G5635)}, that{G2443}, when{G3752} it is come to pass{G1096}{(G5638)}, ye might believe{G4100}{(G5661)}."
John,14,30,"Hereafter{G3765} I will{G2980} not{G3765} talk{G2980}{(G5692)} much{G4183} with{G3326} you{G5216}: for{G1063} the prince{G758} of this{G5127} world{G2889} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} hath{G2192}{(G5719)}{G3756} nothing{G3762} in{G1722} me{G1698}."
John,14,31,"But{G235} that{G2443} the world{G2889} may know{G1097}{(G5632)} that{G3754} I love{G25}{(G5719)} the Father{G3962}; and{G2532} as{G2531} the Father{G3962} gave{G1781} me{G3427} commandment{G1781}{(G5662)}, even so{G3779} I do{G4160}{(G5719)}. Arise{G1453}{(G5728)}, let us go{G71}{(G5725)} hence{G1782}."
John,15,1,"I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the true{G228} vine{G288}, and{G2532} my{G3450} Father{G3962} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the husbandman{G1092}."
John,15,2,"Every{G3956} branch{G2814} in{G1722} me{G1698} that{G846} beareth{G5342}{(G5723)} not{G3361} fruit{G2590} he taketh away{G142}{(G5719)}: and{G2532} every{G3956} branch that beareth{G5342}{(G5723)} fruit{G2590}, he purgeth{G2508}{(G5719)} it{G846}, that{G2443} it may bring forth{G5342}{(G5725)} more{G4119} fruit{G2590}."
John,15,3,Now{G2235} ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} clean{G2513} through{G1223} the word{G3056} which{G3739} I have spoken{G2980}{(G5758)} unto you{G5213}.
John,15,4,"Abide{G3306}{(G5657)} in{G1722} me{G1698}, and I{G2504} in{G1722} you{G5213}. As{G2531} the branch{G2814} cannot{G3756}{G1410}{(G5736)} bear{G5342}{(G5721)} fruit{G2590} of{G575} itself{G1438}, except{G3362} it abide{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} the vine{G288}; no more{G3761}{G3779} can ye{G5210}, except{G3362} ye abide{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} me{G1698}."
John,15,5,"I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} the vine{G288}, ye{G5210} are the branches{G2814}: He that abideth{G3306}{(G5723)} in{G1722} me{G1698}, and I{G2504} in{G1722} him{G846}, the same{G3778} bringeth forth{G5342}{(G5719)} much{G4183} fruit{G2590}: for{G3754} without{G5565} me{G1700} ye can{G1410}{(G5736)} do{G4160}{(G5721)} nothing{G3756}{G3762}."
John,15,6,"If{G3362} a man{G5100} abide{G3306}{(G5661)} not{G3362} in{G1722} me{G1698}, he is cast{G906}{(G5681)} forth{G1854} as{G5613} a branch{G2814}, and{G2532} is withered{G3583}{(G5681)}; and{G2532} men gather{G4863}{(G5719)} them{G846}, and{G2532} cast{G906}{(G5719)} them into{G1519} the fire{G4442}, and{G2532} they are burned{G2545}{(G5743)}."
John,15,7,"If{G1437} ye abide{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} me{G1698}, and{G2532} my{G3450} words{G4487} abide{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} you{G5213}, ye shall ask{G154}{(G5698)} what{G3739}{G1437} ye will{G2309}{(G5725)}, and{G2532} it shall be done{G1096}{(G5695)} unto you{G5213}."
John,15,8,"Herein{G1722}{G5129} is{G1392} my{G3450} Father{G3962} glorified{G1392}{(G5681)}, that{G2443} ye bear{G5342}{(G5725)} much{G4183} fruit{G2590}; so{G2532} shall ye be{G1096}{(G5695)} my{G1699} disciples{G3101}."
John,15,9,"As{G2531} the Father{G3962} hath loved{G25}{(G5656)} me{G3165}, so{G2504} have{G25} I{G2504} loved{G25}{(G5656)} you{G5209}: continue ye{G3306}{(G5657)} in{G1722} my{G1699} love{G26}."
John,15,10,"If{G1437} ye keep{G5083}{(G5661)} my{G3450} commandments{G1785}, ye shall abide{G3306}{(G5692)} in{G1722} my{G3450} love{G26}; even as{G2531} I{G1473} have kept{G5083}{(G5758)} my{G3450} Father's{G3962} commandments{G1785}, and{G2532} abide{G3306}{(G5719)} in{G1722} his{G846} love{G26}."
John,15,11,"These things{G5023} have I spoken{G2980}{(G5758)} unto you{G5213}, that{G2443} my{G1699} joy{G5479} might remain{G3306}{(G5661)} in{G1722} you{G5213}, and{G2532} that your{G5216} joy{G5479} might be full{G4137}{(G5686)}."
John,15,12,"This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} my{G1699} commandment{G1785}, That{G2443} ye love{G25}{(G5725)} one another{G240}, as{G2531} I have loved{G25}{(G5656)} you{G5209}."
John,15,13,"Greater{G3187} love{G26} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} no man{G3762} than{G3187} this{G5026}, that{G2443} a man{G5100} lay down{G5087}{(G5632)} his{G846} life{G5590} for{G5228} his{G846} friends{G5384}."
John,15,14,"Ye{G5210} are{G2075}{(G5748)} my{G3450} friends{G5384}, if{G1437} ye do{G4160}{(G5725)} whatsoever{G3745} I{G1473} command{G1781}{(G5736)} you{G5213}."
John,15,15,Henceforth{G3765} I call{G3004}{(G5719)} you{G5209} not{G3765} servants{G1401}; for{G3754} the servant{G1401} knoweth{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} what{G5101} his{G846} lord{G2962} doeth{G4160}{(G5719)}: but{G1161} I have called{G2046}{(G5758)} you{G5209} friends{G5384}; for{G3754} all things{G3956} that{G3739} I have heard{G191}{(G5656)} of{G3844} my{G3450} Father{G3962} I have made known{G1107}{(G5656)} unto you{G5213}.
John,15,16,"Ye{G5210} have{G1586} not{G3756} chosen{G1586}{(G5668)} me{G3165}, but{G235} I{G1473} have chosen{G1586}{(G5668)} you{G5209}, and{G2532} ordained{G5087}{(G5656)} you{G5209}, that{G2443} ye{G5210} should go{G5217}{(G5725)} and{G2532} bring forth{G5342}{(G5725)} fruit{G2590}, and{G2532} that your{G5216} fruit{G2590} should remain{G3306}{(G5725)}: that{G2443} whatsoever{G3739}{G302}{G3748} ye shall ask{G154}{(G5661)} of the Father{G3962} in{G1722} my{G3450} name{G3686}, he may give it{G1325}{(G5632)} you{G5213}."
John,15,17,"These things{G5023} I command{G1781}{(G5736)} you{G5213}, that{G2443} ye love{G25}{(G5725)} one another{G240}."
John,15,18,"If{G1487} the world{G2889} hate{G3404}{(G5719)} you{G5209}, ye know{G1097}{(G5719)}{(G5720)} that{G3754} it hated{G3404}{(G5758)} me{G1691} before{G4412} it hated you{G5216}."
John,15,19,"If{G1487} ye were{G2258}{(G5713)} of{G1537} the world{G2889}, the world{G2889} would{G302} love{G5368}{(G5707)} his own{G2398}: but{G1161} because{G3754} ye are{G2075}{(G5748)} not{G3756} of{G1537} the world{G2889}, but{G235} I{G1473} have chosen{G1586}{(G5668)} you{G5209} out of{G1537} the world{G2889}, therefore{G5124}{G1223} the world{G2889} hateth{G3404}{(G5719)} you{G5209}."
John,15,20,"Remember{G3421}{(G5720)} the word{G3056} that{G3739} I{G1473} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto you{G5213}, The servant{G1401} is{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} greater than{G3187} his{G846} lord{G2962}. If{G1487} they have persecuted{G1377}{(G5656)} me{G1691}, they will{G1377} also{G2532} persecute{G1377}{(G5692)} you{G5209}; if{G1487} they have kept{G5083}{(G5656)} my{G3450} saying{G3056}, they will keep{G5083}{(G5692)} yours{G5212} also{G2532}."
John,15,21,"But{G235} all{G3956} these things{G5023} will they do{G4160}{(G5692)} unto you{G5213} for{G1223} my{G3450} name's{G3686} sake{G3450}, because{G3754} they know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} him that sent{G3992}{(G5660)} me{G3165}."
John,15,22,"If{G1508} I had{G2064} not{G1508} come{G2064}{(G5627)} and{G2532} spoken{G2980}{(G5656)} unto them{G846}, they had{G2192} not{G3756} had{G2192}{(G5707)} sin{G266}: but{G1161} now{G3568} they have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} cloke{G4392} for{G4012} their{G846} sin{G266}."
John,15,23,He that hateth{G3404}{(G5723)} me{G1691} hateth{G3404}{(G5719)} my{G3450} Father{G3962} also{G2532}.
John,15,24,"If{G1508} I had{G4160} not{G1508} done{G4160}{(G5656)} among{G1722} them{G846} the works{G2041} which{G3739} none{G3762} other man{G243} did{G4160}{(G5758)}, they had{G2192} not{G3756} had{G2192}{(G5707)} sin{G266}: but{G1161} now{G3568} have they{G3708} both{G2532} seen{G3708}{(G5758)} and{G2532} hated{G3404}{(G5758)} both{G2532} me{G1691} and{G2532} my{G3450} Father{G3962}."
John,15,25,"But{G235} this cometh to pass, that{G2443} the word{G3056} might be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)} that is written{G1125}{(G5772)} in{G1722} their{G846} law{G3551},{G3754} They hated{G3404}{(G5656)} me{G3165} without a cause{G1432}."
John,15,26,"But{G1161} when{G3752} the Comforter{G3875} is come{G2064}{(G5632)}, whom{G3739} I{G1473} will send{G3992}{(G5692)} unto you{G5213} from{G3844} the Father{G3962}, even the Spirit{G4151} of truth{G225}, which{G3739} proceedeth{G1607}{(G5736)} from{G3844} the Father{G3962}, he{G1565} shall testify{G3140}{(G5692)} of{G4012} me{G1700}:"
John,15,27,"And{G1161} ye{G5210} also{G2532} shall bear witness{G3140}{(G5719)}, because{G3754} ye have been{G2075}{(G5748)} with{G3326} me{G1700} from{G575} the beginning{G746}."

John,16,3,"And{G2532} these things{G5023} will they do{G4160}{(G5692)} unto you{G5213}, because{G3754} they have{G1097} not{G3756} known{G1097}{(G5627)} the Father{G3962}, nor{G3761} me{G1691}."
John,16,4,"But{G235} these things{G5023} have I told{G2980}{(G5758)} you{G5213}, that{G2443} when{G3752} the time{G5610} shall come{G2064}{(G5632)}, ye may remember{G3421}{(G5725)} that{G3754} I{G1473} told{G2036}{(G5627)} you{G5213} of them{G846}. And{G1161} these things{G5023} I said{G2036}{(G5627)} not{G3756} unto you{G5213} at{G1537} the beginning{G746}, because{G3754} I was{G2252}{(G5713)} with{G3326} you{G5216}."

John,16,13,"Howbeit{G1161} when{G3752} he{G1565}, the Spirit{G4151} of truth{G225}, is come{G2064}{(G5632)}, he will guide{G3594}{(G5692)} you{G5209} into{G1519} all{G3956} truth{G225}: for{G1063} he shall{G2980} not{G3756} speak{G2980}{(G5692)} of{G575} himself{G1438}; but{G235} whatsoever{G3745}{G302} he shall hear{G191}{(G5661)}, that shall he speak{G2980}{(G5692)}: and{G2532} he will shew{G312}{(G5692)} you{G5213} things to come{G2064}{(G5740)}."
John,16,14,"He{G1565} shall glorify{G1392}{(G5692)} me{G1691}: for{G3754} he shall receive{G2983}{(G5695)} of{G1537} mine{G1699}, and{G2532} shall shew{G312}{(G5692)} it unto you{G5213}."
John,16,15,"All things{G3956} that{G3745} the Father{G3962} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} are{G2076}{(G5748)} mine{G1699}: therefore{G5124}{G1223} said I{G2036}{(G5627)}, that{G3754} he shall take{G2983}{(G5695)} of{G1537} mine{G1699}, and{G2532} shall shew{G312}{(G5692)} it unto you{G5213}."
John,16,16,"A little while{G3397}, and{G2532} ye shall{G2334} not{G3756} see{G2334}{(G5719)} me{G3165}: and{G2532} again{G3825}, a little while{G3397}, and{G2532} ye shall see{G3700}{(G5695)} me{G3165}, because{G3754} I{G1473} go{G5217}{(G5719)} to{G4314} the Father{G3962}."
John,16,17,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} some of{G1537} his{G846} disciples{G3101} among{G4314} themselves{G240}, What{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G5124} that{G3739} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto us{G2254}, A little while{G3397}, and{G2532} ye shall{G2334} not{G3756} see{G2334}{(G5719)} me{G3165}: and{G2532} again{G3825}, a little while{G3397}, and{G2532} ye shall see{G3700}{(G5695)} me{G3165}: and{G2532}, Because{G3754} I{G1473} go{G5217}{(G5719)} to{G4314} the Father{G3962}?"
John,16,18,"They said{G3004}{(G5707)} therefore{G3767}, What{G5101} is{G2076}{(G5748)} this{G5124} that{G3739} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, A little while{G3397}? we cannot{G3756}{G1492} tell{G1492}{(G5758)} what{G5101} he saith{G2980}{(G5719)}."
John,16,19,"Now{G3767} Jesus{G2424} knew{G1097}{(G5627)} that{G3754} they were desirous{G2309}{(G5707)} to ask{G2065}{(G5721)} him{G846}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Do ye enquire{G2212}{(G5719)} among{G3326} yourselves{G240} of{G4012} that{G5127}{G3754} I said{G2036}{(G5627)}, A little while{G3397}, and{G2532} ye shall{G2334} not{G3756} see{G2334}{(G5719)} me{G3165}: and{G2532} again{G3825}, a little while{G3397}, and{G2532} ye shall see{G3700}{(G5695)} me{G3165}?"
John,16,20,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213}, That{G3754} ye{G5210} shall weep{G2799}{(G5692)} and{G2532} lament{G2354}{(G5692)}, but{G1161} the world{G2889} shall rejoice{G5463}{(G5690)}: and{G1161} ye{G5210} shall be sorrowful{G3076}{(G5701)}, but{G235} your{G5216} sorrow{G3077} shall be turned{G1096}{(G5695)} into{G1519} joy{G5479}."
John,16,21,"A woman{G1135} when{G3752} she is in travail{G5088}{(G5725)} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} sorrow{G3077}, because{G3754} her{G846} hour{G5610} is come{G2064}{(G5627)}: but{G1161} as soon as{G3752} she is delivered{G1080}{(G5661)} of the child{G3813}, she remembereth{G3421}{(G5719)} no more{G3765} the anguish{G2347}, for{G1223} joy{G5479} that{G3754} a man{G444} is born{G1080}{(G5681)} into{G1519} the world{G2889}."
John,16,22,"And{G2532} ye{G5210}{G3303} now{G3568} therefore{G3767} have{G2192}{(G5719)} sorrow{G3077}: but{G1161} I will see{G3700}{(G5695)} you{G5209} again{G3825}, and{G2532} your{G5216} heart{G2588} shall rejoice{G5463}{(G5690)}, and{G2532} your{G5216} joy{G5479} no man{G3762} taketh{G142}{(G5719)} from{G575} you{G5216}."
John,16,23,"And{G2532} in{G1722} that{G1565} day{G2250} ye shall{G3756} ask{G2065}{(G5692)} me{G1691} nothing{G3762}. Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto you{G5213},{G3754} Whatsoever{G3745}{G302} ye shall ask{G154}{(G5661)} the Father{G3962} in{G1722} my{G3450} name{G3686}, he will give{G1325}{(G5692)} it you{G5213}."
John,16,24,"Hitherto{G2193}{G737} have ye asked{G154}{(G5656)} nothing{G3756}{G3762} in{G1722} my{G3450} name{G3686}: ask{G154}{(G5720)}, and{G2532} ye shall receive{G2983}{(G5695)}, that{G2443} your{G5216} joy{G5479} may be{G5600}{(G5753)} full{G4137}{(G5772)}."
John,16,25,"These things{G5023} have I spoken{G2980}{(G5758)} unto you{G5213} in{G1722} proverbs{G3942}: but{G235} the time{G5610} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, when{G3753} I shall{G2980} no more{G3765} speak{G2980}{(G5692)} unto you{G5213} in{G1722} proverbs{G3942}, but{G235} I shall shew{G312}{(G5692)} you{G5213} plainly{G3954} of{G4012} the Father{G3962}."
John,16,26,"At{G1722} that{G1565} day{G2250} ye shall ask{G154}{(G5698)} in{G1722} my{G3450} name{G3686}: and{G2532} I say{G3004}{(G5719)} not{G3756} unto you{G5213}, that{G3754} I{G1473} will pray{G2065}{(G5692)} the Father{G3962} for{G4012} you{G5216}:"
John,16,27,"For{G1063} the Father{G3962} himself{G846} loveth{G5368}{(G5719)} you{G5209}, because{G3754} ye{G5210} have loved{G5368}{(G5758)} me{G1691}, and{G2532} have believed{G4100}{(G5758)} that{G3754} I{G1473} came out{G1831}{(G5627)} from{G3844} God{G2316}."
John,16,28,"I came forth{G1831}{(G5627)} from{G3844} the Father{G3962}, and{G2532} am come{G2064}{(G5754)} into{G1519} the world{G2889}: again{G3825}, I leave{G863}{(G5719)} the world{G2889}, and{G2532} go{G4198}{(G5736)} to{G4314} the Father{G3962}."
John,16,29,"His{G846} disciples{G3101} said{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Lo{G2396}, now{G3568} speakest thou{G2980}{(G5719)} plainly{G3954}, and{G2532} speakest{G3004}{(G5719)} no{G3762} proverb{G3942}."
John,16,30,"Now{G3568} are we sure{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} thou knowest{G1492}{(G5758)} all things{G3956}, and{G2532} needest{G5532} not{G3756}{G2192}{(G5719)} that{G2443} any man{G5100} should ask{G2065}{(G5725)} thee{G4571}: by{G1722} this{G5129} we believe{G4100}{(G5719)} that{G3754} thou camest forth{G1831}{(G5627)} from{G575} God{G2316}."
John,16,31,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} them{G846}, Do ye{G4100} now{G737} believe{G4100}{(G5719)}?"
John,16,32,"Behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, the hour{G5610} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, yea{G2532}, is{G2064} now{G3568} come{G2064}{(G5754)}, that{G2443} ye shall be scattered{G4650}{(G5686)}, every man{G1538} to{G1519} his own{G2398}, and{G2532} shall leave{G863}{(G5632)} me{G1691} alone{G3441}: and yet{G2532} I am{G1510}{(G5748)} not{G3756} alone{G3441}, because{G3754} the Father{G3962} is{G2076}{(G5748)} with{G3326} me{G1700}."
John,16,33,"These things{G5023} I have spoken{G2980}{(G5758)} unto you{G5213}, that{G2443} in{G1722} me{G1698} ye might have{G2192}{(G5725)} peace{G1515}. In{G1722} the world{G2889} ye shall have{G2192}{(G5719)}{(G5625)}{G2192}{(G5692)} tribulation{G2347}: but{G235} be of good cheer{G2293}{(G5720)}; I{G1473} have overcome{G3528}{(G5758)} the world{G2889}."
John,17,1,"These words{G5023} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} lifted up{G1869}{(G5656)} his{G846} eyes{G3788} to{G1519} heaven{G3772}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Father{G3962}, the hour{G5610} is come{G2064}{(G5754)}; glorify{G1392}{(G5657)} thy{G4675} Son{G5207}, that{G2443} thy{G4675} Son{G5207} also{G2532} may glorify{G1392}{(G5661)} thee{G4571}:"
John,17,2,"As{G2531} thou hast given{G1325}{(G5656)} him{G846} power{G1849} over all{G3956} flesh{G4561}, that{G2443} he should give{G1325}{(G5661)} eternal{G166} life{G2222} to{G3739} as many as{G3956}{G846} thou hast given{G1325}{(G5758)} him{G846}."
John,17,3,"And{G1161} this{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} life{G2222} eternal{G166}, that{G2443} they might know{G1097}{(G5725)} thee{G4571} the only{G3441} true{G228} God{G2316}, and{G2532} Jesus{G2424} Christ{G5547}, whom{G3739} thou hast sent{G649}{(G5656)}."
John,17,4,I{G1473} have glorified{G1392}{(G5656)} thee{G4571} on{G1909} the earth{G1093}: I have finished{G5048}{(G5656)} the work{G2041} which{G3739} thou gavest{G1325}{(G5758)} me{G3427} to{G2443} do{G4160}{(G5661)}.
John,17,5,"And{G2532} now{G3568}, O Father{G3962}, glorify{G1392}{(G5657)} thou{G4771} me{G3165} with{G3844} thine own self{G4572} with the glory{G1391} which{G3739} I had{G2192}{(G5707)} with{G3844} thee{G4671} before{G4253} the world{G2889} was{G1511}{(G5750)}."
John,17,6,"I have manifested{G5319}{(G5656)} thy{G4675} name{G3686} unto the men{G444} which{G3739} thou gavest{G1325}{(G5758)} me{G3427} out of{G1537} the world{G2889}: thine{G4674} they were{G2258}{(G5713)}, and{G2532} thou gavest{G1325}{(G5758)} them{G846} me{G1698}; and{G2532} they have kept{G5083}{(G5758)} thy{G4675} word{G3056}."
John,17,7,Now{G3568} they have known{G1097}{(G5758)} that{G3754} all things{G3956} whatsoever{G3745} thou hast given{G1325}{(G5758)} me{G3427} are{G2076}{(G5748)} of{G3844} thee{G4675}.

John,17,9,"I{G1473} pray{G2065}{(G5719)} for{G4012} them{G846}: I pray{G2065}{(G5719)} not{G3756} for{G4012} the world{G2889}, but{G235} for{G4012} them which{G3739} thou hast given{G1325}{(G5758)} me{G3427}; for{G3754} they are{G1526}{(G5748)} thine{G4674}."

John,17,25,"{G2532} O righteous{G1342} Father{G3962}, the world{G2889} hath{G1097} not{G3756} known{G1097}{(G5627)} thee{G4571}: but{G1161} I{G1473} have known{G1097}{(G5627)} thee{G4571}, and{G2532} these{G3778} have known{G1097}{(G5627)} that{G3754} thou{G4771} hast sent{G649}{(G5656)} me{G3165}."
John,17,26,"And{G2532} I have declared{G1107}{(G5656)} unto them{G846} thy{G4675} name{G3686}, and{G2532} will declare{G1107}{(G5692)} it: that{G2443} the love{G26} wherewith{G3739} thou hast loved{G25}{(G5656)} me{G3165} may be{G5600}{(G5753)} in{G1722} them{G846}, and I{G2504} in{G1722} them{G846}."
John,18,1,"When Jesus{G2424} had spoken{G2036}{(G5631)} these words{G5023}, he went forth{G1831}{(G5627)} with{G4862} his{G846} disciples{G3101} over{G4008} the brook{G5493} Cedron{G2748}, where{G3699} was{G2258}{(G5713)} a garden{G2779}, into{G1519} the which{G3739} he{G846} entered{G1525}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} his{G846} disciples{G3101}."
John,18,2,"And{G1161} Judas{G2455} also{G2532}, which{G3588} betrayed{G3860}{(G5723)} him{G846}, knew{G1492}{(G5715)} the place{G5117}: for{G3754} Jesus{G2424} ofttimes{G4178} resorted{G4863}{(G5681)} thither{G1563} with{G3326} his{G846} disciples{G3101}."

John,18,5,"They answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, Jesus{G2424} of Nazareth{G3480}. Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he. And{G1161} Judas{G2455} also{G2532}, which{G3588} betrayed{G3860}{(G5723)} him{G846}, stood{G2476}{(G5715)} with{G3326} them{G846}."
John,18,6,"As soon{G5613} then{G3767} as he had said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846},{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he, they went{G565}{(G5627)} backward{G1519}{G3694}, and{G2532} fell{G4098}{(G5627)} to the ground{G5476}."
John,18,7,"Then{G3767} asked he{G1905}{(G5656)} them{G846} again{G3825}, Whom{G5101} seek ye{G2212}{(G5719)}? And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Jesus{G2424} of Nazareth{G3480}."
John,18,8,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, I have told{G2036}{(G5627)} you{G5213} that{G3754} I{G1473} am{G1510}{(G5748)} he: if{G1487} therefore{G3767} ye seek{G2212}{(G5719)} me{G1691}, let{G863}{(G5628)} these{G5128} go their way{G5217}{(G5721)}:"

John,18,10,"Then{G3767} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} having{G2192}{(G5723)} a sword{G3162} drew{G1670}{(G5656)} it{G846}, and{G2532} smote{G3817}{(G5656)} the high priest's{G749} servant{G1401}, and{G2532} cut off{G609}{(G5656)} his{G846} right{G1188} ear{G5621}.{G1161} The servant's{G1401} name{G3686} was{G2258}{(G5713)} Malchus{G3124}."
John,18,11,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} unto Peter{G4074}, Put up{G906}{(G5628)} thy{G4675} sword{G3162} into{G1519} the sheath{G2336}: the cup{G4221} which{G3739} my Father{G3962} hath given{G1325}{(G5758)} me{G3427}, shall I{G4095} not{G3378} drink{G4095}{(G5632)} it{G846}?"
John,18,12,"Then{G3767} the band{G4686} and{G2532} the captain{G5506} and{G2532} officers{G5257} of the Jews{G2453} took{G4815}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} bound{G1210}{(G5656)} him{G846},"

John,18,14,"Now{G1161} Caiaphas{G2533} was he{G2258}{(G5713)}, which{G3588} gave counsel{G4823}{(G5660)} to the Jews{G2453}, that{G3754} it was expedient{G4851}{(G5719)} that one{G1520} man{G444} should die{G622}{(G5641)} for{G5228} the people{G2992}."
John,18,15,"And{G1161} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} followed{G190}{(G5707)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} so did another{G243} disciple{G3101}:{G1161} that{G1565} disciple{G3101} was{G2258}{(G5713)} known{G1110} unto the high priest{G749}, and{G2532} went in with{G4897}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} into{G1519} the palace{G833} of the high priest{G749}."
John,18,16,"But{G1161} Peter{G4074} stood{G2476}{(G5715)} at{G4314} the door{G2374} without{G1854}. Then{G3767} went out{G1831}{(G5627)} that other{G243} disciple{G3101}, which{G3739} was{G2258}{(G5713)} known{G1110} unto the high priest{G749}, and{G2532} spake{G2036}{(G5627)} unto her that kept the door{G2377}, and{G2532} brought in{G1521}{(G5627)} Peter{G4074}."
John,18,17,"Then{G3767} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} the damsel{G3814} that kept the door{G2377} unto Peter{G4074}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} not{G3361} thou{G4771} also{G2532} one of{G1537} this{G5127} man's{G444} disciples{G3101}? He{G1565} saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} not{G3756}."
John,18,18,"And{G1161} the servants{G1401} and{G2532} officers{G5257} stood there{G2476}{(G5715)}, who had made{G4160}{(G5761)} a fire of coals{G439}; for{G3754} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} cold{G5592}: and{G2532} they warmed themselves{G2328}{(G5711)}: and{G1161} Peter{G4074} stood{G2258}{(G5713)}{G2476}{(G5761)} with{G3326} them{G846}, and{G2532} warmed himself{G2328}{(G5734)}."
John,18,19,"The high priest{G749} then{G3767} asked{G2065}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} of{G4012} his{G846} disciples{G3101}, and{G2532} of{G4012} his{G846} doctrine{G1322}."
John,18,20,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, I{G1473} spake{G2980}{(G5656)} openly{G3954} to the world{G2889}; I{G1473} ever{G3842} taught{G1321}{(G5656)} in{G1722} the synagogue{G4864}, and{G2532} in{G1722} the temple{G2411}, whither{G3699} the Jews{G2453} always{G3842} resort{G4905}{(G5736)}; and{G2532} in{G1722} secret{G2927} have I said{G2980}{(G5656)} nothing{G3762}."
John,18,21,"Why{G5101} askest thou{G1905}{(G5719)} me{G3165}? ask{G1905}{(G5657)} them which heard me{G191}{(G5756)}, what{G5101} I have said{G2980}{(G5656)} unto them{G846}: behold{G2396}, they{G3778} know{G1492}{(G5758)} what{G3739} I{G1473} said{G2036}{(G5627)}."
John,18,22,"And{G1161} when he{G846} had{G2036} thus{G5023} spoken{G2036}{(G5631)}, one{G1520} of the officers{G5257} which stood by{G3936}{(G5761)} struck{G1325}{G4475} Jesus{G2424} with the palm of his hand{G1325}{(G5656)}{G4475}, saying{G2036}{(G5631)}, Answerest thou{G611}{(G5736)} the high priest{G749} so{G3779}?"
John,18,23,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, If{G1487} I have spoken{G2980}{(G5656)} evil{G2560}, bear witness{G3140}{(G5657)} of{G4012} the evil{G2556}: but{G1161} if{G1487} well{G2573}, why{G5101} smitest{G1194}{(G5719)} thou me{G3165}?"
John,18,24,Now Annas{G452} had sent{G649}{(G5656)} him{G846} bound{G1210}{(G5772)} unto{G4314} Caiaphas{G2533} the high priest{G749}.
John,18,25,"And{G1161} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} stood{G2258}{(G5713)}{G2476}{(G5761)} and{G2532} warmed himself{G2328}{(G5734)}. They said{G2036}{(G5627)} therefore{G3767} unto him{G846}, Art{G1488}{(G5748)} not{G3361} thou{G4771} also{G2532} one of{G1537} his{G846} disciples{G3101}? He{G1565} denied{G720}{(G5662)} it, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} not{G3756}."
John,18,26,"One{G1520} of{G1537} the servants{G1401} of the high priest{G749}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} his kinsman{G4773} whose{G3739} ear{G5621} Peter{G4074} cut off{G609}{(G5656)}, saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, Did{G1492} not{G3756} I{G1473} see{G1492}{(G5627)} thee{G4571} in{G1722} the garden{G2779} with{G3326} him{G846}?"
John,18,27,Peter{G4074} then{G3767} denied{G720}{(G5662)} again{G3825}: and{G2532} immediately{G2112} the cock{G220} crew{G5455}{(G5656)}.
John,18,28,"Then{G3767} led they{G71}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424} from{G575} Caiaphas{G2533} unto{G1519} the hall of judgment{G4232}: and{G1161} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} early{G4405}; and{G2532} they themselves{G846} went{G1525}{(G5627)} not{G3756} into{G1519} the judgment hall{G4232}, lest{G3363} they should be defiled{G3392}{(G5686)}; but{G235} that{G2443} they might eat{G5315}{(G5632)} the passover{G3957}."
John,18,29,"Pilate{G4091} then{G3767} went out{G1831}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} them{G846}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, What{G5101} accusation{G2724} bring ye{G5342}{(G5719)} against{G2596} this{G5127} man{G444}?"
John,18,30,"They answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, If{G1508} he{G3778} were{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G1508} a malefactor{G2555}, we would{G302} not{G3756} have delivered{G3860} him{G846} up{G3860}{(G5656)} unto thee{G4671}."
John,18,31,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Pilate{G4091} unto them{G846}, Take{G2983}{(G5628)} ye{G5210} him{G846}, and{G2532} judge{G2919}{(G5657)} him{G846} according{G2596} to your{G5216} law{G3551}. The Jews{G2453} therefore{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, It is{G1832} not{G3756} lawful{G1832}{(G5748)} for us{G2254} to put{G615} any man{G3762} to death{G615}{(G5658)}:"
John,18,32,"That{G2443} the saying{G3056} of Jesus{G2424} might be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}, which{G3739} he spake{G2036}{(G5627)}, signifying{G4591}{(G5723)} what{G4169} death{G2288} he should{G3195}{(G5707)} die{G599}{(G5721)}."

John,19,1,"Then{G5119} Pilate{G4091} therefore{G3767} took{G2983}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} scourged{G3146}{(G5656)} him."
John,19,2,"And{G2532} the soldiers{G4757} platted{G4120}{(G5660)} a crown{G4735} of{G1537} thorns{G173}, and put it on{G2007}{(G5656)} his{G846} head{G2776}, and{G2532} they put on{G4016}{(G5627)} him{G846} a purple{G4210} robe{G2440},"
John,19,3,"And{G2532} said{G3004}{(G5707)}, Hail{G5463}{(G5720)}, King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}! and{G2532} they smote{G1325}{(G5707)} him{G846} with their hands{G4475}."
John,19,4,"Pilate{G4091} therefore{G3767} went{G1831}{(G5627)} forth{G1854} again{G3825}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Behold{G2396}, I bring{G71}{(G5719)} him{G846} forth{G1854} to you{G5213}, that{G2443} ye may know{G1097}{(G5632)} that{G3754} I find{G2147}{(G5719)} no{G3762} fault{G156} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,19,5,"Then{G3767} came{G1831}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} forth{G1854}, wearing{G5409}{(G5723)} the crown{G4735} of thorns{G174}, and{G2532} the purple{G4210} robe{G2440}. And{G2532} Pilate saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Behold{G2396} the man{G444}!"
John,19,6,"When{G3753} the chief priests{G749} therefore{G3767} and{G2532} officers{G5257} saw{G1492}{(G5627)} him{G846}, they cried out{G2905}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Crucify{G4717}{(G5657)} him, crucify{G4717}{(G5657)} him. Pilate{G4091} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Take{G2983}{(G5628)} ye{G5210} him{G846}, and{G2532} crucify{G4717}{(G5657)} him: for{G1063} I{G1473} find{G2147}{(G5719)} no{G3756} fault{G156} in{G1722} him{G846}."
John,19,7,"The Jews{G2453} answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, We{G2249} have{G2192}{(G5719)} a law{G3551}, and{G2532} by{G2596} our{G2257} law{G3551} he ought{G3784}{(G5719)} to die{G599}{(G5629)}, because{G3754} he made{G4160}{(G5656)} himself{G1438} the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}."
John,19,8,"When{G3753} Pilate{G4091} therefore{G3767} heard{G191}{(G5656)} that{G5126} saying{G3056}, he was{G5399} the more{G3123} afraid{G5399}{(G5675)};"
John,19,9,"And{G2532} went{G1525}{(G5627)} again{G3825} into{G1519} the judgment hall{G4232}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto Jesus{G2424}, Whence{G4159} art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771}? But{G1161} Jesus{G2424} gave{G1325}{(G5656)} him{G846} no{G3756} answer{G612}."
John,19,10,"Then{G3767} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} Pilate{G4091} unto him{G846}, Speakest thou{G2980}{(G5719)} not{G3756} unto me{G1698}? knowest thou{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} that{G3754} I have{G2192}{(G5719)} power{G1849} to crucify{G4717}{(G5658)} thee{G4571}, and{G2532} have{G2192}{(G5719)} power{G1849} to release{G630}{(G5658)} thee{G4571}?"
John,19,11,"Jesus{G2424} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, Thou couldest have{G2192}{(G5707)} no{G3756} power{G1849} at all against{G3762}{G2596} me{G1700}, except{G1508} it were{G2258}{(G5713)} given{G1325}{(G5772)} thee{G4671} from above{G509}: therefore{G5124}{G1223} he that delivered{G3860}{(G5723)} me{G3165} unto thee{G4671} hath{G2192}{(G5719)} the greater{G3187} sin{G266}."
John,19,12,"And from{G1537} thenceforth{G5127} Pilate{G4091} sought{G2212}{(G5707)} to release{G630}{(G5658)} him{G846}: but{G1161} the Jews{G2453} cried out{G2896}{(G5707)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, If{G1437} thou let{G630} this man{G5126} go{G630}{(G5661)}, thou art{G1488}{(G5748)} not{G3756} Caesar's{G2541} friend{G5384}: whosoever{G3956} maketh{G4160}{(G5723)} himself{G846} a king{G935} speaketh against{G483}{(G5719)} Caesar{G2541}."
John,19,13,"When Pilate{G4091} therefore{G3767} heard{G191}{(G5660)} that{G5126} saying{G3056}, he brought{G71}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} forth{G1854}, and{G2532} sat down{G2523}{(G5656)} in{G1909} the judgment seat{G968} in{G1519} a place{G5117} that is called{G3004}{(G5746)} the Pavement{G3038}, but{G1161} in the Hebrew{G1447}, Gabbatha{G1042}."
John,19,14,"And{G1161} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} the preparation{G3904} of the passover{G3957}, and{G1161} about{G5616} the sixth{G1623} hour{G5610}: and{G2532} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto the Jews{G2453}, Behold{G2396} your{G5216} King{G935}!"
John,19,15,"But{G1161} they cried out{G2905}{(G5656)}, Away with{G142}{(G5657)} him, away with{G142}{(G5657)} him, crucify{G4717}{(G5657)} him{G846}. Pilate{G4091} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Shall I crucify{G4717}{(G5692)} your{G5216} King{G935}? The chief priests{G749} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, We have{G2192}{(G5719)} no{G3756} king{G935} but{G1508} Caesar{G2541}."
John,19,16,"Then{G5119} delivered he{G3860}{(G5656)} him{G846} therefore{G3767} unto them{G846} to{G2443} be crucified{G4717}{(G5686)}. And{G1161} they took{G3880}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} led him away{G520}{(G5627)}."
John,19,17,"And{G2532} he bearing{G941}{(G5723)} his{G846} cross{G4716} went forth{G1831}{(G5627)} into{G1519} a place{G5117} called{G3004}{(G5746)} the place of a skull{G2898}, which{G3739} is called{G3004}{(G5743)} in the Hebrew{G1447} Golgotha{G1115}:"
John,19,18,"Where{G3699} they crucified{G4717}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and{G2532} two{G1417} other{G243} with{G3326} him{G846}, on either side one{G2532}{G1782}{G1782}, and{G1161} Jesus{G2424} in the midst{G3319}."
John,19,19,"And{G1161}{G2532} Pilate{G4091} wrote{G1125}{(G5656)} a title{G5102}, and{G2532} put{G5087}{(G5656)} it on{G1909} the cross{G4716}. And{G1161} the writing{G1125}{(G5772)} was{G2258}{(G5713)}, JESUS{G2424} OF NAZARETH{G3480} THE KING{G935} OF THE JEWS{G2453}."
John,19,20,"This{G5126} title{G5102} then{G3767} read{G314}{(G5627)} many{G4183} of the Jews{G2453}: for{G3754} the place{G5117} where{G3699} Jesus{G2424} was crucified{G4717}{(G5681)} was{G2258}{(G5713)} nigh{G1451} to the city{G4172}: and{G2532} it was{G2258}{(G5713)} written{G1125}{(G5772)} in Hebrew{G1447}, and Greek{G1676}, and Latin{G4515}."
John,19,21,"Then{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} the chief priests{G749} of the Jews{G2453} to Pilate{G4091}, Write{G1125}{(G5720)} not{G3361}, The King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}; but{G235} that{G3754} he{G1565} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, I am{G1510}{(G5748)} King{G935} of the Jews{G2453}."
John,19,22,"Pilate{G4091} answered{G611}{(G5662)}, What{G3739} I have written{G1125}{(G5758)} I have written{G1125}{(G5758)}."
John,19,23,"Then{G3767} the soldiers{G4757}, when{G3753} they had crucified{G4717}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424}, took{G2983}{(G5627)} his{G846} garments{G2440}, and{G2532} made{G4160}{(G5656)} four{G5064} parts{G3313}, to every{G1538} soldier{G4757} a part{G3313}; and also{G2532} his coat{G5509}: now{G1161} the coat{G5509} was{G2258}{(G5713)} without seam{G729}, woven{G5307} from{G1537} the top{G509} throughout{G1223}{G3650}."
John,19,24,"They said{G2036}{(G5627)} therefore{G3767} among{G4314} themselves{G240}, Let us{G4977} not{G3361} rend{G4977}{(G5661)} it{G846}, but{G235} cast lots{G2975}{(G5632)} for{G4012} it{G846}, whose{G5101} it shall be{G2071}{(G5704)}: that{G2443} the scripture{G1124} might be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}, which{G3588} saith{G3004}{(G5723)}, They parted{G1266}{(G5668)} my{G3450} raiment{G2440} among them{G1438}, and{G2532} for{G1909} my{G3450} vesture{G2441} they did cast{G906}{(G5627)} lots{G2819}. These things{G5023}{G3303} therefore{G3767} the soldiers{G4757} did{G4160}{(G5656)}."
John,19,25,"Now{G1161} there stood{G2476}{(G5715)} by{G3844} the cross{G4716} of Jesus{G2424} his{G846} mother{G3384}, and{G2532} his{G846} mother's{G3384} sister{G79}, Mary{G3137} the wife{G3588} of Cleophas{G2832}, and{G2532} Mary{G3137} Magdalene{G3094}."
John,19,26,"When Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} saw{G1492}{(G5631)} his mother{G3384}, and{G2532} the disciple{G3101} standing by{G3936}{(G5761)}, whom{G3739} he loved{G25}{(G5707)}, he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto his{G846} mother{G3384}, Woman{G1135}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)} thy{G4675} son{G5207}!"
John,19,27,"Then{G1534} saith he{G3004}{(G5719)} to the disciple{G3101}, Behold{G2400}{(G5628)} thy{G4675} mother{G3384}! And{G2532} from{G575} that{G1565} hour{G5610} that disciple{G3101} took{G2983}{(G5627)} her{G846} unto{G1519} his own{G2398} home."
John,19,28,"After{G3326} this{G5124}, Jesus{G2424} knowing{G1492}{(G5761)} that{G3754} all things{G3956} were{G5055} now{G2235} accomplished{G5055}{(G5769)}, that{G2443} the scripture{G1124} might be fulfilled{G5048}{(G5686)}, saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, I thirst{G1372}{(G5719)}."
John,19,29,"Now{G3767} there was set{G2749}{(G5711)} a vessel{G4632} full{G3324} of vinegar{G3690}: and{G1161} they filled{G4130}{(G5660)} a spunge{G4699} with vinegar{G3690}, and{G2532} put it upon{G4060}{(G5631)} hyssop{G5301}, and put{G4374}{(G5656)} it to his{G846} mouth{G4750}."
John,19,30,"When{G3753} Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} had received{G2983}{(G5627)} the vinegar{G3690}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, It is finished{G5055}{(G5769)}: and{G2532} he bowed{G2827}{(G5660)} his head{G2776}, and gave up{G3860}{(G5656)} the ghost{G4151}."
John,19,31,"The Jews{G2453} therefore{G3767}, because{G1893} it was{G2258}{(G5713)}{(G5625)}{G2258}{(G5713)} the preparation{G3904}, that{G3363} the bodies{G4983} should{G3306} not{G3363} remain{G3306}{(G5661)} upon{G1909} the cross{G4716} on{G1722} the sabbath day{G4521},(for{G1063} that{G1565} sabbath day{G4521} was{G2258}{(G5713)} an high{G3173} day{G2250},) besought{G2065}{(G5656)} Pilate{G4091} that{G2443} their{G846} legs{G4628} might be broken{G2608}{(G5652)}, and{G2532} that they might be taken away{G142}{(G5686)}."
John,19,32,"Then{G3767} came{G2064}{(G5627)} the soldiers{G4757}, and{G2532} brake{G2608}{(G5656)} the legs{G4628} of the{G3303} first{G4413}, and{G2532} of the other{G243} which{G3588} was crucified with{G4957}{(G5685)} him{G846}."
John,19,33,"But{G1161} when{G5613} they came{G2064}{(G5631)} to{G1909} Jesus{G2424}, and saw{G1492}{(G5627)} that he{G846} was dead{G2348}{(G5761)} already{G2235}, they brake{G2608}{(G5656)} not{G3756} his{G846} legs{G4628}:"
John,19,34,"But{G235} one{G1520} of the soldiers{G4757} with a spear{G3057} pierced{G3572}{(G5656)} his{G846} side{G4125}, and{G2532} forthwith{G2117} came there out{G1831}{(G5627)} blood{G129} and{G2532} water{G5204}."
John,19,35,"And{G2532} he that saw{G3708}{(G5761)} it bare record{G3140}{(G5758)}, and{G2532} his{G846} record{G3141} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G228}: and he{G2548} knoweth{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} true{G227}, that{G2443} ye{G5210} might believe{G4100}{(G5661)}."
John,19,36,"For{G1063} these things{G5023} were done{G1096}{(G5633)}, that{G2443} the scripture{G1124} should be fulfilled{G4137}{(G5686)}, A bone{G3747} of him{G846} shall{G4937} not{G3756} be broken{G4937}{(G5691)}."
John,19,37,"And{G2532} again{G3825} another{G2087} scripture{G1124} saith{G3004}{(G5719)}, They shall look{G3700}{(G5695)} on{G1519} him whom{G3739} they pierced{G1574}{(G5656)}."
John,19,38,"And{G1161} after{G3326} this{G5023} Joseph{G2501} of{G575} Arimathaea{G707}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} a disciple{G3101} of Jesus{G2424}, but{G1161} secretly{G2928}{(G5772)} for{G1223} fear{G5401} of the Jews{G2453}, besought{G2065}{(G5656)} Pilate{G4091} that{G2443} he might take away{G142}{(G5661)} the body{G4983} of Jesus{G2424}: and{G2532} Pilate{G4091} gave him leave{G2010}{(G5656)}. He came{G2064}{(G5627)} therefore{G3767}, and{G2532} took{G142}{(G5656)} the body{G4983} of Jesus{G2424}."
John,19,39,"And{G1161} there came{G2064}{(G5627)} also{G2532} Nicodemus{G3530}, which{G3588} at the first{G4412} came{G2064}{(G5631)} to{G4314} Jesus{G2424} by night{G3571}, and brought{G5342}{(G5723)} a mixture{G3395} of myrrh{G4666} and{G2532} aloes{G250}, about{G5616} an hundred{G1540} pound{G3046} weight."
John,19,40,"Then{G3767} took they{G2983}{(G5627)} the body{G4983} of Jesus{G2424}, and{G2532} wound{G1210}{(G5656)} it{G846} in linen clothes{G3608} with{G3326} the spices{G759}, as{G2531} the manner{G1485} of the Jews{G2453} is{G2076}{(G5748)} to bury{G1779}{(G5721)}."
John,19,41,"Now{G1161} in{G1722} the place{G5117} where{G3699} he was crucified{G4717}{(G5681)} there was{G2258}{(G5713)} a garden{G2779}; and{G2532} in{G1722} the garden{G2779} a new{G2537} sepulchre{G3419}, wherein{G1722}{G3739} was{G5087} never{G3764} man{G3762} yet{G3764} laid{G5087}{(G5681)}."
John,19,42,There{G1563} laid they{G5087}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} therefore{G3767} because{G1223} of the Jews{G2453}' preparation{G3904} day; for{G3754} the sepulchre{G3419} was{G2258}{(G5713)} nigh at hand{G1451}.
John,20,1,"{G1161} The first{G3391} day of the week{G4521} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} Mary{G3137} Magdalene{G3094} early{G4404}, when it was{G5607}{(G5752)} yet{G2089} dark{G4653}, unto{G1519} the sepulchre{G3419}, and{G2532} seeth{G991}{(G5719)} the stone{G3037} taken away{G142}{(G5772)} from{G1537} the sepulchre{G3419}."
John,20,2,"Then{G3767} she runneth{G5143}{(G5719)}, and{G2532} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} to{G4314} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} to{G4314} the other{G243} disciple{G3101}, whom{G3739} Jesus{G2424} loved{G5368}{(G5707)}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, They have taken away{G142}{(G5656)} the Lord{G2962} out of{G1537} the sepulchre{G3419}, and{G2532} we know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} where{G4226} they have laid{G5087}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
John,20,3,"Peter{G4074} therefore{G3767} went forth{G1831}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} that other{G243} disciple{G3101}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5711)} to{G1519} the sepulchre{G3419}."
John,20,4,"So{G1161} they ran{G5143}{(G5707)} both{G1417} together{G3674}: and{G2532} the other{G243} disciple{G3101} did outrun{G4390}{(G5627)}{G5032} Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} came{G2064}{(G5627)} first{G4413} to{G1519} the sepulchre{G3419}."
John,20,5,"And{G2532} he stooping down{G3879}{(G5660)}, and looking in, saw{G991}{(G5719)} the linen clothes{G3608} lying{G2749}{(G5740)}; yet{G3305} went he{G1525} not{G3756} in{G1525}{(G5627)}."
John,20,6,"Then{G3767} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} following{G190}{(G5723)} him{G846}, and{G2532} went{G1525}{(G5627)} into{G1519} the sepulchre{G3419}, and{G2532} seeth{G2334}{(G5719)} the linen clothes{G3608} lie{G2749}{(G5740)},"
John,20,7,"And{G2532} the napkin{G4676}, that{G3739} was{G2258}{(G5713)} about{G1909} his{G846} head{G2776}, not{G3756} lying{G2749}{(G5740)} with{G3326} the linen clothes{G3608}, but{G235} wrapped together{G1794}{(G5772)} in{G1519} a place{G5117} by itself{G1520}{G5565}."
John,20,8,"Then{G5119}{G3767} went in{G1525}{(G5627)} also{G2532} that other{G243} disciple{G3101}, which{G3588} came{G2064}{(G5631)} first{G4413} to{G1519} the sepulchre{G3419}, and{G2532} he saw{G1492}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} believed{G4100}{(G5656)}."
John,20,9,"For{G1063} as yet{G3764} they knew{G1492}{(G5715)} not{G3764} the scripture{G1124}, that{G3754} he{G846} must{G1163}{(G5748)} rise again{G450}{(G5629)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}."
John,20,10,Then{G3767} the disciples{G3101} went away{G565}{(G5627)} again{G3825} unto{G4314} their own home{G1438}.
John,20,11,"But{G1161} Mary{G3137} stood{G2476}{(G5715)} without{G1854} at{G4314} the sepulchre{G3419} weeping{G2799}{(G5723)}: and{G3767} as{G5613} she wept{G2799}{(G5707)}, she stooped down{G3879}{(G5656)}, and looked into{G1519} the sepulchre{G3419},"
John,20,12,"And{G2532} seeth{G2334}{(G5719)} two{G1417} angels{G32} in{G1722} white{G3022} sitting{G2516}{(G5740)}, the one{G1520} at{G4314} the head{G2776}, and{G2532} the other{G1520} at{G4314} the feet{G4228}, where{G3699} the body{G4983} of Jesus{G2424} had lain{G2749}{(G5711)}."
John,20,13,"And{G2532} they{G1565} say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Woman{G1135}, why{G5101} weepest thou{G2799}{(G5719)}? She saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Because{G3754} they have taken away{G142}{(G5656)} my{G3450} Lord{G2962}, and{G2532} I know{G1492}{(G5758)} not{G3756} where{G4226} they have laid{G5087}{(G5656)} him{G846}."
John,20,14,"And{G2532} when she had{G2036} thus{G5023} said{G2036}{(G5631)}, she turned{G4762}{(G5648)} herself{G1519} back{G3694}, and{G2532} saw{G2334}{(G5719)} Jesus{G2424} standing{G2476}{(G5761)}, and{G2532} knew{G1492}{(G5715)} not{G3756} that{G3754} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} Jesus{G2424}."
John,20,15,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Woman{G1135}, why{G5101} weepest thou{G2799}{(G5719)}? whom{G5101} seekest thou{G2212}{(G5719)}? She{G1565}, supposing{G1380}{(G5723)}{G3754} him to be{G2076}{(G5748)} the gardener{G2780}, saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Sir{G2962}, if{G1487} thou{G4771} have borne{G941} him{G846} hence{G941}{(G5656)}, tell{G2036}{(G5628)} me{G3427} where{G4226} thou hast laid{G5087}{(G5656)} him{G846}, and I{G2504} will take{G142} him{G846} away{G142}{(G5692)}."
John,20,16,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Mary{G3137}. She{G1565} turned{G4762}{(G5651)} herself, and saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Rabboni{G4462}; which{G3739} is to say{G3004}{(G5743)}, Master{G1320}."
John,20,17,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto her{G846}, Touch{G680}{(G5732)} me{G3450} not{G3361}; for{G1063} I am{G305} not yet{G3768} ascended{G305}{(G5758)} to{G4314} my{G3450} Father{G3962}: but{G1161} go{G4198}{(G5737)} to{G4314} my{G3450} brethren{G80}, and{G2532} say{G2036}{(G5628)} unto them{G846}, I ascend{G305}{(G5719)} unto{G4314} my{G3450} Father{G3962}, and{G2532} your{G5216} Father{G3962}; and{G2532} to my{G3450} God{G2316}, and{G2532} your{G5216} God{G2316}."
John,20,18,"Mary{G3137} Magdalene{G3094} came{G2064}{(G5736)} and told{G518}{(G5723)} the disciples{G3101} that{G3754} she had seen{G3708}{(G5758)} the Lord{G2962}, and{G2532} that he had spoken{G2036}{(G5627)} these things{G5023} unto her{G846}."
John,20,19,"Then{G3767} the same{G1565} day{G2250} at evening{G3798}, being{G5607}{(G5752)} the first{G3391} day of the week{G4521}, when{G2532} the doors{G2374} were shut{G2808}{(G5772)} where{G3699} the disciples{G3101} were{G2258}{(G5713)} assembled{G4863}{(G5772)} for{G1223} fear{G5401} of the Jews{G2453}, came{G2064}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} and{G2532} stood{G2476}{(G5627)} in{G1519} the midst{G3319}, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Peace{G1515} be unto you{G5213}."
John,20,20,"And{G2532} when he had{G2036} so{G5124} said{G2036}{(G5631)}, he shewed{G1166}{(G5656)} unto them{G846} his hands{G5495} and{G2532} his{G846} side{G4125}. Then{G3767} were{G5463} the disciples{G3101} glad{G5463}{(G5644)}, when they saw{G1492}{(G5631)} the Lord{G2962}."
John,20,21,"Then{G3767} said{G2036}{(G5627)} Jesus{G2424} to them{G846} again{G3825}, Peace{G1515} be unto you{G5213}: as{G2531} my Father{G3962} hath sent{G649}{(G5758)} me{G3165}, even so{G2504} send{G3992}{(G5719)} I{G2504} you{G5209}."
John,20,22,"And{G2532} when he had said{G2036}{(G5631)} this{G5124}, he breathed on{G1720}{(G5656)} them, and{G2532} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Receive ye{G2983}{(G5628)} the Holy{G40} Ghost{G4151}:"
John,20,23,"Whose{G5100} soever{G302} sins{G266} ye remit{G863}{(G5632)}, they are remitted{G863}{(G5743)} unto them{G846}; and whose{G5100} soever{G302} sins ye retain{G2902}{(G5725)}, they are retained{G2902}{(G5769)}."
John,20,24,"But{G1161} Thomas{G2381}, one{G1520} of{G1537} the twelve{G1427}, called{G3004}{(G5746)} Didymus{G1324}, was{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G3756} with{G3326} them{G846} when{G3753} Jesus{G2424} came{G2064}{(G5627)}."
John,20,25,"The other{G243} disciples{G3101} therefore{G3767} said{G3004}{(G5707)} unto him{G846}, We have seen{G3708}{(G5758)} the Lord{G2962}. But{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Except{G3362} I shall see{G1492}{(G5632)} in{G1722} his{G846} hands{G5495} the print{G5179} of the nails{G2247}, and{G2532} put{G906}{(G5632)} my{G3450} finger{G1147} into{G1519} the print{G5179} of the nails{G2247}, and{G2532} thrust{G906}{(G5632)} my{G3450} hand{G5495} into{G1519} his{G846} side{G4125}, I will{G4100} not{G3364} believe{G4100}{(G5692)}."
John,20,26,"And{G2532} after{G3326} eight{G3638} days{G2250} again{G3825} his{G846} disciples{G3101} were{G2258}{(G5713)} within{G2080}, and{G2532} Thomas{G2381} with{G3326} them{G846}: then came{G2064}{(G5736)} Jesus{G2424}, the doors{G2374} being shut{G2808}{(G5772)}, and{G2532} stood{G2476}{(G5627)} in{G1519} the midst{G3319}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Peace{G1515} be unto you{G5213}."
John,20,27,"Then{G1534} saith he{G3004}{(G5719)} to Thomas{G2381}, Reach{G5342}{(G5720)} hither{G5602} thy{G4675} finger{G1147}, and{G2532} behold{G1492}{(G5657)} my{G3450} hands{G5495}; and{G2532} reach hither{G5342}{(G5720)} thy{G4675} hand{G5495}, and{G2532} thrust{G906}{(G5628)} it into{G1519} my{G3450} side{G4125}: and{G2532} be{G1096}{(G5737)} not{G3361} faithless{G571}, but{G235} believing{G4103}."
John,20,28,"And{G2532} Thomas{G2381} answered{G611}{(G5662)} and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, My{G3450} Lord{G2962} and{G2532} my{G3450} God{G2316}."
John,20,29,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Thomas{G2381}, because{G3754} thou hast seen{G3708}{(G5758)} me{G3165}, thou hast believed{G4100}{(G5758)}: blessed{G3107} are they that have not{G3361} seen{G1492}{(G5631)}, and{G2532} yet have believed{G4100}{(G5660)}."
John,20,30,"And{G2532} many{G4183} other{G243} signs{G4592} truly{G3303}{G3767} did{G4160}{(G5656)} Jesus{G2424} in the presence{G1799} of his{G846} disciples{G3101}, which{G3739} are{G2076}{(G5748)} not{G3756} written{G1125}{(G5772)} in{G1722} this{G5129} book{G975}:"
John,20,31,"But{G1161} these{G5023} are written{G1125}{(G5769)}, that{G2443} ye might believe{G4100}{(G5661)} that{G3754} Jesus{G2424} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the Christ{G5547}, the Son{G5207} of God{G2316}; and{G2532} that{G2443} believing{G4100}{(G5723)} ye might have{G2192}{(G5725)} life{G2222} through{G1722} his{G846} name{G3686}."
John,21,1,After{G3326} these things{G5023} Jesus{G2424} shewed{G5319}{(G5656)} himself{G1438} again{G3825} to the disciples{G3101} at{G1909} the sea{G2281} of Tiberias{G5085}; and{G1161} on this wise{G3779} shewed{G5319}{(G5656)} he himself.
John,21,2,"There were{G2258}{(G5713)} together{G3674} Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074}, and{G2532} Thomas{G2381} called{G3004}{(G5746)} Didymus{G1324}, and{G2532} Nathanael{G3482} of{G575} Cana{G2580} in Galilee{G1056}, and{G2532} the sons{G3588} of Zebedee{G2199}, and{G2532} two{G1417} other{G243} of{G1537} his{G846} disciples{G3101}."
John,21,3,"Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, I go{G5217}{(G5719)} a fishing{G232}{(G5721)}. They say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, We{G2249} also{G2532} go{G2064}{(G5736)} with{G4862} thee{G4671}. They went forth{G1831}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} entered{G305}{(G5627)} into{G1519} a ship{G4143} immediately{G2117}; and{G2532} that{G1722}{G1565} night{G3571} they caught{G4084}{(G5656)} nothing{G3762}."
John,21,4,"But{G1161} when the morning{G4405} was{G1096} now{G2235} come{G1096}{(G5637)}, Jesus{G2424} stood{G2476}{(G5627)} on{G1519} the shore{G123}: but{G3305} the disciples{G3101} knew{G1492}{(G5715)} not{G3756} that{G3754} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} Jesus{G2424}."
John,21,5,"Then{G3767} Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Children{G3813}, have ye{G2192}{(G5719)} any{G3387} meat{G4371}? They answered{G611}{(G5662)} him{G846}, No{G3756}."
John,21,6,"And{G1161} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto them{G846}, Cast{G906}{(G5628)} the net{G1350} on{G1519} the right{G1188} side{G3313} of the ship{G4143}, and{G2532} ye shall find{G2147}{(G5692)}. They cast{G906}{(G5627)} therefore{G3767}, and{G2532} now{G3765} they were{G2480} not{G3765} able{G2480}{(G5656)} to draw{G1670}{(G5658)} it{G846} for{G575} the multitude{G4128} of fishes{G2486}."
John,21,7,"Therefore{G3767} that{G1565} disciple{G3101} whom{G3739} Jesus{G2424} loved{G25}{(G5707)} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto Peter{G4074}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} the Lord{G2962}. Now{G3767} when Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} heard{G191}{(G5660)} that{G3754} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} the Lord{G2962}, he girt{G1241}{(G5668)} his fisher's coat{G1903} unto him,(for{G1063} he was{G2258}{(G5713)} naked{G1131},) and{G2532} did cast{G906}{(G5627)} himself{G1438} into{G1519} the sea{G2281}."
John,21,8,"And{G1161} the other{G243} disciples{G3101} came{G2064}{(G5627)} in a little ship{G4142};(for{G1063} they were{G2258}{(G5713)} not{G3756} far{G3112} from{G575} land{G1093}, but{G235} as it were{G5613}{G575} two hundred{G1250} cubits{G4083},) dragging{G4951}{(G5723)} the net{G1350} with fishes{G2486}."
John,21,9,"As soon{G5613} then{G3767} as they were come{G576}{(G5627)} to{G1519} land{G1093}, they saw{G991}{(G5719)} a fire of coals{G439} there, and{G2532} fish{G3795} laid{G2749}{(G5740)} thereon{G1945}{(G5740)}, and{G2532} bread{G740}."
John,21,10,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Bring{G5342}{(G5657)} of{G575} the fish{G3795} which{G3739} ye have{G4084} now{G3568} caught{G4084}{(G5656)}."
John,21,11,"Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074} went up{G305}{(G5627)}, and{G2532} drew{G1670}{(G5656)} the net{G1350} to{G1909} land{G1093} full{G3324} of great{G3173} fishes{G2486}, an hundred{G1540} and fifty{G4004} and three{G5140}: and{G2532} for all there were so many{G5118}, yet was{G5607}{(G5752)} not{G3756} the net{G1350} broken{G4977}{(G5681)}."
John,21,12,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto them{G846}, Come{G1205}{(G5773)} and dine{G709}{(G5657)}. And{G1161} none{G3762} of the disciples{G3101} durst{G5111}{(G5707)} ask{G1833}{(G5658)} him{G846}, Who{G5101} art{G1488}{(G5748)} thou{G4771}? knowing{G1492}{(G5761)} that{G3754} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} the Lord{G2962}."
John,21,13,"Jesus{G2424} then{G3767} cometh{G2064}{(G5736)}, and{G2532} taketh{G2983}{(G5719)} bread{G740}, and{G2532} giveth{G1325}{(G5719)} them{G846}, and{G2532} fish{G3795} likewise{G3668}."
John,21,14,"This{G5124} is{G5319} now{G2235} the third time{G5154} that Jesus{G2424} shewed himself{G5319}{(G5681)} to his{G846} disciples{G3101}, after that he was risen{G1453}{(G5685)} from{G1537} the dead{G3498}."
John,21,15,"So{G3767} when{G3753} they had dined{G709}{(G5656)}, Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} to Simon{G4613} Peter{G4074}, Simon{G4613}, son of Jonas{G2495}, lovest thou{G25}{(G5719)} me{G3165} more than{G4119} these{G5130}? He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Yea{G3483}, Lord{G2962}; thou{G4771} knowest{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} I love{G5368}{(G5719)} thee{G4571}. He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Feed{G1006}{(G5720)} my{G3450} lambs{G721}."
John,21,16,"He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} to him{G846} again{G3825} the second time{G1208}, Simon{G4613}, son of Jonas{G2495}, lovest thou{G25}{(G5719)} me{G3165}? He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Yea{G3483}, Lord{G2962}; thou{G4771} knowest{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} I love{G5368}{(G5719)} thee{G4571}. He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Feed{G4165}{(G5720)} my{G3450} sheep{G4263}."
John,21,17,"He saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846} the third{G5154} time, Simon{G4613}, son of Jonas{G2495}, lovest{G5368}{(G5719)} thou me{G3165}? Peter{G4074} was grieved{G3076}{(G5681)} because{G3754} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846} the third{G5154} time, Lovest{G5368}{(G5719)} thou me{G3165}? And{G2532} he said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto him{G846}, Lord{G2962}, thou{G4771} knowest{G1492}{(G5758)} all things{G3956}; thou{G4771} knowest{G1097}{(G5719)} that{G3754} I love{G5368}{(G5719)} thee{G4571}. Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Feed{G1006}{(G5720)} my{G3450} sheep{G4263}."
John,21,18,"Verily{G281}, verily{G281}, I say{G3004}{(G5719)} unto thee{G4671}, When{G3753} thou wast{G2258}{(G5713)} young{G3501}, thou girdedst{G2224}{(G5707)} thyself{G4572}, and{G2532} walkedst{G4043}{(G5707)} whither{G3699} thou wouldest{G2309}{(G5707)}: but{G1161} when{G3752} thou shalt be old{G1095}{(G5661)}, thou shalt stretch forth{G1614}{(G5692)} thy{G4675} hands{G5495}, and{G2532} another{G243} shall gird{G2224}{(G5692)} thee{G4571}, and{G2532} carry{G5342}{(G5692)} thee whither{G3699} thou wouldest{G2309}{(G5719)} not{G3756}."
John,21,19,"{G1161} This{G5124} spake he{G2036}{(G5627)}, signifying{G4591}{(G5723)} by what{G4169} death{G2288} he should glorify{G1392}{(G5692)} God{G2316}. And{G2532} when he had spoken{G2036}{(G5631)} this{G5124}, he saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, Follow{G190}{(G5720)} me{G3427}."
John,21,20,"Then{G1161} Peter{G4074}, turning about{G1994}{(G5651)}, seeth{G991}{(G5719)} the disciple{G3101} whom{G3739} Jesus{G2424} loved{G25}{(G5707)} following{G190}{(G5723)}; which{G3739} also{G2532} leaned{G377}{(G5627)} on{G1909} his{G846} breast{G4738} at{G1722} supper{G1173}, and{G2532} said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Lord{G2962}, which{G5101} is he{G2076}{(G5748)} that betrayeth{G3860}{(G5723)} thee{G4571}?"
John,21,21,"Peter{G4074} seeing{G1492}{(G5631)} him{G5126} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} to Jesus{G2424}, Lord{G2962}, and{G1161} what{G5101} shall this man{G3778} do?"
John,21,22,"Jesus{G2424} saith{G3004}{(G5719)} unto him{G846}, If{G1437} I will{G2309}{(G5725)} that he{G846} tarry{G3306}{(G5721)} till{G2193} I come{G2064}{(G5736)}, what{G5101} is that to{G4314} thee{G4571}? follow{G190}{(G5720)} thou{G4771} me{G3427}."
John,21,23,"Then{G3767} went{G1831} this{G3778} saying{G3056} abroad{G1831}{(G5627)} among{G1519} the brethren{G80}, that{G3754} that{G1565} disciple{G3101} should{G599} not{G3756} die{G599}{(G5719)}: yet{G2532} Jesus{G2424} said{G2036}{(G5627)} not{G3756} unto him{G846},{G3754} He shall{G599} not{G3756} die{G599}{(G5719)}; but{G235}, If{G1437} I will{G2309}{(G5725)} that he{G846} tarry{G3306}{(G5721)} till{G2193} I come{G2064}{(G5736)}, what{G5101} is that to{G4314} thee{G4571}?"
John,21,24,"This{G3778} is{G2076}{(G5748)} the disciple{G3101} which{G3588} testifieth{G3140}{(G5723)} of{G4012} these things{G5130}, and{G2532} wrote{G1125}{(G5660)} these things{G5023}: and{G2532} we know{G1492}{(G5758)} that{G3754} his{G846} testimony{G3141} is{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227}."
John,21,25,"And{G1161} there are{G2076}{(G5748)} also{G2532} many{G4183} other things{G243} which{G3745} Jesus{G2424} did{G4160}{(G5656)}, the which{G3748}, if{G1437} they should be written{G1125}{(G5747)} every{G2596} one{G1520}, I suppose{G3633}{(G5736)} that even{G3761} the world{G2889} itself{G846} could not{G3761} contain{G5562}{(G5658)} the books{G975} that should be written{G1125}{(G5746)}.

Acts,11,21,"And{G2532} the hand{G5495} of the Lord{G2962} was{G2258}{(G5713)} with{G3326} them{G846}: and{G5037} a great{G4183} number{G706} believed{G4100}{(G5660)}, and turned{G1994}{(G5656)} unto{G1909} the Lord{G2962}."
Acts,11,22,"Then{G1161} tidings{G3056} of{G4012} these things{G846} came{G191}{(G5681)} unto{G1519} the ears{G3775} of the church{G1577} which{G3588} was in{G1722} Jerusalem{G2414}: and{G2532} they sent forth{G1821}{(G5656)} Barnabas{G921}, that he should go{G1330}{(G5629)} as far as{G2193} Antioch{G490}."
Acts,11,23,"Who{G3739}, when he came{G3854}{(G5637)}, and{G2532} had seen{G1492}{(G5631)} the grace{G5485} of God{G2316}, was glad{G5463}{(G5644)}, and{G2532} exhorted{G3870}{(G5707)} them all{G3956}, that with purpose{G4286} of heart{G2588} they would cleave unto{G4357}{(G5721)} the Lord{G2962}."

Acts,12,1,Now{G1161} about{G2596} that{G1565} time{G2540} Herod{G2264} the king{G935} stretched forth{G1911}{(G5627)} his hands{G5495} to vex{G2559}{(G5658)} certain{G5100} of{G575} the church{G1577}.
Acts,12,2,And{G1161} he killed{G337}{(G5627)} James{G2385} the brother{G80} of John{G2491} with the sword{G3162}.

Acts,12,4,"And{G3739}{G2532} when he had apprehended{G4084}{(G5660)} him, he put{G5087}{(G5639)} him in{G1519} prison{G5438}, and delivered{G3860}{(G5631)} him to four{G5064} quaternions{G5069} of soldiers{G4757} to keep{G5442}{(G5721)} him{G846}; intending{G1014}{(G5740)} after{G3326} Easter{G3957} to bring{G321} him{G846} forth{G321}{(G5629)} to the people{G2992}."
Acts,12,5,Peter{G4074}{G3303} therefore{G3767} was kept{G5083}{(G5712)} in{G1722} prison{G5438}: but{G1161} prayer{G4335} was{G2258}{(G5713)} made{G1096}{(G5740)} without ceasing{G1618} of{G5259} the church{G1577} unto{G4314} God{G2316} for{G5228} him{G846}.

Acts,12,7,"And{G2532}, behold{G2400}{(G5628)}, the angel{G32} of the Lord{G2962} came upon{G2186}{(G5627)} him, and{G2532} a light{G5457} shined{G2989}{(G5656)} in{G1722} the prison{G3612}: and{G1161} he smote{G3960}{(G5660)} Peter{G4074} on the side{G4125}, and raised{G1453} him{G846} up{G1453}{(G5656)}, saying{G3004}{(G5723)}, Arise up{G450}{(G5628)} quickly{G1722}{G5034}.

Acts,12,8,"And{G5037} the angel{G32} said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} him{G846}, Gird thyself{G4024}{(G5669)}, and{G2532} bind on{G5265}{(G5669)} thy{G4675} sandals{G4547}.

Acts,12,9,"And{G2532} he went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and followed{G190}{(G5707)} him{G846}; and{G2532} wist{G1492}{(G5715)} not{G3756} that{G3754} it was{G2076}{(G5748)} true{G227} which{G3588} was done{G1096}{(G5740)} by{G1223} the angel{G32}; but{G1161} thought{G1380}{(G5707)} he saw{G991}{(G5721)} a vision{G3705}."
Acts,12,10,"When{G1161} they were past{G1330}{(G5631)} the first{G4413} and{G2532} the second{G1208} ward{G5438}, they came{G2064}{(G5627)} unto{G1909} the iron{G4603} gate{G4439} that leadeth{G5342}{(G5723)} unto{G1519} the city{G4172}; which{G3748} opened{G455}{(G5681)} to them{G846} of his own accord{G844}: and{G2532} they went out{G1831}{(G5631)}, and passed on through{G4281}{(G5627)} one{G3391} street{G4505}; and{G2532} forthwith{G2112} the angel{G32} departed{G868}{(G5627)} from{G575} him{G846}."
Acts,12,11,"And{G2532} when Peter{G4074} was come{G1096}{(G5637)} to{G1722} himself{G1438}, he said{G2036}{(G5627)}, Now{G3568} I know{G1492}{(G5758)} of a surety{G230}, that{G3754} the Lord{G2962} hath sent{G1821}{(G5656)} his{G846} angel{G32}, and{G2532} hath delivered{G1807}{(G5639)} me{G3165} out of{G1537} the hand{G5495} of Herod{G2264}, and{G2532} from all{G3956} the expectation{G4329} of the people{G2992} of the Jews{G2453}."

Acts,12,13,"And{G1161} as Peter{G4074} knocked at{G2925}{(G5660)} the door{G2374} of the gate{G4440}, a damsel{G3814} came{G4334}{(G5627)} to hearken{G5219}{(G5658)}, named{G3686} Rhoda{G4498}."
Acts,12,14,"And{G2532} when she knew{G1921}{(G5631)} Peter's{G4074} voice{G5456}, she opened{G455}{(G5656)} not{G3756} the gate{G4440} for{G575} gladness{G5479}, but{G1161} ran in{G1532}{(G5631)}, and told how{G518}{(G5656)} Peter{G4074} stood{G2476}{(G5760)} before{G4253} the gate{G4440}."
Acts,12,15,"And{G1161} they said{G2036}{(G5627)} unto{G4314} her{G846}, Thou art mad{G3105}{(G5736)}. But{G1161} she constantly affirmed{G1340}{(G5711)} that it was{G2192}{(G5721)} even so{G3779}. Then{G1161} said they{G3004}{(G5707)}, It is{G2076}{(G5748)} his{G846} angel{G32}."
Acts,12,16,"But{G1161} Peter{G4074} continued{G1961}{(G5707)} knocking{G2925}{(G5723)}: and{G1161} when they had opened{G455}{(G5660)} the door, and saw{G1492}{(G5627)} him{G846},{G2532} they were astonished{G1839}{(G5627)}."
Acts,12,17,"But{G1161} he, beckoning{G2678}{(G5660)} unto them{G846} with the hand{G5495} to hold their peace{G4601}{(G5721)}, declared{G1334}{(G5662)} unto them{G846} how{G4459} the Lord{G2962} had brought{G1806}{(G5627)} him{G846} out of{G1537} the prison{G5438}.

Acts,12,18,"Now{G1161} as soon as it was{G1096}{(G5637)} day{G2250}, there was{G2258}{(G5713)} no{G3756} small{G3641} stir{G5017} among{G1722} the soldiers{G4757}, what{G5101}{G686} was become{G1096}{(G5633)} of Peter{G4074}."
Acts,12,19,"And{G1161} when{G1934} Herod{G2264} had sought for{G1934}{(G5660)} him{G846}, and{G2532} found him{G2147}{(G5631)} not{G3361}, he examined{G350}{(G5660)} the keepers{G5441}, and commanded{G2753}{(G5656)} that they should be put to death{G520}{(G5683)}. And{G2532} he went down{G2718}{(G5631)} from{G575} Judaea{G2449} to{G1519} Caesarea{G2542}, and there abode{G1304}{(G5707)}."
Acts,12,20,"And{G1161} Herod{G2264} was{G2258}{(G5713)} highly displeased{G2371}{(G5723)} with them of Tyre{G5183} and{G2532} Sidon{G4606}: but{G1161} they came{G3918}{(G5713)} with one accord{G3661} to{G4314} him{G846}, and{G2532}, having made{G3982} Blastus{G986} the king's{G935} chamberlain{G1909}{G2846} their friend{G3982}{(G5660)}, desired{G154}{(G5710)} peace{G1515}; because{G1223} their{G846} country{G5561} was nourished{G5142}{(G5745)} by{G575} the king's{G937} country."
Acts,12,21,"And{G1161} upon a set{G5002} day{G2250} Herod{G2264}, arrayed{G1746}{(G5671)} in royal{G937} apparel{G2066}, sat{G2523}{(G5660)} upon{G1909} his throne{G968}, and{G2532} made an oration{G1215}{(G5707)} unto{G4314} them{G846}."
Acts,12,22,"And{G1161} the people{G1218} gave a shout{G2019}{(G5707)}, saying, It is the voice{G5456} of a god{G2316}, and{G2532} not{G3756} of a man{G444}."
Acts,12,23,"And{G1161} immediately{G3916} the angel{G32} of the Lord{G2962} smote{G3960}{(G5656)} him{G846}, because{G473}{G3739} he gave{G1325}{(G5656)} not{G3756} God{G2316} the glory{G1391}: and{G2532} he was{G1096}{(G5637)} eaten of worms{G4662}, and gave up the ghost{G1634}{(G5656)}."
Acts,12,24,But{G1161} the word{G3056} of God{G2316} grew{G837}{(G5707)} and{G2532} multiplied{G4129}{(G5712)}.
