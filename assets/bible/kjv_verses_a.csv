Nahum,1,1,The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum,1,2,"God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies."
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth."
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him."
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies."
Nahum,1,9,What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,"For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry."
Nahum,1,11,"There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more."
Nahum,1,13,"For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder."
Nahum,1,14,"And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile."
Nahum,1,15,"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off."
Nahum,2,1,"He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily."
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken."
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings."
Nahum,2,5,"He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared."
Nahum,2,6,"The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved."
Nahum,2,7,"And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back."
Nahum,2,9,"Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture."
Nahum,2,10,"She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness."
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin."
Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard."
Nahum,3,1,Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not;
Nahum,3,2,"The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots."
Nahum,3,3,"The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:"
Nahum,3,4,"Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts."
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame."
Nahum,3,6,"And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock."
Nahum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?"
Nahum,3,8,"Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?"
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,"Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy."
Nahum,3,12,"All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars."
Nahum,3,14,"Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln."
Nahum,3,15,"There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts."
Nahum,3,16,"Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away."
Nahum,3,17,"Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are."
Nahum,3,18,"Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them."
Nahum,3,19,There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
Genesis,1,3,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."

Genesis,1,9,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."

Genesis,1,14,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:"
Genesis,1,15,And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis,1,16,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."
Genesis,1,17,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."

Genesis,1,23,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
Genesis,1,24,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
Genesis,1,27,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
Genesis,1,28,"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
Genesis,1,29,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."
Genesis,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so."
Genesis,1,31,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
Genesis,2,2,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Genesis,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
Genesis,2,4,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,"
Genesis,2,5,"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."
Genesis,2,6,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
Genesis,2,7,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
Genesis,2,8,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis,2,9,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
Genesis,2,12,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
Genesis,2,13,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
Genesis,2,14,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
Genesis,2,15,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
Genesis,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
Genesis,2,17,"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
Genesis,2,18,"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."
Genesis,2,19,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof."
Genesis,2,20,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him."
Genesis,2,21,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;"
Genesis,2,22,"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."
Genesis,2,23,"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
Genesis,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
Genesis,3,2,"And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
Genesis,3,3,"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
Genesis,3,4,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
Genesis,3,5,"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
Genesis,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."
Genesis,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
Genesis,3,8,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
Genesis,3,9,"And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
Genesis,3,10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
Genesis,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
Genesis,3,12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
Genesis,3,13,"And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
Genesis,3,14,"And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
Genesis,3,15,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
Genesis,3,16,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
Genesis,3,17,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
Genesis,3,18,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
Genesis,3,19,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
Genesis,3,20,And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Genesis,3,21,"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them."
Genesis,3,22,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
Genesis,3,23,"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
Genesis,3,24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
Genesis,4,1,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
Genesis,4,2,"And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
Genesis,4,3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD."
Genesis,4,4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"
Genesis,4,5,"But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
Genesis,4,6,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
Genesis,4,7,"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."
Genesis,4,8,"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
Genesis,4,9,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
Genesis,4,10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
Genesis,4,12,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
Genesis,4,13,"And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
Genesis,4,14,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me."
Genesis,4,15,"And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."
Genesis,4,16,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."

Genesis,4,19,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle."
Genesis,4,21,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
Genesis,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."
Genesis,4,23,"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."

Genesis,7,6,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
Genesis,7,7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
Genesis,7,8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,"
Genesis,7,9,"There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."
Genesis,7,10,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
Genesis,7,12,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
Genesis,7,14,"They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort."
Genesis,7,15,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life."
Genesis,7,16,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."
Genesis,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth."
Genesis,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
Genesis,7,19,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered."
Genesis,7,20,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
Genesis,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
Genesis,7,22,"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died."
Genesis,7,23,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."
Genesis,7,24,And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
Genesis,8,1,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
Genesis,8,2,"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
Genesis,8,3,And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
Genesis,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
Genesis,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
Genesis,8,7,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
Genesis,8,8,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
Genesis,8,9,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."
Genesis,8,10,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
Genesis,8,11,"And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
Genesis,8,12,And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
Genesis,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry."
Genesis,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
Genesis,8,15,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
Genesis,8,16,"Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
Genesis,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
Genesis,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark."
Genesis,8,20,"And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
Genesis,8,21,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
Genesis,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered."
Genesis,9,3,Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
Genesis,9,4,"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
Genesis,9,5,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man."
Genesis,9,6,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
Genesis,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
Genesis,9,8,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
Genesis,9,9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
Genesis,9,10,"And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth."
Genesis,9,11,"And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."
Genesis,9,12,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
Genesis,9,13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
Genesis,9,15,"And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
Genesis,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
Genesis,9,17,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
Genesis,9,18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan."
Genesis,9,19,These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
Genesis,9,20,"And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
Genesis,9,21,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."
Genesis,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
Genesis,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
Genesis,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him."
Genesis,9,25,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."
Genesis,9,26,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
Genesis,9,27,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
Genesis,9,28,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Genesis,9,29,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
Genesis,10,1,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood."
Genesis,10,2,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
Genesis,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
Genesis,10,4,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
Genesis,10,5,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
Genesis,10,6,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
Genesis,10,7,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan."
Genesis,10,8,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
Genesis,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
Genesis,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
Genesis,10,11,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
Genesis,10,12,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
Genesis,10,13,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
Genesis,10,14,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
Genesis,10,15,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,"
Genesis,10,16,"And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,"
Genesis,10,17,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
Genesis,10,18,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad."
Genesis,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha."
Genesis,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."
Genesis,10,21,"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born."
Genesis,10,22,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
Genesis,10,23,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
Genesis,10,24,And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
Genesis,10,25,And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
Genesis,10,26,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
Genesis,10,27,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
Genesis,10,28,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
Genesis,10,29,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
Genesis,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east."
Genesis,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
Genesis,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
Genesis,11,1,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
Genesis,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
Genesis,11,3,"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter."
Genesis,11,4,"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
Genesis,11,5,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded."
Genesis,11,6,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."
Genesis,11,7,"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
Genesis,11,8,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
Genesis,11,9,Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
Genesis,11,10,"These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
Genesis,11,11,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,12,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:"
Genesis,11,13,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,14,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
Genesis,11,15,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
Genesis,11,17,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
Genesis,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
Genesis,11,21,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
Genesis,11,23,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
Genesis,11,25,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
Genesis,11,27,"Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
Genesis,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
Genesis,11,30,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Genesis,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there."
Genesis,11,32,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis,12,1,"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:"
Genesis,12,2,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
Genesis,12,3,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
Genesis,12,4,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
Genesis,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
Genesis,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
Genesis,12,7,"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him."
Genesis,12,8,"And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD."
Genesis,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south."
Genesis,12,10,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
Genesis,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
Genesis,12,12,"Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
Genesis,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
Genesis,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
Genesis,12,15,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
Genesis,12,16,"And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels."
Genesis,12,17,And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
Genesis,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?"
Genesis,12,19,"Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
Genesis,12,20,"And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
Genesis,13,1,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
Genesis,13,2,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
Genesis,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;"
Genesis,13,4,"Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
Genesis,13,5,"And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
Genesis,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
Genesis,13,7,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
Genesis,13,8,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren."
Genesis,13,9,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
Genesis,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar."
Genesis,13,11,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis,13,12,"Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
Genesis,13,14,"And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
Genesis,13,15,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
Genesis,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered."
Genesis,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee."
Genesis,13,18,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD."
Genesis,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
Genesis,14,2,"That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
Genesis,14,3,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
Genesis,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
Genesis,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
Genesis,14,6,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness."
Genesis,14,7,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar."
Genesis,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;"
Genesis,14,9,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
Genesis,14,10,"And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."
Genesis,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
Genesis,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
Genesis,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram."
Genesis,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan."
Genesis,14,15,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
Genesis,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale."
Genesis,14,18,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
Genesis,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
Genesis,14,20,"And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
Genesis,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
Genesis,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,23,"That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
Genesis,14,24,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
Genesis,15,1,"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
Genesis,15,2,"And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
Genesis,15,3,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir."
Genesis,15,4,"And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
Genesis,15,5,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
Genesis,15,6,And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
Genesis,15,7,"And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
Genesis,15,8,"And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
Genesis,15,9,"And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
Genesis,15,10,"And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not."
Genesis,15,11,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away."
Genesis,15,12,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him."
Genesis,15,13,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
Genesis,15,14,"And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
Genesis,15,15,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Genesis,15,16,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
Genesis,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
Genesis,15,18,"In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:"

Genesis,16,1,"Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
Genesis,16,2,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
Genesis,16,3,"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
Genesis,16,4,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
Genesis,16,5,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee."
Genesis,16,6,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."
Genesis,16,7,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
Genesis,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."

Genesis,16,11,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction."
Genesis,16,12,"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
Genesis,16,13,"And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
Genesis,16,14,"Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
Genesis,16,15,"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael."
Genesis,16,16,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."
Genesis,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
Genesis,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
Genesis,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
Genesis,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations."
Genesis,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
Genesis,17,6,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
Genesis,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee."
Genesis,17,8,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
Genesis,17,9,"And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations."
Genesis,17,10,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised."
Genesis,17,11,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
Genesis,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed."
Genesis,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
Genesis,17,14,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
Genesis,17,15,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
Genesis,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her."
Genesis,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
Genesis,17,19,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him."
Genesis,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
Genesis,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year."
Genesis,17,22,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
Genesis,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him."
Genesis,17,24,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
Genesis,17,25,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
Genesis,17,26,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
Genesis,17,27,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
Genesis,18,1,And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis,18,2,"And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
Genesis,18,3,"And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
Genesis,18,4,"Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
Genesis,18,5,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
Genesis,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth."
Genesis,18,7,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
Genesis,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
Genesis,18,9,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
Genesis,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him."
Genesis,18,11,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
Genesis,18,13,"And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?"
Genesis,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
Genesis,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
Genesis,18,16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
Genesis,18,17,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;"
Genesis,18,18,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
Genesis,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
Genesis,18,20,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
Genesis,18,22,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD."
Genesis,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
Genesis,18,24,Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
Genesis,18,25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
Genesis,18,26,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
Genesis,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:"
Genesis,18,28,"Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
Genesis,18,29,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake."
Genesis,18,30,"And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
Genesis,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
Genesis,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake."
Genesis,18,33,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."
Genesis,19,1,And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
Genesis,19,2,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
Genesis,19,3,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
Genesis,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
Genesis,19,5,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
Genesis,19,6,"And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,"
Genesis,19,7,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
Genesis,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
Genesis,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door."
Genesis,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
Genesis,19,11,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
Genesis,19,12,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:"
Genesis,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it."
Genesis,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law."
Genesis,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
Genesis,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
Genesis,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
Genesis,19,18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:"
Genesis,19,19,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:"
Genesis,19,20,"Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live."
Genesis,19,21,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken."
Genesis,19,22,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
Genesis,19,23,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
Genesis,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis,19,27,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
Genesis,19,28,"And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
Genesis,19,30,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
Genesis,19,31,"And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
Genesis,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
Genesis,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
Genesis,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
Genesis,19,36,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Genesis,19,37,"And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day."
Genesis,19,38,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day."
Genesis,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
Genesis,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife."
Genesis,20,4,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
Genesis,20,5,"Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this."
Genesis,20,6,"And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."
Genesis,20,8,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid."
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
Genesis,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake."
Genesis,20,12,"And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
Genesis,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
Genesis,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."
Genesis,20,17,"So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children."
Genesis,20,18,"For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife."
Genesis,21,1,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken."
Genesis,21,2,"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
Genesis,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac."
Genesis,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me."
Genesis,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age."
Genesis,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."
Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking."
Genesis,21,10,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
Genesis,21,12,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
Genesis,21,13,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
Genesis,21,14,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
Genesis,21,15,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
Genesis,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept."
Genesis,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
Genesis,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation."
Genesis,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
Genesis,21,20,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
Genesis,21,21,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
Genesis,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:"
Genesis,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
Genesis,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
Genesis,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
Genesis,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day."
Genesis,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
Genesis,21,28,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis,21,29,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
Genesis,21,30,"And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
Genesis,21,31,Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
Genesis,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
Genesis,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am."
Genesis,22,2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
Genesis,22,3,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
Genesis,22,4,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
Genesis,22,5,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
Genesis,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together."
Genesis,22,7,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
Genesis,22,8,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
Genesis,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
Genesis,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
Genesis,22,11,"And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I."
Genesis,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me."
Genesis,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son."
Genesis,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen."
Genesis,22,15,"And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,"
Genesis,22,16,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:"
Genesis,22,17,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
Genesis,22,18,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
Genesis,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;"
Genesis,22,21,"Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
Genesis,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
Genesis,22,23,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
Genesis,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
Genesis,23,1,And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
Genesis,23,3,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
Genesis,23,4,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
Genesis,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
Genesis,23,6,"Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
Genesis,23,7,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."

Genesis,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you."
Genesis,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
Genesis,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead."
Genesis,23,12,And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
Genesis,23,13,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
Genesis,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
Genesis,23,15,"My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."

Genesis,23,17,"And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure"
Genesis,23,18,"Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
Genesis,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth."

Genesis,24,4,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac."
Genesis,24,5,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
Genesis,24,6,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again."
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence."

Genesis,24,12,"And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
Genesis,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master."
Genesis,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
Genesis,24,16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
Genesis,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher."
Genesis,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
Genesis,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
Genesis,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
Genesis,24,21,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not."

Genesis,24,42,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:"
Genesis,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;"
Genesis,24,44,"And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son."
Genesis,24,45,"And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
Genesis,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."

Genesis,24,62,And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
Genesis,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming."
Genesis,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel."
Genesis,24,65,"For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

Genesis,25,5,And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,"But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
Genesis,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years."
Genesis,25,8,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."

Genesis,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"

Genesis,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people."
Genesis,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren."
Genesis,25,19,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
Genesis,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
Genesis,25,21,"And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
Genesis,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD."
Genesis,25,23,"And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger."
Genesis,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,"And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."
Genesis,25,26,"And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them."
Genesis,25,27,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents."
Genesis,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
Genesis,25,29,"And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:"
Genesis,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
Genesis,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright."
Genesis,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
Genesis,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
Genesis,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright."
Genesis,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar."
Genesis,26,2,"And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:"
Genesis,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;"
Genesis,26,4,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;"
Genesis,26,5,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
Genesis,26,6,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
Genesis,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon."
Genesis,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
Genesis,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her."
Genesis,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us."
Genesis,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
Genesis,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him."
Genesis,26,13,"And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:"
Genesis,26,14,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him."
Genesis,26,15,"For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
Genesis,26,16,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we."
Genesis,26,17,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
Genesis,26,18,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
Genesis,26,19,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
Genesis,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
Genesis,26,21,"And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
Genesis,26,22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
Genesis,26,23,And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,"And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
Genesis,26,25,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well."
Genesis,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
Genesis,26,27,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
Genesis,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
Genesis,26,29,"That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD."
Genesis,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
Genesis,26,31,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water."
Genesis,26,33,And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.
Genesis,26,34,"And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
Genesis,26,35,Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I."
Genesis,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
Genesis,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;"
Genesis,27,4,"And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."
Genesis,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
Genesis,27,6,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
Genesis,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death."
Genesis,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
Genesis,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
Genesis,27,10,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death."
Genesis,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:"
Genesis,27,12,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
Genesis,27,13,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them."
Genesis,27,14,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved."
Genesis,27,15,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:"
Genesis,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:"
Genesis,27,17,"And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
Genesis,27,18,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
Genesis,27,19,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
Genesis,27,20,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me."
Genesis,27,21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
Genesis,27,22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
Genesis,27,23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him."
Genesis,27,24,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
Genesis,27,25,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
Genesis,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:"
Genesis,27,28,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:"
Genesis,27,29,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee."
Genesis,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
Genesis,27,31,"And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
Genesis,27,32,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau."
Genesis,27,33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed."
Genesis,27,34,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
Genesis,27,35,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing."
Genesis,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
Genesis,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?"
Genesis,27,38,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
Genesis,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
Genesis,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
Genesis,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
Genesis,27,42,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee."
Genesis,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
Genesis,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;"
Genesis,27,45,"Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
Genesis,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
Genesis,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
Genesis,28,2,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother."
Genesis,28,3,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
Genesis,28,4,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham."
Genesis,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
Genesis,28,6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;"
Genesis,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;"
Genesis,28,8,And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
Genesis,28,9,"Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
Genesis,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
Genesis,28,11,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
Genesis,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
Genesis,28,13,"And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;"
Genesis,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
Genesis,28,15,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."
Genesis,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not."
Genesis,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
Genesis,28,18,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
Genesis,28,19,And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
Genesis,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
Genesis,28,21,So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
Genesis,28,22,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
Genesis,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
Genesis,29,2,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth."
Genesis,29,3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place."
Genesis,29,4,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we."
Genesis,29,5,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him."
Genesis,29,6,"And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
Genesis,29,7,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
Genesis,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
Genesis,29,9,"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them."
Genesis,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
Genesis,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
Genesis,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father."
Genesis,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
Genesis,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
Genesis,29,15,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
Genesis,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
Genesis,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
Genesis,29,19,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
Genesis,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
Genesis,29,21,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
Genesis,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
Genesis,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her."
Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
Genesis,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
Genesis,29,26,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
Genesis,29,27,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
Genesis,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also."
Genesis,29,29,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
Genesis,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
Genesis,29,31,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren."
Genesis,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
Genesis,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon."
Genesis,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing."
Genesis,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
Genesis,30,2,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
Genesis,30,3,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
Genesis,30,4,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
Genesis,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."
Genesis,30,6,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
Genesis,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."
Genesis,30,8,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife."
Genesis,30,10,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
Genesis,30,12,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
Genesis,30,15,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes."
Genesis,30,16,"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
Genesis,30,17,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son."
Genesis,30,20,"And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
Genesis,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
Genesis,30,23,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
Genesis,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son."
Genesis,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee."
Genesis,30,27,"And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake."
Genesis,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
Genesis,30,29,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me."
Genesis,30,30,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?"
Genesis,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock."
Genesis,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire."
Genesis,30,33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me."
Genesis,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
Genesis,30,35,"And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
Genesis,30,36,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
Genesis,30,37,"And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
Genesis,30,38,"And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
Genesis,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted."
Genesis,30,40,"And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle."
Genesis,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
Genesis,30,42,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
Genesis,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses."
Genesis,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory."
Genesis,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before."
Genesis,31,3,"And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
Genesis,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
Genesis,31,5,"And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me."
Genesis,31,6,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Genesis,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
Genesis,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked."
Genesis,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
Genesis,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled."
Genesis,31,11,"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I."
Genesis,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred."
Genesis,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
Genesis,31,15,"Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money."
Genesis,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do."
Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
Genesis,31,18,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,31,19,And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
Genesis,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
Genesis,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
Genesis,31,25,Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
Genesis,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
Genesis,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
Genesis,31,28,And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
Genesis,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
Genesis,31,30,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
Genesis,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me."
Genesis,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
Genesis,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not."
Genesis,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images."
Genesis,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
Genesis,31,37,"Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."
Genesis,31,38,"This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
Genesis,31,39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night."
Genesis,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes."
Genesis,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
Genesis,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
Genesis,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?"
Genesis,31,44,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
Genesis,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
Genesis,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap."
Genesis,31,47,And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
Genesis,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;"
Genesis,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
Genesis,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
Genesis,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:"
Genesis,31,52,"This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
Genesis,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,54,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
Genesis,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place."
Genesis,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
Genesis,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:"
Genesis,32,5,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
Genesis,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
Genesis,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;"
Genesis,32,8,"And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
Genesis,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:"
Genesis,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands."
Genesis,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children."
Genesis,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
Genesis,32,13,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
Genesis,32,14,"Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,"
Genesis,32,15,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals."
Genesis,32,16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
Genesis,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
Genesis,32,18,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us."
Genesis,32,19,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him."
Genesis,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me."
Genesis,32,21,So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
Genesis,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had."
Genesis,32,24,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
Genesis,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
Genesis,32,27,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
Genesis,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
Genesis,32,29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there."
Genesis,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
Genesis,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank."
Genesis,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
Genesis,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
Genesis,33,3,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
Genesis,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
Genesis,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant."
Genesis,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
Genesis,33,7,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
Genesis,33,8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord."
Genesis,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself."
Genesis,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."
Genesis,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it."
Genesis,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
Genesis,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
Genesis,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
Genesis,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
Genesis,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
Genesis,33,18,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city."
Genesis,33,19,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money."
Genesis,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael."
Genesis,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
Genesis,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
Genesis,34,3,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel."
Genesis,34,4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
Genesis,34,5,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
Genesis,34,6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
Genesis,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done."
Genesis,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife."
Genesis,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
Genesis,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
Genesis,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
Genesis,34,12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife."
Genesis,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:"
Genesis,34,14,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:"
Genesis,34,15,"But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;"
Genesis,34,16,"Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
Genesis,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
Genesis,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
Genesis,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father."
Genesis,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
Genesis,34,21,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
Genesis,34,22,"Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
Genesis,34,23,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
Genesis,34,24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
Genesis,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
Genesis,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out."
Genesis,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister."
Genesis,34,28,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,"
Genesis,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house."
Genesis,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
Genesis,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
Genesis,35,1,"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
Genesis,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
Genesis,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
Genesis,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him."
Genesis,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
Genesis,35,8,"But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth."
Genesis,35,9,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;"
Genesis,35,12,"And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
Genesis,35,13,And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
Genesis,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
Genesis,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel."
Genesis,35,16,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour."
Genesis,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
Genesis,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
Genesis,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
Genesis,35,20,And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
Genesis,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
Genesis,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
Genesis,35,23,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
Genesis,35,24,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
Genesis,35,25,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
Genesis,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram."
Genesis,35,27,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
Genesis,35,28,And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
Genesis,35,29,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
Genesis,36,1,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
Genesis,36,3,"And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
Genesis,36,4,And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
Genesis,36,5,"And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
Genesis,36,7,For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
Genesis,36,8,Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
Genesis,36,9,And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau."
Genesis,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
Genesis,36,13,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
Genesis,36,14,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."

Genesis,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,"
Genesis,36,21,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
Genesis,36,22,And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
Genesis,36,23,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
Genesis,36,24,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
Genesis,36,25,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah."
Genesis,36,26,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
Genesis,36,27,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan."
Genesis,36,28,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran."
Genesis,36,29,"These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,"
Genesis,36,30,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir."
Genesis,36,31,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
Genesis,36,32,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis,36,33,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
Genesis,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
Genesis,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
Genesis,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
Genesis,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead."
Genesis,36,38,"And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
Genesis,36,39,"And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
Genesis,36,40,"And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,"
Genesis,36,41,"Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,"
Genesis,36,42,"Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,"
Genesis,36,43,"Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites."
Genesis,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report."
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours."
Genesis,37,4,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
Genesis,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
Genesis,37,6,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
Genesis,37,7,"For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf."
Genesis,37,8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
Genesis,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
Genesis,37,10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
Genesis,37,11,And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
Genesis,37,12,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I."
Genesis,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
Genesis,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
Genesis,37,16,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks."
Genesis,37,17,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
Genesis,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh."
Genesis,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
Genesis,37,21,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him."
Genesis,37,22,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again."
Genesis,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;"
Genesis,37,24,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
Genesis,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content."
Genesis,37,28,"Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes."
Genesis,37,30,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
Genesis,37,31,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
Genesis,37,32,"And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no."
Genesis,37,33,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."
Genesis,37,34,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
Genesis,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
Genesis,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her."
Genesis,38,3,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er."
Genesis,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan."
Genesis,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him."
Genesis,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
Genesis,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
Genesis,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother."
Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
Genesis,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
Genesis,38,12,"And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
Genesis,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep."
Genesis,38,14,"And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
Genesis,38,17,"And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?"
Genesis,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
Genesis,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
Genesis,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
Genesis,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place."
Genesis,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place."
Genesis,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
Genesis,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
Genesis,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
Genesis,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
Genesis,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
Genesis,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez."
Genesis,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah."
Genesis,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither."
Genesis,39,2,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
Genesis,39,3,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
Genesis,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
Genesis,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."
Genesis,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured."
Genesis,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;"
Genesis,39,9,"There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
Genesis,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
Genesis,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
Genesis,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
Genesis,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
Genesis,39,14,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
Genesis,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out."
Genesis,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
Genesis,39,17,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
Genesis,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out."
Genesis,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
Genesis,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
Genesis,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."
Genesis,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper."
Genesis,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
Genesis,40,3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
Genesis,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward."
Genesis,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison."
Genesis,40,6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad."
Genesis,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?"
Genesis,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
Genesis,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
Genesis,40,10,"And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
Genesis,40,11,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
Genesis,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:"
Genesis,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
Genesis,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:"
Genesis,40,17,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
Genesis,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:"
Genesis,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
Genesis,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
Genesis,40,21,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
Genesis,40,22,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
Genesis,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
Genesis,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
Genesis,41,3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river."
Genesis,41,4,And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
Genesis,41,6,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
Genesis,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:"
Genesis,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
Genesis,41,12,"And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
Genesis,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged."
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it."
Genesis,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
Genesis,41,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
Genesis,41,18,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:"
Genesis,41,19,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
Genesis,41,20,And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
Genesis,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
Genesis,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:"
Genesis,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
Genesis,41,24,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
Genesis,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do."
Genesis,41,26,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
Genesis,41,27,And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
Genesis,41,28,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
Genesis,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
Genesis,41,30,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
Genesis,41,31,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
Genesis,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
Genesis,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
Genesis,41,36,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
Genesis,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
Genesis,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:"
Genesis,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
Genesis,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,45,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,47,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
Genesis,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same."
Genesis,41,49,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number."
Genesis,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him."
Genesis,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
Genesis,41,52,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis,41,53,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
Genesis,41,54,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
Genesis,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
Genesis,42,1,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
Genesis,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
Genesis,42,3,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him."
Genesis,42,5,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
Genesis,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
Genesis,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
Genesis,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
Genesis,42,10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come."
Genesis,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies."
Genesis,42,12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
Genesis,42,13,"And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
Genesis,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:"
Genesis,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
Genesis,42,17,And he put them all together into ward three days.
Genesis,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:"
Genesis,42,19,"If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
Genesis,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
Genesis,42,21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
Genesis,42,23,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
Genesis,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them."
Genesis,42,26,"And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence."
Genesis,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
Genesis,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
Genesis,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,"
Genesis,42,30,"The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
Genesis,42,31,"And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:"
Genesis,42,32,"We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
Genesis,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land."
Genesis,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
Genesis,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
Genesis,42,37,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
Genesis,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,43,1,And the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
Genesis,43,3,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
Genesis,43,4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
Genesis,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
Genesis,43,6,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
Genesis,43,7,"And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
Genesis,43,8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
Genesis,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
Genesis,43,10,"For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time."
Genesis,43,11,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
Genesis,43,12,"And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:"
Genesis,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
Genesis,43,14,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
Genesis,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon."
Genesis,43,17,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
Genesis,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
Genesis,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
Genesis,43,20,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
Genesis,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
Genesis,43,22,And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis,43,23,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
Genesis,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender."
Genesis,43,25,And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Genesis,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
Genesis,43,27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?"
Genesis,43,28,"And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance."
Genesis,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son."
Genesis,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
Genesis,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
Genesis,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
Genesis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another."
Genesis,43,34,"And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him."
Genesis,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
Genesis,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
Genesis,44,4,"And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
Genesis,44,5,"Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
Genesis,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words."
Genesis,44,7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
Genesis,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen."
Genesis,44,10,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless."
Genesis,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
Genesis,44,12,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
Genesis,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis,44,15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
Genesis,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
Genesis,44,17,"And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
Genesis,44,20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
Genesis,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
Genesis,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
Genesis,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
Genesis,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
Genesis,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food."
Genesis,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us."
Genesis,44,27,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:"
Genesis,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:"
Genesis,44,29,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
Genesis,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever."
Genesis,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren."
Genesis,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father."
Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren."
Genesis,45,2,And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis,45,3,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."

Genesis,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
Genesis,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him."
Genesis,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn."

Galatians,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed."
Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God in me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also."
Galatians,2,2,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
Galatians,2,4,"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
Galatians,2,5,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
Galatians,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:"
Galatians,2,7,"But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;"
Galatians,2,8,"(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
Galatians,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
Galatians,2,10,Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
Galatians,2,11,"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
Galatians,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."
Galatians,2,13,And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
Galatians,2,15,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
Galatians,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."
Galatians,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
Galatians,2,19,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
Galatians,2,20,"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
Galatians,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
Galatians,3,2,"This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
Galatians,3,5,"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
Galatians,3,6,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
Galatians,3,7,"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
Galatians,3,8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed."
Galatians,3,9,So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
Galatians,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
Galatians,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
Galatians,3,12,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them."
Galatians,3,13,"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"
Galatians,3,14,That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Galatians,3,15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto."
Galatians,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
Galatians,3,19,"Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
Galatians,3,21,"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
Galatians,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
Galatians,3,26,For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Galatians,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;"
Galatians,4,2,But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
Galatians,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
Galatians,4,4,"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
Galatians,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
Galatians,4,6,"And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
Galatians,4,7,"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
Galatians,4,8,"Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
Galatians,4,10,"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."
Galatians,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
Galatians,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all."
Galatians,4,13,Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
Galatians,4,14,"And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
Galatians,4,15,"Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
Galatians,4,17,"They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them."
Galatians,4,18,"But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
Galatians,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman."
Galatians,4,23,But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.
Galatians,4,24,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."
Galatians,4,25,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
Galatians,4,26,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband."
Galatians,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now."
Galatians,4,30,Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
Galatians,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
Galatians,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
Galatians,5,2,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
Galatians,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
Galatians,5,4,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
Galatians,5,5,For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Galatians,5,6,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
Galatians,5,7,Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
Galatians,5,9,A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
Galatians,5,11,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased."
Galatians,5,12,I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
Galatians,5,13,"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
Galatians,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
Galatians,5,15,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."
Galatians,5,16,"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."
Galatians,5,18,"But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,"
Galatians,5,20,"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,"
Galatians,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
Galatians,5,23,"Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
Galatians,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
Galatians,6,3,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
Galatians,6,5,For every man shall bear his own burden.
Galatians,6,6,Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Galatians,6,7,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
Galatians,6,8,For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Galatians,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
Galatians,6,10,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
Galatians,6,11,Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
Galatians,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
Galatians,6,13,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
Galatians,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
Galatians,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
Galatians,6,17,From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
Galatians,6,18,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
Ephesians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
Ephesians,1,2,"Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"
Ephesians,1,4,"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
Ephesians,1,5,"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
Ephesians,1,6,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved."
Ephesians,1,7,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
Ephesians,1,8,Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
Ephesians,1,9,"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:"
Ephesians,1,10,"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:"
Ephesians,1,11,"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:"
Ephesians,1,12,"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
Ephesians,1,13,"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,"
Ephesians,1,14,"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
Ephesians,1,15,"Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,"
Ephesians,1,16,"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
Ephesians,1,17,"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
Ephesians,1,18,"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
Ephesians,1,19,"And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
Ephesians,1,20,"Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,"
Ephesians,1,21,"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
Ephesians,1,22,"And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
Ephesians,1,23,"Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
Ephesians,2,2,"Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"
Ephesians,2,3,"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,"
Ephesians,2,5,"Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)"
Ephesians,2,6,"And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:"
Ephesians,2,7,That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,2,8,For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Ephesians,2,9,"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
Ephesians,2,11,"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
Ephesians,2,12,"That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:"
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians,2,14,"For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;"
Ephesians,2,15,"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;"
Ephesians,2,16,"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:"
Ephesians,2,17,"And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh."
Ephesians,2,18,For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
Ephesians,2,20,"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"
Ephesians,2,21,In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
Ephesians,2,22,In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
Ephesians,3,2,If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
Ephesians,3,3,"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"
Ephesians,3,4,"Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
Ephesians,3,5,"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
Ephesians,3,6,"That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
Ephesians,3,7,"Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
Ephesians,3,8,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
Ephesians,3,9,"And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
Ephesians,3,10,"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
Ephesians,3,11,According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Ephesians,3,12,In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
Ephesians,3,13,"Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Ephesians,3,15,"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
Ephesians,3,16,"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
Ephesians,3,17,"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,"
Ephesians,3,18,"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
Ephesians,3,19,"And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,"
Ephesians,3,21,"Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
Ephesians,4,1,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,"
Ephesians,4,2,"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
Ephesians,4,3,Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;"
Ephesians,4,5,"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
Ephesians,4,6,"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
Ephesians,4,7,But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians,4,8,"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
Ephesians,4,9,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
Ephesians,4,12,"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
Ephesians,4,13,"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:"
Ephesians,4,14,"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
Ephesians,4,15,"But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:"
Ephesians,4,16,"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
Ephesians,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
Ephesians,4,18,"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
Ephesians,4,19,"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
Ephesians,4,20,But ye have not so learned Christ;
Ephesians,4,21,"If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
Ephesians,4,22,"That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
Ephesians,4,23,And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
Ephesians,4,24,"And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
Ephesians,4,25,"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
Ephesians,4,26,"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
Ephesians,4,27,Neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians,4,28,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
Ephesians,4,30,"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
Ephesians,4,32,"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
Ephesians,5,2,"And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
Ephesians,5,3,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;"
Ephesians,5,4,"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
Ephesians,5,6,Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
Ephesians,5,7,Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
Ephesians,5,8,"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
Ephesians,5,9,(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
Ephesians,5,10,Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
Ephesians,5,12,For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
Ephesians,5,14,"Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
Ephesians,5,15,"See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
Ephesians,5,16,"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
Ephesians,5,18,"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
Ephesians,5,19,"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
Ephesians,5,20,Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Ephesians,5,21,Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
Ephesians,5,24,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
Ephesians,5,26,"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
Ephesians,5,27,"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
Ephesians,5,28,So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
Ephesians,5,29,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:"
Ephesians,5,30,"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
Ephesians,5,31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
Ephesians,5,32,This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
Ephesians,5,33,Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;
Ephesians,6,3,"That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."
Ephesians,6,4,"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
Ephesians,6,6,"Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
Ephesians,6,7,"With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
Ephesians,6,8,"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
Ephesians,6,12,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
Ephesians,6,13,"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
Ephesians,6,15,And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians,6,16,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
Ephesians,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
Ephesians,6,18,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
Ephesians,6,19,"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
Ephesians,6,20,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
Ephesians,6,21,"But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
Ephesians,6,22,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
Philippians,1,2,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
Philippians,1,3,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
Philippians,1,4,"Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,"
Philippians,1,5,For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
Philippians,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"
Philippians,1,7,"Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace."
Philippians,1,8,"For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ."
Philippians,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;"
Philippians,1,10,That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.
Philippians,1,11,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God."
Philippians,1,12,"But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;"
Philippians,1,13,"So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;"
Philippians,1,14,"And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
Philippians,1,15,Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
Philippians,1,16,"The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
Philippians,1,17,"But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel."
Philippians,1,18,"What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice."
Philippians,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
Philippians,1,20,"According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death."
Philippians,1,21,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
Philippians,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not."
Philippians,1,23,"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:"
Philippians,1,24,Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
Philippians,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
Philippians,1,26,That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
Philippians,1,27,"Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
Philippians,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God."
Philippians,1,29,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;"
Philippians,1,30,"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
Philippians,2,1,"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, "
Philippians,2,2,"Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. "
Philippians,2,3,Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 
Philippians,2,4,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. "
Philippians,2,5,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: "
Philippians,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: "
Philippians,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: "
Philippians,2,8,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. "
Philippians,2,9,"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: "
Philippians,2,10,"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; "
Philippians,2,11,"And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. "
Philippians,2,12,"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. "
Philippians,2,13,For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. 
Philippians,2,14,Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 
Philippians,2,15,"That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; "
Philippians,2,16,"Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. "
Philippians,2,17,"Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. "
Philippians,2,18,"For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. "
Philippians,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. "
Philippians,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. "
Philippians,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. "
Philippians,2,22,"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. "
Philippians,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. "
Philippians,2,24,But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 
Philippians,2,25,"Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. "
Philippians,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. "
Philippians,2,27,"For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. "
Philippians,2,28,"I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. "
Philippians,2,29,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 
Philippians,2,30,"Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe. "
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. "
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. "
Philippians,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: "
Philippians,3,5,"Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; "
Philippians,3,6,"Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. "
Philippians,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. "
Philippians,3,8,"Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, "
Philippians,3,9,"And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: "
Philippians,3,10,"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; "
Philippians,3,11,If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. 
Philippians,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. "
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, "
Philippians,3,14,I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
Philippians,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. "
Philippians,3,16,"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. "
Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example. "
Philippians,3,18,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: "
Philippians,3,19,"Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) "
Philippians,3,20,"For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: "
Philippians,3,21,"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. "
Philippians,4,2,"I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. "
Philippians,4,3,"And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life. "
Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. "
Philippians,4,5,Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 
Philippians,4,6,Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
Philippians,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. "
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. "
Philippians,4,9,"Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. "
Philippians,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. "
Philippians,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. "
Philippians,4,12,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. "
Philippians,4,13,I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
Philippians,4,14,"Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. "
Philippians,4,15,"Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. "
Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 
Philippians,4,17,Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 
Philippians,4,18,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. "
Philippians,4,19,But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 
Philippians,4,20,Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
Philippians,4,21,Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. 
Philippians,4,22,"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. "
Philippians,4,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Colossians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,"
Colossians,1,2,"To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Colossians,1,3,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
Colossians,1,4,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,"
Colossians,1,5,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
Colossians,1,6,"Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:"
Colossians,1,7,"As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
Colossians,1,8,Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians,1,9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
Colossians,1,10,"That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
Colossians,1,11,"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
Colossians,1,12,"Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
Colossians,1,13,"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:"
Colossians,1,14,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:"
Colossians,1,15,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:"
Colossians,1,16,"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
Colossians,1,17,"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."
Colossians,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."
Colossians,1,19,For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
Colossians,1,20,"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven."
Colossians,1,21,"And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled"
Colossians,1,22,"In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:"
Colossians,1,23,"If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;"
Colossians,1,24,"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:"
Colossians,1,25,"Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"
Colossians,1,26,"Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"
Colossians,1,27,"To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"
Colossians,1,28,"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
Colossians,1,29,"Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily."
Colossians,2,1,"For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
Colossians,2,2,"That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
Colossians,2,3,In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians,2,4,"And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
Colossians,2,5,"For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ."
Colossians,2,6,"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:"
Colossians,2,7,"Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
Colossians,2,8,"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
Colossians,2,9,For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
Colossians,2,10,"And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:"
Colossians,2,11,"In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
Colossians,2,12,"Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead."
Colossians,2,13,"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
Colossians,2,14,"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
Colossians,2,15,"And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
Colossians,2,16,"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:"
Colossians,2,17,Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
Colossians,2,18,"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
Colossians,2,19,"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."
Colossians,2,20,"Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"
Colossians,2,21,(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
Colossians,2,22,Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
Colossians,2,23,"Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."
Colossians,3,1,"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
Colossians,3,2,"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
Colossians,3,3,"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
Colossians,3,4,"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
Colossians,3,6,For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
Colossians,3,7,"In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them."
Colossians,3,8,"But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
Colossians,3,9,"Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;"
Colossians,3,10,"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
Colossians,3,11,"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
Colossians,3,12,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
Colossians,3,13,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."
Colossians,3,14,"And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."
Colossians,3,15,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful."
Colossians,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
Colossians,3,17,"And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."
Colossians,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord."
Colossians,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."
Colossians,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."
Colossians,3,21,"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
Colossians,3,22,"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;"
Colossians,3,23,"And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
Colossians,3,24,Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians,3,25,But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
Colossians,4,1,"Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven."
Colossians,4,2,"Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;"
Colossians,4,3,"Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:"
Colossians,4,4,"That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
Colossians,4,5,"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man."
Colossians,4,6,"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:"
Colossians,4,7,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;"
Colossians,4,8,"With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here."
Colossians,4,9,"0Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)"
Colossians,4,10,"And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me."
Colossians,4,11,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
Colossians,4,12,"For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis."
Colossians,4,13,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."
Colossians,4,14,"Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house."
Colossians,4,15,"And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
Colossians,4,16,"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it."
Colossians,4,17,The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
Colossians,4,18,Scripture not loaded.
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
1 Thessalonians,1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God."
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost."
1 Thessalonians,1,7,So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."
1 Thessalonians,1,9,"For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:"
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,"For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:"
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:"
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,"Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"
1 Thessalonians,2,11,"As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,12,"That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory."
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:"
1 Thessalonians,2,15,"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
1 Thessalonians,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,For ye are our glory and joy.
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
1 Thessalonians,3,2,"And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
1 Thessalonians,3,3,That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:"
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"
1 Thessalonians,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
1 Thessalonians,3,11,"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."
1 Thessalonians,3,12,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:"
1 Thessalonians,3,13,"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:"
1 Thessalonians,4,4,That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
1 Thessalonians,4,5,"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:"
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
1 Thessalonians,4,12,"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing."
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
1 Thessalonians,4,17,"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,8,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."
1 Thessalonians,5,9,"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
1 Thessalonians,5,13,And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Rejoice evermore.
1 Thessalonians,5,17,Pray without ceasing.
1 Thessalonians,5,18,In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Quench not the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians,5,20,Despise not prophesyings.
1 Thessalonians,5,21,Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
1 Thessalonians,5,22,Abstain from all appearance of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"
2 Thessalonians,1,4,So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
2 Thessalonians,1,5,"Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:"
2 Thessalonians,1,6,Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
2 Thessalonians,1,9,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
2 Thessalonians,2,6,And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
2 Thessalonians,2,7,"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
2 Thessalonians,2,12,"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,"Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;"
1 Timothy,1,2,"Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
1 Timothy,1,4,"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
1 Timothy,1,5,"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"
1 Timothy,1,6,From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
1 Timothy,1,7,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;"
1 Timothy,1,9,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
1 Timothy,1,10,"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
1 Timothy,1,11,"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
1 Timothy,1,12,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
1 Timothy,1,13,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
1 Timothy,1,14,And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,1,15,"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
1 Timothy,1,16,"Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;"
1 Timothy,1,19,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
1 Timothy,1,20,"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
1 Timothy,2,2,"For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
1 Timothy,2,3,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
1 Timothy,2,4,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
1 Timothy,2,6,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
1 Timothy,2,7,"Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
1 Timothy,2,8,"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
1 Timothy,2,9,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
1 Timothy,2,10,But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
1 Timothy,2,11,Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
1 Timothy,2,12,"But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
1 Timothy,2,15,"Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,"This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
1 Timothy,3,3,"Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
1 Timothy,3,4,"One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
1 Timothy,3,5,"(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1 Timothy,3,8,"Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"
1 Timothy,3,9,Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."
1 Timothy,3,11,"Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
1 Timothy,3,13,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,3,14,"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:"
1 Timothy,3,15,"But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
1 Timothy,4,2,Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
1 Timothy,4,3,"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."
1 Timothy,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
1 Timothy,4,5,For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained."
1 Timothy,4,7,"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness."
1 Timothy,4,8,"For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
1 Timothy,4,10,"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,These things command and teach.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
1 Timothy,4,15,Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
1 Timothy,4,16,"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;"
1 Timothy,5,2,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."
1 Timothy,5,6,But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
1 Timothy,5,7,"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
1 Timothy,5,9,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man."
1 Timothy,5,10,"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
1 Timothy,5,12,"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
1 Timothy,5,13,"And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
1 Timothy,5,14,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
1 Timothy,5,15,For some are already turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
1 Timothy,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward."
1 Timothy,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
1 Timothy,5,20,"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after."
1 Timothy,5,25,Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."
1 Timothy,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
1 Timothy,6,3,"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
1 Timothy,6,4,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
1 Timothy,6,5,"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
1 Timothy,6,8,And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
1 Timothy,6,9,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses."
1 Timothy,6,13,"I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"
1 Timothy,6,14,"That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
1 Timothy,6,15,"Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
1 Timothy,6,16,"Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;"
1 Timothy,6,18,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
1 Timothy,6,19,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"
1 Timothy,6,21,Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;"
2 Timothy,1,4,"Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
2 Timothy,1,5,"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also."
2 Timothy,1,6,"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
2 Timothy,1,9,"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
2 Timothy,1,10,"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
2 Timothy,1,11,"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
2 Timothy,1,12,"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
2 Timothy,1,15,"This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"
2 Timothy,1,17,"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."
2 Timothy,1,18,"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."
2 Timothy,2,1,"Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
2 Timothy,2,3,"Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."
2 Timothy,2,4,No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
2 Timothy,2,5,"And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully."
2 Timothy,2,6,The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
2 Timothy,2,7,Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy,2,8,Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
2 Timothy,2,9,"Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."
2 Timothy,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
2 Timothy,2,17,And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
2 Timothy,2,18,"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
2 Timothy,2,20,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."
2 Timothy,2,21,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."
2 Timothy,2,24,"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"
2 Timothy,2,25,In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
2 Timothy,2,26,"And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
2 Timothy,3,4,"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
2 Timothy,3,5,"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
2 Timothy,3,6,"For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,"
2 Timothy,3,7,"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
2 Timothy,3,8,"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was."
2 Timothy,3,10,"But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,"
2 Timothy,3,11,"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."
2 Timothy,3,12,"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
2 Timothy,3,13,"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;"
2 Timothy,3,15,"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,3,16,"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
2 Timothy,3,17,"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
2 Timothy,4,2,"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"
2 Timothy,4,4,"And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."
2 Timothy,4,5,"But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:"
2 Timothy,4,8,"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
2 Timothy,4,10,"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."
2 Timothy,4,12,And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
2 Timothy,4,15,Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."
2 Timothy,4,17,"Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
2 Timothy,4,18,"And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
2 Timothy,4,19,"Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
2 Timothy,4,20,Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
2 Timothy,4,21,"Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
Titus,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
Titus,1,2,"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
Titus,1,3,"But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
Titus,1,4,"To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
Titus,1,5,"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"
Titus,1,6,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
Titus,1,7,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"
Titus,1,8,"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
Titus,1,9,"Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."
Titus,1,10,"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
Titus,1,11,"Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."
Titus,1,12,"One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
Titus,1,13,"This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
Titus,1,14,"Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
Titus,1,15,Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
Titus,1,16,"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
Titus,2,1,But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
Titus,2,2,"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."
Titus,2,3,"The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
Titus,2,4,"That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
Titus,2,5,"To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."
Titus,2,6,Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
Titus,2,7,"In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"
Titus,2,8,"Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
Titus,2,9,"Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;"
Titus,2,10,"Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,"
Titus,2,12,"Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
Titus,2,13,"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"
Titus,2,14,"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
Titus,2,15,"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee."
Titus,3,1,"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
Titus,3,2,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."
Titus,3,3,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
Titus,3,4,"But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"
Titus,3,6,Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus,3,7,"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
Titus,3,8,"This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
Titus,3,10,A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
Titus,3,11,"Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself."
Titus,3,12,"When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."
Titus,3,13,"Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."
Titus,3,14,"And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
Philemon,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
Philemon,1,2,"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"
Philemon,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Philemon,1,4,"I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,"
Philemon,1,5,"Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
Philemon,1,6,That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
Philemon,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."
Philemon,1,8,"Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"
Philemon,1,9,"Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
Philemon,1,10,"I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
Philemon,1,11,"Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:"
Philemon,1,12,"Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"
Philemon,1,13,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
Philemon,1,14,"But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
Philemon,1,15,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"
Philemon,1,16,"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
Philemon,1,17,"If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
Philemon,1,18,"If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;"
Philemon,1,19,"I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."
Philemon,1,20,"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."
Philemon,1,21,"Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."
Philemon,1,22,But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
Philemon,1,23,"There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;"
Philemon,1,24,"Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."
Philemon,1,25,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Hebrews,1,1,"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
Hebrews,1,2,"Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
Hebrews,1,3,"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:"
Hebrews,1,4,"Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him."
Hebrews,1,7,"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
Hebrews,1,8,"But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."
Hebrews,1,9,"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
Hebrews,1,10,"And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:"
Hebrews,1,11,They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
Hebrews,1,12,"And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
Hebrews,1,13,"But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
Hebrews,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip."
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;"
Hebrews,2,3,"How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;"
Hebrews,2,4,"God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"
Hebrews,2,5,"For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
Hebrews,2,6,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?"
Hebrews,2,7,"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:"
Hebrews,2,8,"Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
Hebrews,2,11,"For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
Hebrews,2,12,"Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee."
Hebrews,2,13,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me."
Hebrews,2,14,"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
Hebrews,2,15,And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews,2,16,For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews,2,17,"Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"
Hebrews,3,2,"Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house."
Hebrews,3,3,"For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.
Hebrews,3,5,"And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"
Hebrews,3,6,"But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
Hebrews,3,7,"Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,"
Hebrews,3,8,"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"
Hebrews,3,9,"When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways."
Hebrews,3,11,"So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"
Hebrews,3,12,"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."
Hebrews,3,13,"But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
Hebrews,3,14,"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;"
Hebrews,3,15,"While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
Hebrews,3,16,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
Hebrews,3,17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews,4,1,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,"For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."
Hebrews,4,5,"And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest."
Hebrews,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
Hebrews,4,7,"Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
Hebrews,4,9,There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
Hebrews,4,10,"For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his."
Hebrews,4,11,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
Hebrews,5,2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."
Hebrews,5,3,"And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
Hebrews,5,4,"And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."
Hebrews,5,5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee."
Hebrews,5,6,"As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
Hebrews,5,8,"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
Hebrews,5,9,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
Hebrews,5,10,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."
Hebrews,5,13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
Hebrews,5,14,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
Hebrews,6,2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,"And this will we do, if God permit."
Hebrews,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,"
Hebrews,6,5,"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,"
Hebrews,6,6,"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."
Hebrews,6,7,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:"
Hebrews,6,8,"But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
Hebrews,6,10,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
Hebrews,6,11,And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
Hebrews,6,12,"That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,"
Hebrews,6,14,"Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
Hebrews,6,17,"Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:"
Hebrews,6,18,"That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
Hebrews,6,19,"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;"
Hebrews,6,20,"Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
Hebrews,7,2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."
Hebrews,7,5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:"
Hebrews,7,6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
Hebrews,7,7,And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
Hebrews,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth."
Hebrews,7,9,"And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."
Hebrews,7,10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him."
Hebrews,7,11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
Hebrews,7,13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
Hebrews,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,"
Hebrews,7,16,"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
Hebrews,7,17,"For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,7,18,For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
Hebrews,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God."
Hebrews,7,20,And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
Hebrews,7,21,"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
Hebrews,7,22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
Hebrews,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
Hebrews,7,24,"But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
Hebrews,7,27,"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
Hebrews,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
Hebrews,8,5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."
Hebrews,8,6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
Hebrews,9,4,"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
Hebrews,9,5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God."
Hebrews,9,7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:"
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
Hebrews,9,9,"Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
Hebrews,9,10,"Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
Hebrews,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:"
Hebrews,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
Hebrews,9,16,"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
Hebrews,9,17,For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
Hebrews,9,18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
Hebrews,9,20,"Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you."
Hebrews,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
Hebrews,9,22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
Hebrews,9,23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
Hebrews,9,26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
Hebrews,9,28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
Hebrews,10,2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
Hebrews,10,4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"
Hebrews,10,6,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."
Hebrews,10,8,"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;"
Hebrews,10,9,"Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
Hebrews,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
Hebrews,10,13,From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15,"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
Hebrews,10,16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."
Hebrews,10,19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
Hebrews,10,20,"By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
Hebrews,10,21,And having an high priest over the house of God;
Hebrews,10,22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
Hebrews,10,24,And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
Hebrews,10,25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."
Hebrews,10,26,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,"
Hebrews,10,27,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
Hebrews,10,28,He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
Hebrews,10,29,"Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people."
Hebrews,10,31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;"
Hebrews,10,33,"Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used."
Hebrews,10,34,"For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
Hebrews,10,35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."
Hebrews,10,36,"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise."
Hebrews,10,37,"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry."
Hebrews,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
Hebrews,10,39,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Hebrews,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
Hebrews,11,6,"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."
Hebrews,11,9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"
Hebrews,11,10,"For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
Hebrews,11,11,"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
Hebrews,11,12,"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."
Hebrews,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
Hebrews,11,14,For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
Hebrews,11,15,"And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
Hebrews,11,16,"But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"
Hebrews,11,18,"Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:"
Hebrews,11,19,"Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure."
Hebrews,11,20,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff."
Hebrews,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."
Hebrews,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."
Hebrews,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"
Hebrews,11,25,"Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
Hebrews,11,26,Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
Hebrews,11,27,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
Hebrews,11,28,"Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
Hebrews,11,29,By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
Hebrews,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."
Hebrews,11,31,"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."
Hebrews,11,32,"And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:"
Hebrews,11,33,"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions."
Hebrews,11,34,"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
Hebrews,11,36,"And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
Hebrews,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
Hebrews,11,38,"(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."
Hebrews,11,39,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
Hebrews,11,40,"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
Hebrews,12,1,"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
Hebrews,12,2,"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."
Hebrews,12,4,"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
Hebrews,12,5,"And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:"
Hebrews,12,6,"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
Hebrews,12,7,"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
Hebrews,12,8,"But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."
Hebrews,12,9,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
Hebrews,12,10,"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."
Hebrews,12,11,"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."
Hebrews,12,12,"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"
Hebrews,12,13,"And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."
Hebrews,12,14,"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"
Hebrews,12,15,"Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"
Hebrews,12,16,"Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright."
Hebrews,12,17,"For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
Hebrews,12,18,"For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
Hebrews,12,19,"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
Hebrews,12,20,"(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"
Hebrews,12,21,"And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"
Hebrews,12,22,"But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"
Hebrews,12,23,"To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
Hebrews,12,24,"And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:"
Hebrews,12,26,"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."
Hebrews,12,27,"And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."
Hebrews,12,28,"Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:"
Hebrews,12,29,For our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews,13,1,Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews,13,2,Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
Hebrews,13,3,"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
Hebrews,13,4,"Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."
Hebrews,13,5,"Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
Hebrews,13,6,"So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
Hebrews,13,7,"Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation."
Hebrews,13,8,"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever."
Hebrews,13,9,"Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein."
Hebrews,13,10,"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."
Hebrews,13,11,"For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp."
Hebrews,13,12,"Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."
Hebrews,13,13,"Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach."
Hebrews,13,14,"For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."
Hebrews,13,15,"By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."
Hebrews,13,16,But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Hebrews,13,17,"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you."
Hebrews,13,18,"Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly."
Hebrews,13,19,"But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
Hebrews,13,20,"Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
Hebrews,13,21,"Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
Hebrews,13,22,"And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."
Hebrews,13,23,"Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you."
Hebrews,13,24,"Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you."
Hebrews,13,25,Grace be with you all. Amen.
James,1,1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."
James,1,2,"My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;"
James,1,3,"Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience."
James,1,4,"But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
James,1,5,"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
James,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
James,1,7,For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
James,1,8,A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
James,1,9,Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
James,1,10,"But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
James,1,11,"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
James,1,12,"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."
James,1,13,"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:"
James,1,14,"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
James,1,15,"Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."
James,1,16,"Do not err, my beloved brethren."
James,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
James,1,18,"Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
James,1,19,"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"
James,1,20,For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
James,1,21,"Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
James,1,22,"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
James,1,23,"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"
James,1,24,"For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was."
James,1,25,"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continuetrueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
James,1,26,"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain."
James,1,27,"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."
James,2,1,"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons."
James,2,2,"For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;"
James,2,3,"And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:"
James,2,4,"Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
James,2,5,"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
James,2,6,"But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
James,2,7,Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
James,2,8,"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:"
James,2,9,"But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
James,2,10,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
James,2,11,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."
James,2,12,"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
James,2,13,"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."
James,2,14,"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
James,2,15,"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
James,2,16,"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?"
James,2,17,"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."
James,2,18,"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
James,2,19,"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."
James,2,20,"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
James,2,21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
James,2,22,"Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
James,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
James,2,24,"Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
James,2,25,"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"
James,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
James,3,1,"My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."
James,3,2,"For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."
James,3,3,"Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
James,3,4,"Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth."
James,3,5,"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"
James,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
James,3,7,"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:"
James,3,8,"But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
James,3,9,"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."
James,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
James,3,11,Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
James,3,12,"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
James,3,13,Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
James,3,14,"But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."
James,3,15,"This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."
James,3,16,"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
James,3,18,And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
James,4,1,"From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"
James,4,2,"Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not."
James,4,3,"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts."
James,4,4,"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
James,4,5,"Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
James,4,6,"But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
James,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
James,4,8,"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded."
James,4,9,"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."
James,4,11,"Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge."
James,4,12,"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"
James,4,13,"Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
James,4,14,"Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
James,4,15,"For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."
James,4,16,But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
James,4,17,"Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."
James,5,1,"Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you."
James,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten."
James,5,3,"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days."
James,5,4,"Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."
James,5,5,"Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
James,5,6,Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
James,5,7,"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
James,5,8,Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
James,5,9,"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door."
James,5,10,"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
James,5,11,"Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."
James,5,12,"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation."
James,5,13,Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
James,5,14,"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
James,5,15,"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
James,5,16,"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."
James,5,17,"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."
James,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."
James,5,19,"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
James,5,20,"Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
1 Peter,1,2,"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
1 Peter,1,4,"To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
1 Peter,1,5,Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"
1 Peter,1,7,"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
1 Peter,1,8,"Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
1 Peter,1,9,"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:"
1 Peter,1,11,"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
1 Peter,1,12,"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
1 Peter,1,13,"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
1 Peter,1,14,"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
1 Peter,1,15,"But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;"
1 Peter,1,16,"Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."
1 Peter,1,17,"And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:"
1 Peter,1,18,"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;"
1 Peter,1,19,"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
1 Peter,1,20,"Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
1 Peter,1,21,"Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
1 Peter,1,23,"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever."
1 Peter,1,24,"For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:"
1 Peter,1,25,But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
1 Peter,2,1,"Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,"
1 Peter,2,2,"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:"
1 Peter,2,3,If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
1 Peter,2,4,"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,"
1 Peter,2,5,"Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
1 Peter,2,7,"Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"
1 Peter,2,8,"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;"
1 Peter,2,10,"Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
1 Peter,2,12,"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."
1 Peter,2,13,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
1 Peter,2,14,"Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
1 Peter,2,15,"For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
1 Peter,2,16,"As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."
1 Peter,2,17,Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."
1 Peter,2,19,"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
1 Peter,2,20,"For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."
1 Peter,2,21,"For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:"
1 Peter,2,22,"Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
1 Peter,2,23,"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:"
1 Peter,2,24,"Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."
1 Peter,2,25,For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1 Peter,3,1,"Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;"
1 Peter,3,2,While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
1 Peter,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
1 Peter,3,4,"But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
1 Peter,3,5,"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
1 Peter,3,6,"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."
1 Peter,3,7,"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:"
1 Peter,3,9,"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
1 Peter,3,11,"Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."
1 Peter,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."
1 Peter,3,13,"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?"
1 Peter,3,14,"But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"
1 Peter,3,15,But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
1 Peter,3,16,"Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ."
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:"
1 Peter,3,19,By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
1 Peter,3,20,"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
1 Peter,3,21,"The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"
1 Peter,3,22,"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;"
1 Peter,4,2,"That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
1 Peter,4,3,"For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:"
1 Peter,4,4,"Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:"
1 Peter,4,5,Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
1 Peter,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."
1 Peter,4,8,And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
1 Peter,4,9,Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
1 Peter,4,10,"As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
1 Peter,4,11,"If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
1 Peter,4,13,"But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."
1 Peter,4,14,"If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
1 Peter,4,15,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."
1 Peter,4,16,"Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
1 Peter,4,17,"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
1 Peter,4,18,"And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
1 Peter,4,19,"Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
1 Peter,5,1,"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
1 Peter,5,2,"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;"
1 Peter,5,3,"Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."
1 Peter,5,5,"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."
1 Peter,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
1 Peter,5,7,Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
1 Peter,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"
1 Peter,5,9,"Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
1 Peter,5,10,"But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you."
1 Peter,5,11,To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand."
1 Peter,5,13,"The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son."
1 Peter,5,14,Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Peter,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"
2 Peter,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
2 Peter,1,3,"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:"
2 Peter,1,4,"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
2 Peter,1,5,"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
2 Peter,1,6,And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
2 Peter,1,7,And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
2 Peter,1,8,"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,9,"But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
2 Peter,1,10,"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:"
2 Peter,1,11,For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2 Peter,1,12,"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth."
2 Peter,1,13,"Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;"
2 Peter,1,14,"Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."
2 Peter,1,15,Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
2 Peter,1,16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
2 Peter,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
2 Peter,1,18,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
2 Peter,1,19,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
2 Peter,1,20,"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
2 Peter,1,21,For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
2 Peter,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
2 Peter,2,2,And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
2 Peter,2,3,"And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
2 Peter,2,5,"And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,6,"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,7,"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:"
2 Peter,2,8,"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)"
2 Peter,2,9,"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
2 Peter,2,10,"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."
2 Peter,2,11,"Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
2 Peter,2,13,"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
2 Peter,2,14,"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
2 Peter,2,15,"Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
2 Peter,2,16,But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
2 Peter,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."
2 Peter,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."
2 Peter,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
2 Peter,2,20,"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
2 Peter,2,21,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
2 Peter,2,22,"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
2 Peter,3,1,"This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
2 Peter,3,2,"That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"
2 Peter,3,3,"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
2 Peter,3,4,"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
2 Peter,3,5,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
2 Peter,3,6,"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
2 Peter,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
2 Peter,3,8,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
2 Peter,3,11,"Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,"
2 Peter,3,12,"Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
2 Peter,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
2 Peter,3,14,"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
2 Peter,3,15,And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
2 Peter,3,16,"As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
2 Peter,3,17,"Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness."
2 Peter,3,18,"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen."
1 John,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
1 John,1,2,"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"
1 John,1,3,"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
1 John,1,5,"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
1 John,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
1 John,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
1 John,2,2,"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
1 John,2,3,"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
1 John,2,4,"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
1 John,2,5,"But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."
1 John,2,6,"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
1 John,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning."
1 John,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth."
1 John,2,9,"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."
1 John,2,10,"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him."
1 John,2,11,"But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."
1 John,2,13,"I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father."
1 John,2,14,"I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one."
1 John,2,15,"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
1 John,2,16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."
1 John,2,17,"And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."
1 John,2,18,"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
1 John,2,20,"But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things."
1 John,2,21,"I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
1 John,2,22,"Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son."
1 John,2,23,"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also."
1 John,2,24,"Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,"And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life."
1 John,2,26,These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.
1 John,2,27,"But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."
1 John,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
1 John,2,29,"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him."
1 John,3,1,"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not."
1 John,3,2,"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
1 John,3,3,"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
1 John,3,4,Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
1 John,3,5,And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
1 John,3,6,"Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him."
1 John,3,7,"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
1 John,3,8,"He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
1 John,3,9,"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
1 John,3,10,"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother."
1 John,3,11,"For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
1 John,3,12,"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."
1 John,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death."
1 John,3,15,Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
1 John,3,16,"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
1 John,3,17,"But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"
1 John,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
1 John,3,19,"And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
1 John,3,20,"For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."
1 John,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God."
1 John,3,22,"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
1 John,3,23,"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
1 John,3,24,"And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us."
1 John,4,1,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
1 John,4,3,"And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."
1 John,4,4,"Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them."
1 John,4,6,"We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
1 John,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."
1 John,4,8,He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
1 John,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
1 John,4,10,"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us."
1 John,4,13,"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit."
1 John,4,14,And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
1 John,4,15,"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God."
1 John,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."
1 John,4,17,"Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
1 John,4,18,There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
1 John,4,19,"We love him, because he first loved us."
1 John,4,20,"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"
1 John,4,21,"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."
1 John,5,1,Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
1 John,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."
1 John,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
1 John,5,4,"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."
1 John,5,5,"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
1 John,5,6,"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth."
1 John,5,7,"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."
1 John,5,8,"And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
1 John,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son."
1 John,5,10,He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
1 John,5,11,"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
1 John,5,12,He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
1 John,5,13,"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God."
1 John,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:"
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him."
1 John,5,16,"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."
1 John,5,17,All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1 John,5,18,"We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."
1 John,5,19,"And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness."
1 John,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
2 John,1,1,"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
2 John,1,2,"For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever."
2 John,1,3,"Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
2 John,1,5,"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it."
2 John,1,7,"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."
2 John,1,8,"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,"Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son."
2 John,1,10,"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:"
2 John,1,11,For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
2 John,1,12,"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
2 John,1,13,The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
3 John,1,1,"The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
3 John,1,2,"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
3 John,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth."
3 John,1,4,I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
3 John,1,5,"Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;"

Revelation,19,18,"That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."
Revelation,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."
Revelation,19,20,"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
Revelation,19,21,"And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."
Revelation,20,1,"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
Revelation,20,2,"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,"
Revelation,20,3,"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."
Revelation,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
Revelation,20,5,But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation,20,6,"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
Revelation,20,7,"And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,"
Revelation,20,8,"And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea."
Revelation,20,9,"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
Revelation,20,10,"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
Revelation,20,11,"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."
Revelation,20,12,"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."
Revelation,20,13,And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
Revelation,20,14,And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
Revelation,20,15,And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
Revelation,21,1,And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
Revelation,21,2,"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
Revelation,21,3,"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God."
Revelation,21,4,"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
Revelation,21,5,"And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."
Revelation,21,6,"And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
Revelation,21,7,"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son."
Revelation,21,8,"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
Revelation,21,9,"And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife."
Revelation,21,10,"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,"
Revelation,21,11,"Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;"
Revelation,21,12,"And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:"
Revelation,21,13,On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
Revelation,21,14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
Revelation,21,15,"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof."
Revelation,21,16,"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
Revelation,21,17,"And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel."
Revelation,21,18,"And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass."
Revelation,21,19,"And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;"
Revelation,21,20,"The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst."
Revelation,21,21,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass."
Revelation,21,22,And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
Revelation,21,23,"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof."
Revelation,21,24,And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
Revelation,21,25,And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
Revelation,21,26,And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
Revelation,21,27,"And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life."
Revelation,22,1,"And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."
Revelation,22,2,"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
Revelation,22,3,And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
Revelation,22,4,And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.
Revelation,22,5,"And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever."
Revelation,22,6,"And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done."
Revelation,22,7,"Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book."
Revelation,22,8,"And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things."
Revelation,22,9,"Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God."
Revelation,22,10,"And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."
Revelation,22,11,"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."
Revelation,22,12,"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."
Revelation,22,13,"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."
Revelation,22,14,"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."
Revelation,22,15,"For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie."
Revelation,22,16,"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star."
Revelation,22,17,"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
Revelation,22,18,"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:"
Revelation,22,19,"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."
Revelation,22,20,"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
Revelation,22,21,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Matthew,1,1,"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
Matthew,1,2,Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 
Matthew,1,3,And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 
Matthew,1,4,And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 
Matthew,1,5,And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
Matthew,1,6,And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 
Matthew,1,7,And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 
Matthew,1,8,And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 
Matthew,1,9,And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; 
Matthew,1,10,And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; 
Matthew,1,11,"And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: "
Matthew,1,12,"And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; "
Matthew,1,13,And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 
Matthew,1,14,And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
Matthew,1,15,And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 
Matthew,1,16,"And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. "
Matthew,1,17,So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. 
Matthew,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. "
Matthew,1,19,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. "
Matthew,1,20,"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. "
Matthew,1,21,"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. "
Matthew,1,22,"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, "
Matthew,1,23,"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. "
Matthew,1,24,"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: "
Matthew,1,25,And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
Matthew,2,1,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, "
Matthew,2,2,"Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. "
Matthew,2,3,"When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. "
Matthew,2,4,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. "
Matthew,2,5,"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, "
Matthew,2,6,"And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. "
Matthew,2,7,"Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. "
Matthew,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. "
Matthew,2,9,"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. "
Matthew,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. "
Matthew,2,11,"And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh. "
Matthew,2,12,"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. "
Matthew,2,13,"And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. "
Matthew,2,14,"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: "
Matthew,2,15,"And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. "
Matthew,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. "
Matthew,2,17,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "
Matthew,2,18,"In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. "
Matthew,2,19,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, "
Matthew,2,20,"Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. "
Matthew,2,21,"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. "
Matthew,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: "
Matthew,2,23,"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."
Matthew,3,1,"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,"
Matthew,3,2,"And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. "
Matthew,3,3,"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. "
Matthew,3,4,"And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. "
Matthew,3,5,"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, "
Matthew,3,6,"And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. "
Matthew,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? "
Matthew,3,8,Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 
Matthew,3,9,"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. "
Matthew,3,10,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. "
Matthew,3,11,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: "
Matthew,3,12,"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. "
Matthew,3,13,"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. "
Matthew,3,14,"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? "
Matthew,3,15,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. "
Matthew,3,16,"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: "
Matthew,3,17,"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Matthew,4,1,Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. 
Matthew,4,2,"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. "
Matthew,4,3,"And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. "
Matthew,4,4,"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. "
Matthew,4,5,"Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, "
Matthew,4,6,"And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. "
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. "
Matthew,4,8,"Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; "
Matthew,4,9,"And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. "
Matthew,4,10,"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. "
Matthew,4,11,"Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. "
Matthew,4,12,"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; "
Matthew,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: "
Matthew,4,14,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, "
Matthew,4,15,"The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; "
Matthew,4,16,The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. 
Matthew,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. "
Matthew,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. "
Matthew,4,19,"And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. "
Matthew,4,20,"And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. "
Matthew,4,21,"And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. "
Matthew,4,22,"And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. "
Matthew,4,23,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. "
Matthew,4,24,"And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. "
Matthew,4,25,"And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan."
Matthew,5,1,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:"
Matthew,5,2,"And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, "
Matthew,5,3,Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Matthew,5,4,Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 
Matthew,5,5,Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 
Matthew,5,6,Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 
Matthew,5,7,Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 
Matthew,5,8,Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 
Matthew,5,9,Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 
Matthew,5,10,Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Matthew,5,11,"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. "
Matthew,5,12,"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. "
Matthew,5,13,"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. "
Matthew,5,14,Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. 
Matthew,5,15,"Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. "
Matthew,5,16,"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,5,17,"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. "
Matthew,5,18,"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. "
Matthew,5,19,"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,5,20,"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,5,21,"Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: "
Matthew,5,22,"But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. "
Matthew,5,23,"Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; "
Matthew,5,24,"Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. "
Matthew,5,25,"Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. "
Matthew,5,26,"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. "
Matthew,5,27,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: "
Matthew,5,28,"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. "
Matthew,5,29,"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. "
Matthew,5,30,"And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. "
Matthew,5,31,"It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: "
Matthew,5,32,"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. "
Matthew,5,33,"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: "
Matthew,5,34,"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: "
Matthew,5,35,Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. 
Matthew,5,36,"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. "
Matthew,5,37,"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. "
Matthew,5,38,"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: "
Matthew,5,39,"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. "
Matthew,5,40,"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. "
Matthew,5,41,"And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. "
Matthew,5,42,"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. "
Matthew,5,43,"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. "
Matthew,5,44,"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; "
Matthew,5,45,"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. "
Matthew,5,46,"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? "
Matthew,5,47,"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? "
Matthew,5,48,"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
Matthew,6,1,"Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,6,2,"Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. "
Matthew,6,3,"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: "
Matthew,6,4,That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. 
Matthew,6,5,"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. "
Matthew,6,6,"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. "
Matthew,6,7,"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. "
Matthew,6,8,"Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. "
Matthew,6,9,"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. "
Matthew,6,10,"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. "
Matthew,6,11,Give us this day our daily bread. 
Matthew,6,12,"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. "
Matthew,6,13,"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. "
Matthew,6,14,"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: "
Matthew,6,15,"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. "
Matthew,6,16,"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. "
Matthew,6,17,"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; "
Matthew,6,18,"That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. "
Matthew,6,19,"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: "
Matthew,6,20,"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: "
Matthew,6,21,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. "
Matthew,6,22,"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. "
Matthew,6,23,"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! "
Matthew,6,24,"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. "
Matthew,6,25,"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? "
Matthew,6,26,"Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? "
Matthew,6,27,Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 
Matthew,6,28,"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: "
Matthew,6,29,"And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. "
Matthew,6,30,"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? "
Matthew,6,31,"Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? "
Matthew,6,32,(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 
Matthew,6,33,"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. "
Matthew,6,34,Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
Matthew,7,1,"Judge not, that ye be not judged. "
Matthew,7,2,"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. "
Matthew,7,3,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? "
Matthew,7,4,"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? "
Matthew,7,5,"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. "
Matthew,7,6,"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. "
Matthew,7,7,"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: "
Matthew,7,8,For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
Matthew,7,9,"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? "
Matthew,7,10,"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? "
Matthew,7,11,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? "
Matthew,7,12,"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. "
Matthew,7,13,"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: "
Matthew,7,14,"Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. "
Matthew,7,15,"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. "
Matthew,7,16,"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? "
Matthew,7,17,Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 
Matthew,7,18,"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. "
Matthew,7,19,"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. "
Matthew,7,20,Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 
Matthew,7,21,"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,7,22,"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? "
Matthew,7,23,"And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. "
Matthew,7,24,"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: "
Matthew,7,25,"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. "
Matthew,7,26,"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: "
Matthew,7,27,"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. "
Matthew,7,28,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: "
Matthew,7,29,"For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
Matthew,8,1,"When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. "
Matthew,8,2,"And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. "
Matthew,8,3,"And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. "
Matthew,8,4,"And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. "
Matthew,8,5,"And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, "
Matthew,8,6,"And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. "
Matthew,8,7,"And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. "
Matthew,8,8,"The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. "
Matthew,8,9,"For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. "
Matthew,8,10,"When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. "
Matthew,8,11,"And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,8,12,But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
Matthew,8,13,"And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. "
Matthew,8,14,"And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever. "
Matthew,8,15,"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. "
Matthew,8,16,"When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: "
Matthew,8,17,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. "
Matthew,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. "
Matthew,8,19,"And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. "
Matthew,8,20,"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. "
Matthew,8,21,"And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. "
Matthew,8,22,"But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. "
Matthew,8,23,"And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. "
Matthew,8,24,"And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. "
Matthew,8,25,"And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. "
Matthew,8,26,"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. "
Matthew,8,27,"But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! "
Matthew,8,28,"And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. "
Matthew,8,29,"And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? "
Matthew,8,30,And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. 
Matthew,8,31,"So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. "
Matthew,8,32,"And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. "
Matthew,8,33,"And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. "
Matthew,8,34,"And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts."
Matthew,9,1,"And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city. "
Matthew,9,2,"And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. "
Matthew,9,3,"And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. "
Matthew,9,4,"And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? "
Matthew,9,5,"For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk? "
Matthew,9,6,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. "
Matthew,9,7,"And he arose, and departed to his house. "
Matthew,9,8,"But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men. "
Matthew,9,9,"And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. "
Matthew,9,10,"And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. "
Matthew,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? "
Matthew,9,12,"But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. "
Matthew,9,13,"But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. "
Matthew,9,14,"Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? "
Matthew,9,15,"And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. "
Matthew,9,16,"No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. "
Matthew,9,17,"Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. "
Matthew,9,18,"While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. "
Matthew,9,19,"And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. "
Matthew,9,20,"And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: "
Matthew,9,21,"For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. "
Matthew,9,22,"But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. "
Matthew,9,23,"And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, "
Matthew,9,24,"He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. "
Matthew,9,25,"But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. "
Matthew,9,26,And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. 
Matthew,9,27,"And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us. "
Matthew,9,28,"And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. "
Matthew,9,29,"Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. "
Matthew,9,30,"And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. "
Matthew,9,31,"But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country. "
Matthew,9,32,"As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. "
Matthew,9,33,"And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. "
Matthew,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. "
Matthew,9,35,"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. "
Matthew,9,36,"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. "
Matthew,9,37,"Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; "
Matthew,9,38,"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
Matthew,10,1,"And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. "
Matthew,10,2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; "
Matthew,10,3,"Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; "
Matthew,10,4,"Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. "
Matthew,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: "
Matthew,10,6,But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
Matthew,10,7,"And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. "
Matthew,10,8,"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. "
Matthew,10,9,"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, "
Matthew,10,10,"Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. "
Matthew,10,11,"And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. "
Matthew,10,12,"And when ye come into an house, salute it. "
Matthew,10,13,"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. "
Matthew,10,14,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. "
Matthew,10,15,"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. "
Matthew,10,16,"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. "
Matthew,10,17,"But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; "
Matthew,10,18,"And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. "
Matthew,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. "
Matthew,10,20,"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. "
Matthew,10,21,"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. "
Matthew,10,22,And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. 
Matthew,10,23,"But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. "
Matthew,10,24,"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. "
Matthew,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? "
Matthew,10,26,"Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. "
Matthew,10,27,"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. "
Matthew,10,28,"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. "
Matthew,10,29,Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 
Matthew,10,30,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
Matthew,10,31,"Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. "
Matthew,10,32,"Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,10,33,"But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,10,34,"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. "
Matthew,10,35,"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. "
Matthew,10,36,And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. 
Matthew,10,37,He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
Matthew,10,38,"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. "
Matthew,10,39,He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. 
Matthew,10,40,"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. "
Matthew,10,41,He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 
Matthew,10,42,"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."
Matthew,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. "
Matthew,11,2,"Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, "
Matthew,11,3,"And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? "
Matthew,11,4,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: "
Matthew,11,5,"The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. "
Matthew,11,6,"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. "
Matthew,11,7,"And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? "
Matthew,11,8,"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. "
Matthew,11,9,"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. "
Matthew,11,10,"For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. "
Matthew,11,11,"Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. "
Matthew,11,12,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. "
Matthew,11,13,For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
Matthew,11,14,"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. "
Matthew,11,15,"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. "
Matthew,11,16,"But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, "
Matthew,11,17,"And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. "
Matthew,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. "
Matthew,11,19,"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. "
Matthew,11,20,"Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: "
Matthew,11,21,"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. "
Matthew,11,22,"But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. "
Matthew,11,23,"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. "
Matthew,11,24,"But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. "
Matthew,11,25,"At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. "
Matthew,11,26,"Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. "
Matthew,11,27,"All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. "
Matthew,11,28,"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. "
Matthew,11,29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. "
Matthew,11,30,"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
Matthew,12,1,"At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat. "
Matthew,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. "
Matthew,12,3,"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; "
Matthew,12,4,"How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? "
Matthew,12,5,"Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? "
Matthew,12,6,"But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. "
Matthew,12,7,"But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. "
Matthew,12,8,For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. 
Matthew,12,9,"And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: "
Matthew,12,10,"And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. "
Matthew,12,11,"And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? "
Matthew,12,12,How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. 
Matthew,12,13,"Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. "
Matthew,12,14,"Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. "
Matthew,12,15,"But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; "
Matthew,12,16,And charged them that they should not make him known: 
Matthew,12,17,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, "
Matthew,12,18,"Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. "
Matthew,12,19,"He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. "
Matthew,12,20,"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. "
Matthew,12,21,And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. 
Matthew,12,22,"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. "
Matthew,12,23,"And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? "
Matthew,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. "
Matthew,12,25,"And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: "
Matthew,12,26,"And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? "
Matthew,12,27,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. "
Matthew,12,28,"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. "
Matthew,12,29,"Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. "
Matthew,12,30,He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. 
Matthew,12,31,"Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. "
Matthew,12,32,"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. "
Matthew,12,33,"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. "
Matthew,12,34,"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. "
Matthew,12,35,A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. 
Matthew,12,36,"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. "
Matthew,12,37,"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. "
Matthew,12,38,"Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. "
Matthew,12,39,"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: "
Matthew,12,40,For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 
Matthew,12,41,"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. "
Matthew,12,42,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. "
Matthew,12,43,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. "
Matthew,12,44,"Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. "
Matthew,12,45,"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. "
Matthew,12,46,"While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. "
Matthew,12,47,"Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. "
Matthew,12,48,"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? "
Matthew,12,49,"And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! "
Matthew,12,50,"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
Matthew,13,1,"The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. "
Matthew,13,2,"And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. "
Matthew,13,3,"And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; "
Matthew,13,4,"And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: "
Matthew,13,5,"Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: "
Matthew,13,6,"And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. "
Matthew,13,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: "
Matthew,13,8,"But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. "
Matthew,13,9,"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. "
Matthew,13,10,"And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? "
Matthew,13,11,"He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. "
Matthew,13,12,"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. "
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. "
Matthew,13,14,"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: "
Matthew,13,15,"For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. "
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. "
Matthew,13,17,"For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. "
Matthew,13,18,Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 
Matthew,13,19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. "
Matthew,13,20,"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; "
Matthew,13,21,"Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. "
Matthew,13,22,"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. "
Matthew,13,23,"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. "
Matthew,13,24,"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: "
Matthew,13,25,"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. "
Matthew,13,26,"But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. "
Matthew,13,27,"So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? "
Matthew,13,28,"He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? "
Matthew,13,29,"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. "
Matthew,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. "
Matthew,13,31,"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: "
Matthew,13,32,"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. "
Matthew,13,33,"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. "
Matthew,13,34,All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: 
Matthew,13,35,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. "
Matthew,13,36,"Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. "
Matthew,13,37,"He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; "
Matthew,13,38,The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 
Matthew,13,39,The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 
Matthew,13,40,As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; "
Matthew,13,42,And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
Matthew,13,43,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. "
Matthew,13,44,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. "
Matthew,13,45,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: "
Matthew,13,46,"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. "
Matthew,13,47,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: "
Matthew,13,48,"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. "
Matthew,13,49,"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, "
Matthew,13,50,And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
Matthew,13,51,"Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. "
Matthew,13,52,"Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. "
Matthew,13,53,"And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. "
Matthew,13,54,"And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? "
Matthew,13,55,"Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? "
Matthew,13,56,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? "
Matthew,13,57,"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. "
Matthew,13,58,And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew,14,1,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, "
Matthew,14,2,"And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. "
Matthew,14,3,"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. "
Matthew,14,4,"For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. "
Matthew,14,5,"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. "
Matthew,14,6,"But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. "
Matthew,14,7,Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. 
Matthew,14,8,"And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. "
Matthew,14,9,"And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. "
Matthew,14,10,"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. "
Matthew,14,11,"And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. "
Matthew,14,12,"And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. "
Matthew,14,13,"When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. "
Matthew,14,14,"And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. "
Matthew,14,15,"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. "
Matthew,14,16,"But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. "
Matthew,14,17,"And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. "
Matthew,14,18,"He said, Bring them hither to me. "
Matthew,14,19,"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. "
Matthew,14,20,"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. "
Matthew,14,21,"And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. "
Matthew,14,22,"And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. "
Matthew,14,23,"And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. "
Matthew,14,24,"But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. "
Matthew,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. "
Matthew,14,26,"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. "
Matthew,14,27,"But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. "
Matthew,14,28,"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. "
Matthew,14,29,"And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. "
Matthew,14,30,"But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. "
Matthew,14,31,"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? "
Matthew,14,32,"And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. "
Matthew,14,33,"Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. "
Matthew,14,34,"And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. "
Matthew,14,35,"And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; "
Matthew,14,36,And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
Matthew,15,1,"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, "
Matthew,15,2,Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
Matthew,15,3,"But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? "
Matthew,15,4,"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. "
Matthew,15,5,"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; "
Matthew,15,6,"And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. "
Matthew,15,7,"Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, "
Matthew,15,8,"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. "
Matthew,15,9,"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. "
Matthew,15,10,"And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: "
Matthew,15,11,"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. "
Matthew,15,12,"Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? "
Matthew,15,13,"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. "
Matthew,15,14,"Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. "
Matthew,15,15,"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. "
Matthew,15,16,"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? "
Matthew,15,17,"Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? "
Matthew,15,18,But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 
Matthew,15,19,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: "
Matthew,15,20,These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. 
Matthew,15,21,"Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. "
Matthew,15,22,"And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. "
Matthew,15,23,"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. "
Matthew,15,24,"But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. "
Matthew,15,25,"Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. "
Matthew,15,26,"But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. "
Matthew,15,27,"And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. "
Matthew,15,28,"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. "
Matthew,15,29,"And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. "
Matthew,15,30,"And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: "
Matthew,15,31,"Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. "
Matthew,15,32,"Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. "
Matthew,15,33,"And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? "
Matthew,15,34,"And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. "
Matthew,15,35,And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
Matthew,15,36,"And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. "
Matthew,15,37,"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. "
Matthew,15,38,"And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. "
Matthew,15,39,"And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala."
Matthew,16,1,"The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. "
Matthew,16,2,"He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. "
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? "
Matthew,16,4,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. "
Matthew,16,5,"And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. "
Matthew,16,6,"Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. "
Matthew,16,7,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. "
Matthew,16,8,"Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? "
Matthew,16,9,"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? "
Matthew,16,10,"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? "
Matthew,16,11,"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? "
Matthew,16,12,"Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. "
Matthew,16,13,"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? "
Matthew,16,14,"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. "
Matthew,16,15,"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? "
Matthew,16,16,"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. "
Matthew,16,17,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,16,18,"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. "
Matthew,16,19,And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
Matthew,16,20,Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. 
Matthew,16,21,"From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. "
Matthew,16,22,"Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. "
Matthew,16,23,"But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. "
Matthew,16,24,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. "
Matthew,16,25,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 
Matthew,16,26,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? "
Matthew,16,27,For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. 
Matthew,16,28,"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
Matthew,17,1,"And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, "
Matthew,17,2,"And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. "
Matthew,17,3,"And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. "
Matthew,17,4,"Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. "
Matthew,17,5,"While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. "
Matthew,17,6,"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. "
Matthew,17,7,"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. "
Matthew,17,8,"And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. "
Matthew,17,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. "
Matthew,17,10,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? "
Matthew,17,11,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. "
Matthew,17,12,"But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. "
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. 
Matthew,17,14,"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, "
Matthew,17,15,"Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. "
Matthew,17,16,"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. "
Matthew,17,17,"Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. "
Matthew,17,18,And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. 
Matthew,17,19,"Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? "
Matthew,17,20,"And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. "
Matthew,17,21,Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. 
Matthew,17,22,"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: "
Matthew,17,23,"And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry. "
Matthew,17,24,"And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? "
Matthew,17,25,"He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? "
Matthew,17,26,"Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. "
Matthew,17,27,"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee."
Matthew,18,1,"At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? "
Matthew,18,2,"And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, "
Matthew,18,3,"And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,18,4,"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,18,5,And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. 
Matthew,18,6,"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. "
Matthew,18,7,Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! 
Matthew,18,8,"Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. "
Matthew,18,9,"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. "
Matthew,18,10,"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,18,11,For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. 
Matthew,18,12,"How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? "
Matthew,18,13,"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. "
Matthew,18,14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. "
Matthew,18,15,"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. "
Matthew,18,16,"But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. "
Matthew,18,17,"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. "
Matthew,18,18,"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. "
Matthew,18,19,"Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. "
Matthew,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. "
Matthew,18,21,"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? "
Matthew,18,22,"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. "
Matthew,18,23,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. "
Matthew,18,24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. "
Matthew,18,25,"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. "
Matthew,18,26,"The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. "
Matthew,18,27,"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. "
Matthew,18,28,"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. "
Matthew,18,29,"And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. "
Matthew,18,30,"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. "
Matthew,18,31,"So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. "
Matthew,18,32,"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: "
Matthew,18,33,"Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? "
Matthew,18,34,"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. "
Matthew,18,35,"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
Matthew,19,1,"And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; "
Matthew,19,2,And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. 
Matthew,19,3,"The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? "
Matthew,19,4,"And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, "
Matthew,19,5,"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? "
Matthew,19,6,"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. "
Matthew,19,7,"They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? "
Matthew,19,8,"He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. "
Matthew,19,9,"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. "
Matthew,19,10,"His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. "
Matthew,19,11,"But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. "
Matthew,19,12,"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. "
Matthew,19,13,"Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. "
Matthew,19,14,"But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,19,15,"And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. "
Matthew,19,16,"And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? "
Matthew,19,17,"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. "
Matthew,19,18,"He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, "
Matthew,19,19,"Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. "
Matthew,19,20,"The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? "
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. "
Matthew,19,22,"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. "
Matthew,19,23,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. "
Matthew,19,24,"And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. "
Matthew,19,25,"When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? "
Matthew,19,26,"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. "
Matthew,19,27,"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? "
Matthew,19,28,"And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. "
Matthew,19,29,"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. "
Matthew,19,30,But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
Matthew,20,1,"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. "
Matthew,20,2,"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. "
Matthew,20,3,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, "
Matthew,20,4,"And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. "
Matthew,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. "
Matthew,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? "
Matthew,20,7,"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. "
Matthew,20,8,"So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. "
Matthew,20,9,"And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. "
Matthew,20,10,"But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. "
Matthew,20,11,"And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, "
Matthew,20,12,"Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. "
Matthew,20,13,"But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? "
Matthew,20,14,"Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. "
Matthew,20,15,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? "
Matthew,20,16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. "
Matthew,20,17,"And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, "
Matthew,20,18,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, "
Matthew,20,19,"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. "
Matthew,20,20,"Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. "
Matthew,20,21,"And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. "
Matthew,20,22,"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. "
Matthew,20,23,"And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. "
Matthew,20,24,"And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. "
Matthew,20,25,"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. "
Matthew,20,26,"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; "
Matthew,20,27,"And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: "
Matthew,20,28,"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. "
Matthew,20,29,"And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. "
Matthew,20,30,"And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. "
Matthew,20,31,"And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. "
Matthew,20,32,"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? "
Matthew,20,33,"They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. "
Matthew,20,34,"So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him."
Matthew,21,1,"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, "
Matthew,21,2,"Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. "
Matthew,21,3,"And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. "
Matthew,21,4,"All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, "
Matthew,21,5,"Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. "
Matthew,21,6,"And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, "
Matthew,21,7,"And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. "
Matthew,21,8,"And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. "
Matthew,21,9,"And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. "
Matthew,21,10,"And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? "
Matthew,21,11,"And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. "
Matthew,21,12,"And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, "
Matthew,21,13,"And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. "
Matthew,21,14,And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. 
Matthew,21,15,"And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, "
Matthew,21,16,"And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? "
Matthew,21,17,"And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. "
Matthew,21,18,"Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. "
Matthew,21,19,"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. "
Matthew,21,20,"And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! "
Matthew,21,21,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. "
Matthew,21,22,"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. "
Matthew,21,23,"And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? "
Matthew,21,24,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. "
Matthew,21,25,"The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? "
Matthew,21,26,"But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. "
Matthew,21,27,"And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. "
Matthew,21,28,"But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. "
Matthew,21,29,"He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. "
Matthew,21,30,"And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. "
Matthew,21,31,"Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. "
Matthew,21,32,"For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. "
Matthew,21,33,"Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: "
Matthew,21,34,"And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. "
Matthew,21,35,"And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. "
Matthew,21,36,"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. "
Matthew,21,37,"But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. "
Matthew,21,38,"But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. "
Matthew,21,39,"And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. "
Matthew,21,40,"When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? "
Matthew,21,41,"They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. "
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? "
Matthew,21,43,"Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. "
Matthew,21,44,"And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. "
Matthew,21,45,"And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. "
Matthew,21,46,"But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, "
Matthew,22,2,"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, "
Matthew,22,3,And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. 
Matthew,22,4,"Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. "
Matthew,22,5,"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: "
Matthew,22,6,"And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. "
Matthew,22,7,"But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. "
Matthew,22,8,"Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. "
Matthew,22,9,"Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. "
Matthew,22,10,"So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. "
Matthew,22,11,"And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: "
Matthew,22,12,"And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. "
Matthew,22,13,"Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. "
Matthew,22,14,"For many are called, but few are chosen. "
Matthew,22,15,"Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. "
Matthew,22,16,"And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. "
Matthew,22,17,"Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? "
Matthew,22,18,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? "
Matthew,22,19,Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
Matthew,22,20,"And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? "
Matthew,22,21,"They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. "
Matthew,22,22,"When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way. "
Matthew,22,23,"The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, "
Matthew,22,24,"Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. "
Matthew,22,25,"Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: "
Matthew,22,26,"Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. "
Matthew,22,27,And last of all the woman died also. 
Matthew,22,28,Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. 
Matthew,22,29,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. "
Matthew,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. "
Matthew,22,31,"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, "
Matthew,22,32,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. "
Matthew,22,33,"And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. "
Matthew,22,34,"But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. "
Matthew,22,35,"Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, "
Matthew,22,36,"Master, which is the great commandment in the law? "
Matthew,22,37,"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. "
Matthew,22,38,This is the first and great commandment. 
Matthew,22,39,"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. "
Matthew,22,40,On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. 
Matthew,22,41,"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, "
Matthew,22,42,"Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. "
Matthew,22,43,"He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, "
Matthew,22,44,"The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? "
Matthew,22,45,"If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? "
Matthew,22,46,"And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions."
Matthew,23,1,"Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, "
Matthew,23,2,Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: 
Matthew,23,3,"All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. "
Matthew,23,4,"For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. "
Matthew,23,5,"But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, "
Matthew,23,6,"And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, "
Matthew,23,7,"And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. "
Matthew,23,8,"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. "
Matthew,23,9,"And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. "
Matthew,23,10,"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. "
Matthew,23,11,But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. 
Matthew,23,12,And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. 
Matthew,23,13,"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. "
Matthew,23,14,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. "
Matthew,23,15,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. "
Matthew,23,16,"Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! "
Matthew,23,17,"Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? "
Matthew,23,18,"And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. "
Matthew,23,19,"Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? "
Matthew,23,20,"Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. "
Matthew,23,21,"And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. "
Matthew,23,22,"And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. "
Matthew,23,23,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. "
Matthew,23,24,"Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. "
Matthew,23,25,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. "
Matthew,23,26,"Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. "
Matthew,23,27,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. "
Matthew,23,28,"Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. "
Matthew,23,29,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, "
Matthew,23,30,"And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. "
Matthew,23,31,"Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. "
Matthew,23,32,Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 
Matthew,23,33,"Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? "
Matthew,23,34,"Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: "
Matthew,23,35,"That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. "
Matthew,23,36,"Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. "
Matthew,23,37,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! "
Matthew,23,38,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. "
Matthew,23,39,"For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
Matthew,24,1,"And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. "
Matthew,24,2,"And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. "
Matthew,24,3,"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? "
Matthew,24,4,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. "
Matthew,24,5,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. "
Matthew,24,6,"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. "
Matthew,24,7,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. "
Matthew,24,8,All these are the beginning of sorrows. 
Matthew,24,9,"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. "
Matthew,24,10,"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. "
Matthew,24,11,"And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. "
Matthew,24,12,"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. "
Matthew,24,13,"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. "
Matthew,24,14,And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. 
Matthew,24,15,"When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) "
Matthew,24,16,Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: 
Matthew,24,17,Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: 
Matthew,24,18,Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. 
Matthew,24,19,"And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! "
Matthew,24,20,"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: "
Matthew,24,21,"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. "
Matthew,24,22,"And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. "
Matthew,24,23,"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. "
Matthew,24,24,"For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. "
Matthew,24,25,"Behold, I have told you before. "
Matthew,24,26,"Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. "
Matthew,24,27,"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. "
Matthew,24,28,"For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. "
Matthew,24,29,"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: "
Matthew,24,30,"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. "
Matthew,24,31,"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. "
Matthew,24,32,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: "
Matthew,24,33,"So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. "
Matthew,24,34,"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. "
Matthew,24,35,"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. "
Matthew,24,36,"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. "
Matthew,24,37,"But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. "
Matthew,24,38,"For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, "
Matthew,24,39,"And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. "
Matthew,24,40,"Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. "
Matthew,24,41,"Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. "
Matthew,24,42,Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
Matthew,24,43,"But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. "
Matthew,24,44,Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. 
Matthew,24,45,"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? "
Matthew,24,46,"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. "
Matthew,24,47,"Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. "
Matthew,24,48,"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; "
Matthew,24,49,"And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; "
Matthew,24,50,"The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, "
Matthew,24,51,"And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Matthew,25,1,"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. "
Matthew,25,2,"And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. "
Matthew,25,3,"They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: "
Matthew,25,4,But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
Matthew,25,5,"While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. "
Matthew,25,6,"And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. "
Matthew,25,7,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. "
Matthew,25,8,"And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. "
Matthew,25,9,"But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. "
Matthew,25,10,"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. "
Matthew,25,11,"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. "
Matthew,25,12,"But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. "
Matthew,25,13,"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. "
Matthew,25,14,"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. "
Matthew,25,15,"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. "
Matthew,25,16,"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. "
Matthew,25,17,"And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. "
Matthew,25,18,"But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. "
Matthew,25,19,"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. "
Matthew,25,20,"And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. "
Matthew,25,21,"His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. "
Matthew,25,22,"He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. "
Matthew,25,23,"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. "
Matthew,25,24,"Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: "
Matthew,25,25,"And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. "
Matthew,25,26,"His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: "
Matthew,25,27,"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. "
Matthew,25,28,"Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. "
Matthew,25,29,"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. "
Matthew,25,30,And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
Matthew,25,31,"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: "
Matthew,25,32,"And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: "
Matthew,25,33,"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. "
Matthew,25,34,"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: "
Matthew,25,35,"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: "
Matthew,25,36,"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. "
Matthew,25,37,"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? "
Matthew,25,38,"When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? "
Matthew,25,39,"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? "
Matthew,25,40,"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. "
Matthew,25,41,"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: "
Matthew,25,42,"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: "
Matthew,25,43,"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. "
Matthew,25,44,"Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? "
Matthew,25,45,"Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. "
Matthew,25,46,And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
Matthew,26,1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, "
Matthew,26,2,"Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. "
Matthew,26,3,"Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, "
Matthew,26,4,"And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. "
Matthew,26,5,"But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. "
Matthew,26,6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, "
Matthew,26,7,"There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. "
Matthew,26,8,"But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? "
Matthew,26,9,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. "
Matthew,26,10,"When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. "
Matthew,26,11,For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 
Matthew,26,12,"For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. "
Matthew,26,13,"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. "
Matthew,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, "
Matthew,26,15,"And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. "
Matthew,26,16,And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 
Matthew,26,17,"Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? "
Matthew,26,18,"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. "
Matthew,26,19,And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
Matthew,26,20,"Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. "
Matthew,26,21,"And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. "
Matthew,26,22,"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? "
Matthew,26,23,"And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. "
Matthew,26,24,The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. 
Matthew,26,25,"Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. "
Matthew,26,26,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. "
Matthew,26,27,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; "
Matthew,26,28,"For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. "
Matthew,26,29,"But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. "
Matthew,26,30,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. "
Matthew,26,31,"Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. "
Matthew,26,32,"But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. "
Matthew,26,33,"Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. "
Matthew,26,34,"Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. "
Matthew,26,35,"Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. "
Matthew,26,36,"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. "
Matthew,26,37,"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. "
Matthew,26,38,"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. "
Matthew,26,39,"And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. "
Matthew,26,40,"And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? "
Matthew,26,41,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. "
Matthew,26,42,"He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. "
Matthew,26,43,And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 
Matthew,26,44,"And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. "
Matthew,26,45,"Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. "
Matthew,26,46,"Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. "
Matthew,26,47,"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. "
Matthew,26,48,"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. "
Matthew,26,49,"And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. "
Matthew,26,50,"And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. "
Matthew,26,51,"And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. "
Matthew,26,52,"Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. "
Matthew,26,53,"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? "
Matthew,26,54,"But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? "
Matthew,26,55,"In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. "
Matthew,26,56,"But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. "
Matthew,26,57,"And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. "
Matthew,26,58,"But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. "
Matthew,26,59,"Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; "
Matthew,26,60,"But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, "
Matthew,26,61,"And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. "
Matthew,26,62,"And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? "
Matthew,26,63,"But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. "
Matthew,26,64,"Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. "
Matthew,26,65,"Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. "
Matthew,26,66,"What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. "
Matthew,26,67,"Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, "
Matthew,26,68,"Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? "
Matthew,26,69,"Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. "
Matthew,26,70,"But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. "
Matthew,26,71,"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. "
Matthew,26,72,"And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. "
Matthew,26,73,"And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. "
Matthew,26,74,"Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. "
Matthew,26,75,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly."
Matthew,27,1,"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: "
Matthew,27,2,"And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. "
Matthew,27,3,"Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, "
Matthew,27,4,"Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. "
Matthew,27,5,"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. "
Matthew,27,6,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. "
Matthew,27,7,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. "
Matthew,27,8,"Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. "
Matthew,27,9,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; "
Matthew,27,10,"And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me. "
Matthew,27,11,"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. "
Matthew,27,12,"And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. "
Matthew,27,13,"Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? "
Matthew,27,14,And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. 
Matthew,27,15,"Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. "
Matthew,27,16,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. "
Matthew,27,17,"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? "
Matthew,27,18,For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 
Matthew,27,19,"When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. "
Matthew,27,20,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. "
Matthew,27,21,"The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. "
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. "
Matthew,27,23,"And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. "
Matthew,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. "
Matthew,27,25,"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. "
Matthew,27,26,"Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. "
Matthew,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. "
Matthew,27,28,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. "
Matthew,27,29,"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! "
Matthew,27,30,"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. "
Matthew,27,31,"And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. "
Matthew,27,32,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. "
Matthew,27,33,"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, "
Matthew,27,34,"They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. "
Matthew,27,35,"And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. "
Matthew,27,36,And sitting down they watched him there; 
Matthew,27,37,"And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. "
Matthew,27,38,"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. "
Matthew,27,39,"And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, "
Matthew,27,40,"And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. "
Matthew,27,41,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, "
Matthew,27,42,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. "
Matthew,27,43,"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. "
Matthew,27,44,"The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. "
Matthew,27,45,Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. 
Matthew,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? "
Matthew,27,47,"Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. "
Matthew,27,48,"And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. "
Matthew,27,49,"The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. "
Matthew,27,50,"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. "
Matthew,27,51,"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; "
Matthew,27,52,"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, "
Matthew,27,53,"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. "
Matthew,27,54,"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. "
Matthew,27,55,"And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: "
Matthew,27,56,"Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children. "
Matthew,27,57,"When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: "
Matthew,27,58,"He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. "
Matthew,27,59,"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, "
Matthew,27,60,"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. "
Matthew,27,61,"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. "
Matthew,27,62,"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, "
Matthew,27,63,"Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. "
Matthew,27,64,"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. "
Matthew,27,65,"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. "
Matthew,27,66,"So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch."
Matthew,28,1,"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. "
Matthew,28,2,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. "
Matthew,28,3,"His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: "
Matthew,28,4,"And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. "
Matthew,28,5,"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. "
Matthew,28,6,"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. "
Matthew,28,7,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. "
Matthew,28,8,And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 
Matthew,28,9,"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. "
Matthew,28,10,"Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. "
Matthew,28,11,"Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. "
Matthew,28,12,"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, "
Matthew,28,13,"Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. "
Matthew,28,14,"And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. "
Matthew,28,15,"So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. "
Matthew,28,16,"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. "
Matthew,28,17,"And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. "
Matthew,28,18,"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. "
Matthew,28,19,"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: "
Matthew,28,20,"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen."
Mark,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"
Mark,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
Mark,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
Mark,1,4,"John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
Mark,1,5,"And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins."
Mark,1,6,"And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;"
Mark,1,7,"And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose."
Mark,1,8,I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
Mark,1,9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan."
Mark,1,10,"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:"
Mark,1,11,"And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Mark,1,12,And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
Mark,1,13,"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him."
Mark,1,14,"Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
Mark,1,15,"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."
Mark,1,16,"Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
Mark,1,17,"And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."
Mark,1,18,"And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him."
Mark,1,19,"And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets."
Mark,1,20,"And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him."
Mark,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
Mark,1,22,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
Mark,1,23,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
Mark,1,24,"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God."
Mark,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him."
Mark,1,26,"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
Mark,1,27,"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
Mark,1,28,And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
Mark,1,29,"And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
Mark,1,30,"But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her."
Mark,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
Mark,1,32,"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils."
Mark,1,33,And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark,1,34,"And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him."
Mark,1,35,"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
Mark,1,36,And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
Mark,1,37,"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee."
Mark,1,38,"And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth."
Mark,1,39,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils."
Mark,1,40,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
Mark,1,41,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean."
Mark,1,42,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
Mark,1,43,"And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;"
Mark,1,44,"And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
Mark,1,45,"But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
Mark,2,1,And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark,2,2,"And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them."
Mark,2,3,"And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four."
Mark,2,4,"And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay."
Mark,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."
Mark,2,6,"But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
Mark,2,7,Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
Mark,2,8,"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?"
Mark,2,9,"Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?"
Mark,2,10,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)"
Mark,2,11,"I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house."
Mark,2,12,"And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
Mark,2,13,"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them."
Mark,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him."
Mark,2,15,"And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
Mark,2,16,"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?"
Mark,2,17,"When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Mark,2,18,"And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?"
Mark,2,19,"And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
Mark,2,20,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
Mark,2,21,"No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse."
Mark,2,22,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles."
Mark,2,23,"And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn."
Mark,2,24,"And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?"
Mark,2,25,"And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?"
Mark,2,26,"How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?"
Mark,2,27,"And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:"
Mark,2,28,Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
Mark,3,1,And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
Mark,3,2,"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him."
Mark,3,3,"And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth."
Mark,3,4,"And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace."
Mark,3,5,"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
Mark,3,6,"And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
Mark,3,7,"But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,"
Mark,3,8,"And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him."
Mark,3,9,"And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
Mark,3,10,"For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues."
Mark,3,11,"And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God."
Mark,3,12,And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
Mark,3,13,"And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him."
Mark,3,14,"And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,"
Mark,3,15,"And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:"
Mark,3,16,And Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark,3,17,"And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:"
Mark,3,18,"And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,"
Mark,3,19,"And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house."
Mark,3,20,"And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
Mark,3,21,"And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."
Mark,3,22,"And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils."
Mark,3,23,"And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Mark,3,24,"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
Mark,3,25,"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
Mark,3,26,"And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end."
Mark,3,27,"No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house."
Mark,3,28,"Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:"
Mark,3,29,"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation."
Mark,3,30,"Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit."
Mark,3,31,"There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him."
Mark,3,32,"And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee."
Mark,3,33,"And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?"
Mark,3,34,"And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
Mark,3,35,"For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
Mark,4,1,"And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land."
Mark,4,2,"And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,"
Mark,4,3,"Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:"
Mark,4,4,"And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up."
Mark,4,5,"And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:"
Mark,4,6,"But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
Mark,4,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
Mark,4,8,"And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred."
Mark,4,9,"And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark,4,10,"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable."
Mark,4,11,"And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:"
Mark,4,12,"That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them."
Mark,4,13,"And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?"
Mark,4,14,The sower soweth the word.
Mark,4,15,"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts."
Mark,4,16,"And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"
Mark,4,17,"And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended."
Mark,4,18,"And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,"
Mark,4,19,"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful."
Mark,4,20,"And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred."
Mark,4,21,"And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?"
Mark,4,22,"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad."
Mark,4,23,"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark,4,24,"And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given."
Mark,4,25,"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath."
Mark,4,26,"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;"
Mark,4,27,"And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how."
Mark,4,28,"For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear."
Mark,4,29,"But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come."
Mark,4,30,"And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?"
Mark,4,31,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:"
Mark,4,32,"But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it."
Mark,4,33,"And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it."
Mark,4,34,"But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."
Mark,4,35,"And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side."
Mark,4,36,"And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships."
Mark,4,37,"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full."
Mark,4,38,"And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
Mark,4,39,"And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
Mark,4,40,"And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?"
Mark,4,41,"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
Mark,5,1,"And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes."
Mark,5,2,"And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
Mark,5,3,"Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:"
Mark,5,4,"Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him."
Mark,5,5,"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."
Mark,5,6,"But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"
Mark,5,7,"And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not."
Mark,5,8,"For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit."
Mark,5,9,"And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many."
Mark,5,10,And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark,5,11,Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark,5,12,"And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."
Mark,5,13,"And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."
Mark,5,14,"And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done."
Mark,5,15,"And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
Mark,5,16,"And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine."
Mark,5,17,And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
Mark,5,18,"And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him."
Mark,5,19,"Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."
Mark,5,20,"And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel."
Mark,5,21,"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea."
Mark,5,22,"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
Mark,5,23,"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."
Mark,5,24,"And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him."
Mark,5,25,"And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,"
Mark,5,26,"And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,"
Mark,5,27,"When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment."
Mark,5,28,"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole."
Mark,5,29,And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
Mark,5,30,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"
Mark,5,31,"And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
Mark,5,32,And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
Mark,5,34,"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague."
Mark,5,35,"While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?"
Mark,5,36,"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe."
Mark,5,37,"And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
Mark,5,38,"And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
Mark,5,39,"And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth."
Mark,5,40,"And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying."
Mark,5,41,"And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise."
Mark,5,42,"And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment."
Mark,5,43,And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
Mark,6,1,"And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him."
Mark,6,2,"And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"
Mark,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."
Mark,6,4,"But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house."
Mark,6,5,"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them."
Mark,6,6,"And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching."
Mark,6,7,"And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;"
Mark,6,8,"And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:"
Mark,6,9,But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
Mark,6,10,"And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place."
Mark,6,11,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."
Mark,6,12,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
Mark,6,13,"And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."
Mark,6,14,"And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."
Mark,6,15,"Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
Mark,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her."
Mark,6,18,"For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife."
Mark,6,19,"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
Mark,6,20,"For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
Mark,6,21,"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;"
Mark,6,22,"And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee."
Mark,6,23,"And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom."
Mark,6,24,"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
Mark,6,25,"And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist."
Mark,6,26,"And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her."
Mark,6,27,"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
Mark,6,28,"And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,"And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,"And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
Mark,6,31,"And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
Mark,6,32,And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
Mark,6,33,"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him."
Mark,6,34,"And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
Mark,6,35,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:"
Mark,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
Mark,6,37,"He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?"
Mark,6,38,"He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
Mark,6,39,And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark,6,40,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
Mark,6,41,"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
Mark,6,42,"And they did all eat, and were filled."
Mark,6,43,"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
Mark,6,44,And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
Mark,6,45,"And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."
Mark,6,46,"And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."
Mark,6,47,"And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
Mark,6,48,"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
Mark,6,49,"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:"
Mark,6,50,"For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
Mark,6,51,"And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
Mark,6,52,For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
Mark,6,53,"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,"
Mark,6,55,"And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
Mark,6,56,"And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
Mark,7,1,"Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem."
Mark,7,2,"And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault."
Mark,7,3,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."
Mark,7,4,"And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables."
Mark,7,5,"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?"
Mark,7,6,"He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
Mark,7,7,"Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
Mark,7,8,"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do."
Mark,7,9,"And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."
Mark,7,10,"For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:"
Mark,7,11,"But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free."
Mark,7,12,And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
Mark,7,13,"Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye."
Mark,7,14,"And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:"
Mark,7,15,"There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."
Mark,7,16,"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark,7,17,"And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable."
Mark,7,18,"And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;"
Mark,7,19,"Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?"
Mark,7,20,"And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
Mark,7,22,"Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:"
Mark,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
Mark,7,24,"And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid."
Mark,7,25,"For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:"
Mark,7,26,"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter."
Mark,7,27,"But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs."
Mark,7,28,"And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs."
Mark,7,29,"And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter."
Mark,7,30,"And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed."
Mark,7,31,"And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis."
Mark,7,32,"And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him."
Mark,7,33,"And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;"
Mark,7,34,"And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."
Mark,7,35,"And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain."
Mark,7,36,"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;"
Mark,7,37,"And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
Mark,8,1,"In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,"
Mark,8,2,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:"
Mark,8,3,"And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far."
Mark,8,4,"And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"
Mark,8,5,"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven."
Mark,8,6,"And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people."
Mark,8,7,"And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them."
Mark,8,8,"So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets."
Mark,8,9,And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark,8,10,"And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."
Mark,8,11,"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
Mark,8,12,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation."
Mark,8,13,"And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side."
Mark,8,14,"Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf."
Mark,8,15,"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod."
Mark,8,16,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread."
Mark,8,17,"And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?"
Mark,8,18,"Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?"
Mark,8,19,"When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve."
Mark,8,20,"And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven."
Mark,8,21,"And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?"
Mark,8,22,"And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him."
Mark,8,23,"And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought."
Mark,8,24,"And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking."
Mark,8,25,"After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly."
Mark,8,26,"And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town."
Mark,8,27,"And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?"
Mark,8,28,"And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets."
Mark,8,29,"And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ."
Mark,8,30,And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark,8,31,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
Mark,8,32,"And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
Mark,8,33,"But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
Mark,8,34,"And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
Mark,8,35,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it."
Mark,8,36,"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
Mark,8,37,Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark,8,38,"Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
Mark,9,1,"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power."
Mark,9,2,"And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them."
Mark,9,3,"And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them."
Mark,9,4,And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
Mark,9,6,For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
Mark,9,7,"And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
Mark,9,8,"And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves."
Mark,9,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead."
Mark,9,10,"And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean."
Mark,9,11,"And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?"
Mark,9,12,"And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."
Mark,9,13,"But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him."
Mark,9,14,"And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them."
Mark,9,15,"And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him."
Mark,9,16,"And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?"
Mark,9,17,"And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;"
Mark,9,18,"And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not."
Mark,9,19,"He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me."
Mark,9,20,"And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."
Mark,9,21,"And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child."
Mark,9,22,"And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us."
Mark,9,23,"Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth."
Mark,9,24,"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."
Mark,9,25,"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him."
Mark,9,26,"And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead."
Mark,9,27,"But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose."
Mark,9,28,"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?"
Mark,9,29,"And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting."
Mark,9,30,"And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it."
Mark,9,31,"For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day."
Mark,9,32,"But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him."
Mark,9,33,"And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?"
Mark,9,34,"But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest."
Mark,9,35,"And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all."
Mark,9,36,"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,"
Mark,9,37,"Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me."
Mark,9,38,"And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us."
Mark,9,39,"But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me."
Mark,9,40,For he that is not against us is on our part.
Mark,9,41,"For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward."
Mark,9,42,"And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."
Mark,9,43,"And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
Mark,9,44,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
Mark,9,45,"And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
Mark,9,46,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
Mark,9,47,"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:"
Mark,9,48,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
Mark,9,49,"For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."
Mark,9,50,"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another."
Mark,10,1,"And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again."
Mark,10,2,"And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him."
Mark,10,3,"And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?"
Mark,10,4,"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away."
Mark,10,5,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."
Mark,10,6,But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
Mark,10,7,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;"
Mark,10,8,"And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh."
Mark,10,9,"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
Mark,10,10,And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
Mark,10,11,"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her."
Mark,10,12,"And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."
Mark,10,13,"And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them."
Mark,10,14,"But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
Mark,10,15,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein."
Mark,10,16,"And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them."
Mark,10,17,"And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
Mark,10,18,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God."
Mark,10,19,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother."
Mark,10,20,"And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
Mark,10,21,"Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me."
Mark,10,22,"And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions."
Mark,10,23,"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
Mark,10,24,"And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
Mark,10,25,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
Mark,10,26,"And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?"
Mark,10,27,"And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."
Mark,10,28,"Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee."
Mark,10,29,"And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,"
Mark,10,30,"But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."
Mark,10,31,But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark,10,32,"And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,"
Mark,10,33,"Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:"
Mark,10,34,"And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again."
Mark,10,35,"And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire."
Mark,10,36,"And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?"
Mark,10,37,"They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory."
Mark,10,38,"But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
Mark,10,39,"And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:"
Mark,10,40,But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
Mark,10,41,"And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John."
Mark,10,42,"But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them."
Mark,10,43,"But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:"
Mark,10,44,"And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all."
Mark,10,45,"For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
Mark,10,46,"And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging."
Mark,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me."
Mark,10,48,"And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me."
Mark,10,49,"And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee."
Mark,10,50,"And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus."
Mark,10,51,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight."
Mark,10,52,"And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."
Mark,11,1,"And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,"
Mark,11,2,"And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him."
Mark,11,3,"And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither."
Mark,11,4,"And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him."
Mark,11,5,"And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?"
Mark,11,6,And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
Mark,11,7,"And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him."
Mark,11,8,"And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way."
Mark,11,9,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:"
Mark,11,10,"Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest."
Mark,11,11,"And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve."
Mark,11,12,"And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:"
Mark,11,13,"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet."
Mark,11,14,"And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it."
Mark,11,15,"And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;"
Mark,11,16,And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
Mark,11,17,"And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves."
Mark,11,18,"And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine."
Mark,11,19,"And when even was come, he went out of the city."
Mark,11,20,"And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots."
Mark,11,21,"And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away."
Mark,11,22,"And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God."
Mark,11,23,"For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith."
Mark,11,24,"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."
Mark,11,25,"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
Mark,11,26,"But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
Mark,11,27,"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,"
Mark,11,28,"And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?"
Mark,11,29,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark,11,30,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me."
Mark,11,31,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?"
Mark,11,32,"But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed."
Mark,11,33,"And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark,12,1,"And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country."
Mark,12,2,"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard."
Mark,12,3,"And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty."
Mark,12,4,"And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled."
Mark,12,5,"And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some."
Mark,12,6,"Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son."
Mark,12,7,"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.'"
Mark,12,8,"And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard."
Mark,12,9,"What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others."
Mark,12,10,And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
Mark,12,11,"This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
Mark,12,12,"And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way."
Mark,12,13,"And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words."
Mark,12,14,"And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
Mark,12,15,"Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it."
Mark,12,16,"And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's."
Mark,12,17,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him."
Mark,12,18,"Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,"
Mark,12,19,"Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
Mark,12,20,"Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed."
Mark,12,21,"And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise."
Mark,12,22,"And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also."
Mark,12,23,"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife."
Mark,12,24,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?"
Mark,12,25,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven."
Mark,12,26,"And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?"
Mark,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err."
Mark,12,28,"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?"
Mark,12,29,"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:"
Mark,12,30,"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment."
Mark,12,31,"And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."
Mark,12,32,"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:"
Mark,12,33,"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Mark,12,34,"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question."
Mark,12,35,"And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
Mark,12,37,David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark,12,38,"And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,"
Mark,12,39,"And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:"
Mark,12,40,"Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation."
Mark,12,41,"And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much."
Mark,12,42,"And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing."
Mark,12,43,"And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:"
Mark,12,44,"For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living."
Mark,13,1,"And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!"
Mark,13,2,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
Mark,13,3,"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,"
Mark,13,4,"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?"
Mark,13,5,"And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:"
Mark,13,6,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."
Mark,13,7,"And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet."
Mark,13,8,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows."
Mark,13,9,"But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them."
Mark,13,10,And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
Mark,13,11,"But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."
Mark,13,12,"Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death."
Mark,13,13,"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
Mark,13,14,"But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:"
Mark,13,15,"And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:"
Mark,13,16,And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
Mark,13,17,"But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"
Mark,13,18,And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
Mark,13,19,"For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be."
Mark,13,20,"And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days."
Mark,13,21,"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:"
Mark,13,22,"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect."
Mark,13,23,"But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."
Mark,13,24,"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"
Mark,13,25,"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken."
Mark,13,26,And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,"And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven."
Mark,13,28,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:"
Mark,13,29,"So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors."
Mark,13,30,"Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."
Mark,13,31,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark,13,32,"But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
Mark,13,33,"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is."
Mark,13,34,"For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."
Mark,13,35,"Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"
Mark,13,36,Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
Mark,13,37,"And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch."
Mark,14,1,"After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death."
Mark,14,2,"But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people."
Mark,14,3,"And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head."
Mark,14,4,"And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?"
Mark,14,5,"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her."
Mark,14,6,"And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me."
Mark,14,7,"For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always."
Mark,14,8,She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
Mark,14,9,"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."
Mark,14,10,"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them."
Mark,14,11,"And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him."
Mark,14,12,"And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?"
Mark,14,13,"And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him."
Mark,14,14,"And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?"
Mark,14,15,And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
Mark,14,16,"And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."
Mark,14,17,And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark,14,18,"And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me."
Mark,14,19,"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?"
Mark,14,20,"And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish."
Mark,14,21,"The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born."
Mark,14,22,"And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body."
Mark,14,23,"And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it."
Mark,14,24,"And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many."
Mark,14,25,"Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
Mark,14,26,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."
Mark,14,27,"And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered."
Mark,14,28,"But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee."
Mark,14,29,"But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I."
Mark,14,30,"And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."
Mark,14,31,"But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all."
Mark,14,32,"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray."
Mark,14,33,"And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;"
Mark,14,34,"And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch."
Mark,14,35,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
Mark,14,36,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."
Mark,14,37,"And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?"
Mark,14,38,"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak."
Mark,14,39,"And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words."
Mark,14,40,"And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him."
Mark,14,41,"And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Mark,14,42,"Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand."
Mark,14,43,"And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
Mark,14,44,"And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely."
Mark,14,45,"And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him."
Mark,14,46,"And they laid their hands on him, and took him."
Mark,14,47,"And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
Mark,14,48,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?"
Mark,14,49,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled."
Mark,14,50,"And they all forsook him, and fled."
Mark,14,51,"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:"
Mark,14,52,"And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."
Mark,14,53,And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark,14,54,"And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire."
Mark,14,55,And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
Mark,14,56,"For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together."
Mark,14,57,"And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,"
Mark,14,58,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."
Mark,14,59,But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"
Mark,14,61,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
Mark,14,62,"And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
Mark,14,63,"Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?"
Mark,14,64,Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
Mark,14,65,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands."
Mark,14,66,"And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:"
Mark,14,67,"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."
Mark,14,68,"But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew."
Mark,14,69,"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them."
Mark,14,70,"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto."
Mark,14,71,"But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak."
Mark,14,72,"And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept."
Mark,15,1,"And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it."
Mark,15,3,And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
Mark,15,4,"And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee."
Mark,15,5,But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
Mark,15,6,"Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired."
Mark,15,7,"And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection."
Mark,15,8,And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
Mark,15,9,"But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
Mark,15,10,For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
Mark,15,11,"But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them."
Mark,15,12,"And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?"
Mark,15,13,"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
Mark,15,14,"Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."
Mark,15,15,"And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified."
Mark,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."
Mark,15,17,"And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,"
Mark,15,18,"And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
Mark,15,19,"And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him."
Mark,15,20,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."
Mark,15,21,"And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross."
Mark,15,22,"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
Mark,15,23,And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
Mark,15,24,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."
Mark,15,25,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
Mark,15,26,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Mark,15,27,"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."
Mark,15,28,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."
Mark,15,29,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,"
Mark,15,30,"Save thyself, and come down from the cross."
Mark,15,31,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save."
Mark,15,32,"Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."
Mark,15,33,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
Mark,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
Mark,15,35,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias."
Mark,15,36,"And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down."
Mark,15,37,"And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
Mark,15,38,And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
Mark,15,39,"And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."
Mark,15,40,"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;"
Mark,15,41,"(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem."
Mark,15,42,"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,"
Mark,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus."
Mark,15,44,"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
Mark,15,45,"And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph."
Mark,15,46,"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre."
Mark,15,47,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
Mark,16,1,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him."
Mark,16,2,"And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."
Mark,16,3,"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?"
Mark,16,4,"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."
Mark,16,5,"And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted."
Mark,16,6,"And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."
Mark,16,7,"But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you."
Mark,16,8,"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid."
Mark,16,9,"Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils."
Mark,16,10,"And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
Mark,16,11,"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not."
Mark,16,12,"After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."
Mark,16,13,And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.
Mark,16,14,"Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen."
Mark,16,15,"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."
Mark,16,16,He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Mark,16,17,And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
Mark,16,18,"They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
Mark,16,19,"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God."
Mark,16,20,"And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen."
Luke,1,1,"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,"
Luke,1,2,"Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
Luke,1,3,"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,"
Luke,1,4,"That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed."
Luke,1,5,"THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth."
Luke,1,6,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
Luke,1,7,"And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years."
Luke,1,8,"And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,"
Luke,1,9,"According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord."
Luke,1,10,And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
Luke,1,11,And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
Luke,1,12,"And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him."
Luke,1,13,"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John."
Luke,1,14,And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke,1,15,"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb."
Luke,1,16,And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
Luke,1,17,"And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
Luke,1,18,"And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years."
Luke,1,19,"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings."
Luke,1,20,"And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."
Luke,1,21,"And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple."
Luke,1,22,"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."
Luke,1,23,"And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
Luke,1,24,"And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
Luke,1,25,"Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."
Luke,1,26,"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"
Luke,1,27,"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary."
Luke,1,28,"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."
Luke,1,29,"And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be."
Luke,1,30,"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."
Luke,1,31,"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS."
Luke,1,32,"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:"
Luke,1,33,And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
Luke,1,34,"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
Luke,1,35,"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
Luke,1,36,"And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."
Luke,1,37,For with God nothing shall be impossible.
Luke,1,38,"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her."
Luke,1,39,"And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;"
Luke,1,40,"And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth."
Luke,1,41,"And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:"
Luke,1,42,"And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb."
Luke,1,43,"And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
Luke,1,44,"For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
Luke,1,45,And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
Luke,1,46,"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,"
Luke,1,47,And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
Luke,1,48,"For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."
Luke,1,49,For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.
Luke,1,50,And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
Luke,1,51,He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
Luke,1,52,"He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree."
Luke,1,53,He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
Luke,1,54,"He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;"
Luke,1,55,"As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever."
Luke,1,56,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
Luke,1,57,Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
Luke,1,58,And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
Luke,1,59,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father."
Luke,1,60,"And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John."
Luke,1,61,"And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name."
Luke,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called."
Luke,1,63,"And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all."
Luke,1,64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God."
Luke,1,65,And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
Luke,1,66,"And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him."
Luke,1,67,"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,"
Luke,1,68,"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,"
Luke,1,69,And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
Luke,1,70,"As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:"
Luke,1,71,"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
Luke,1,72,"To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;"
Luke,1,73,"The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,"
Luke,1,74,"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
Luke,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
Luke,1,76,"And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;"
Luke,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,"
Luke,1,78,"Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,"
Luke,1,79,"To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
Luke,1,80,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel."
Luke,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed."
Luke,2,2,(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
Luke,2,3,"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
Luke,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
Luke,2,5,"To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
Luke,2,6,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
Luke,2,7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
Luke,2,8,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
Luke,2,9,"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid."
Luke,2,10,"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
Luke,2,11,"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."
Luke,2,12,"And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
Luke,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,"
Luke,2,14,"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
Luke,2,15,"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us."
Luke,2,16,"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
Luke,2,17,"And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
Luke,2,18,And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
Luke,2,19,"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart."
Luke,2,20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
Luke,2,21,"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
Luke,2,22,"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;"
Luke,2,23,"(As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)"
Luke,2,24,"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
Luke,2,25,"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him."
Luke,2,26,"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ."
Luke,2,27,"And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,"
Luke,2,28,"Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
Luke,2,29,"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:"
Luke,2,30,"For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,"
Luke,2,31,Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
Luke,2,32,"A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel."
Luke,2,33,And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
Luke,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
Luke,2,35,"(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
Luke,2,36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;"
Luke,2,37,"And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day."
Luke,2,38,"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
Luke,2,39,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
Luke,2,40,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."
Luke,2,41,Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
Luke,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast."
Luke,2,43,"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it."
Luke,2,44,"But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance."
Luke,2,45,"And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him."
Luke,2,46,"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
