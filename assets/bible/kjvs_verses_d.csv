Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I communed{H1696}{(H8765)} with mine own heart{H3820}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Lo, I am come to great estate{H1431}{(H8689)}, and have gotten{H3254}{(H8689)} more wisdom{H2451} than all they that have been before{H6440} me in Jerusalem{H3389}: yea, my heart{H3820} had great{H7235}{(H8687)} experience{H7200}{(H8804)} of wisdom{H2451} and knowledge{H1847}."
Ecclesiastes,1,17,"And I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} my heart{H3820} to know{H3045}{(H8800)} wisdom{H2451}, and to know{H3045}{(H8800)} madness{H1947} and folly{H5531}: I perceived{H3045}{(H8804)} that this{H1571} also is vexation{H7475} of spirit{H7307}."
Ecclesiastes,1,18,For in much{H7230} wisdom{H2451} is much{H7230} grief{H3708}: and he that increaseth{H3254}{(H8686)} knowledge{H1847} increaseth{H3254}{(H8686)} sorrow{H4341}.
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said{H559}{(H8804)} in mine heart{H3820}, Go to now{H3212}{(H8798)}, I will prove{H5254}{(H8762)} thee with mirth{H8057}, therefore enjoy{H7200}{(H8798)} pleasure{H2896}: and, behold, this also is vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"I said{H559}{(H8804)} of laughter{H7814}, It is mad{H1984}{(H8781)}: and of mirth{H8057}, What{H2090} doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} it?"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I sought{H8446}{(H8804)} in mine heart{H3820} to give{H4900}{(H8800)} myself{H1320} unto wine{H3196}, yet acquainting{H5090}{(H8802)} mine heart{H3820} with wisdom{H2451}; and to lay hold{H270}{(H8800)} on folly{H5531}, till I might see{H7200}{(H8799)} what was that good{H2896} for the sons{H1121} of men{H120}, which they should do{H6213}{(H8799)} under the heaven{H8064} all{H4557} the days{H3117} of their life{H2416}."
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I made me great{H1431}{(H8689)} works{H4639}; I builded{H1129}{(H8804)} me houses{H1004}; I planted{H5193}{(H8804)} me vineyards{H3754}:
Ecclesiastes,2,5,"I made{H6213}{(H8804)} me gardens{H1593} and orchards{H6508}, and I planted{H5193}{(H8804)} trees{H6086} in them of all kind of fruits{H6529}:"
Ecclesiastes,2,6,"I made{H6213}{(H8804)} me pools{H1295} of water{H4325}, to water{H8248}{(H8687)} therewith the wood{H3293} that bringeth forth{H6779}{(H8802)} trees{H6086}:"
Ecclesiastes,2,7,"I got{H7069}{(H8804)} me servants{H5650} and maidens{H8198}, and had servants born{H1121} in my house{H1004}; also I had great{H7235}{(H8687)} possessions{H4735} of great{H1241} and small cattle{H6629} above all that were in Jerusalem{H3389} before{H6440} me:"
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I gathered{H3664}{(H8804)} me also silver{H3701} and gold{H2091}, and the peculiar treasure{H5459} of kings{H4428} and of the provinces{H4082}: I gat{H6213}{(H8804)} me men singers{H7891}{(H8802)} and women singers{H7891}{(H8802)}, and the delights{H8588} of the sons{H1121} of men{H120}, as musical instruments{H7705}{H7705}, and that of all sorts."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,"So I was great{H1431}{(H8804)}, and increased{H3254}{(H8689)} more than all that were before{H6440} me in Jerusalem{H3389}: also my wisdom{H2451} remained{H5975}{(H8804)} with me."
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"And whatsoever mine eyes{H5869} desired{H7592}{(H8804)} I kept{H680}{(H8804)} not from them, I withheld{H4513}{(H8804)} not my heart{H3820} from any joy{H8057}; for my heart{H3820} rejoiced{H8056} in all my labour{H5999}: and this was my portion{H2506} of all my labour{H5999}."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Then I looked{H6437}{(H8804)} on all the works{H4639} that my hands{H3027} had wrought{H6213}{(H8804)}, and on the labour{H5999} that I had laboured{H5998}{(H8804)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)}: and, behold, all was vanity{H1892} and vexation{H7469} of spirit{H7307}, and there was no profit{H3504} under the sun{H8121}."
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"And I turned{H6437}{(H8804)} myself to behold{H7200}{(H8800)} wisdom{H2451}, and madness{H1947}, and folly{H5531}: for what can the man{H120} do that cometh{H935}{(H8799)} after{H310} the king{H4428}? even that which hath been already{H3528} done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"Then I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} that{H3426} wisdom{H2451} excelleth{H3504} folly{H5531}, as far as light{H216} excelleth{H3504} darkness{H2822}."
Ecclesiastes,2,14,The wise man's{H2450} eyes{H5869} are in his head{H7218}; but the fool{H3684} walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} in darkness{H2822}: and I myself perceived{H3045}{(H8804)} also that one{H259} event{H4745} happeneth{H7136}{(H8799)} to them all.
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then{H227} said{H559}{(H8804)} I in my heart{H3820}, As it happeneth{H4745} to the fool{H3684}, so it happeneth{H7136}{(H8799)} even to me{H1571}; and why was I then more{H3148} wise{H2449}{(H8804)}? Then I said{H1696}{(H8765)} in my heart{H3820}, that this also is vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,2,16,For there is no remembrance{H2146} of the wise{H2450} more than{H5973} of the fool{H3684} for ever{H5769}; seeing that which now{H3528} is in the days{H3117} to come{H935}{(H8802)} shall all be forgotten{H7911}{(H8738)}. And how dieth{H4191}{(H8799)} the wise{H2450} man? as the fool{H3684}.
Ecclesiastes,2,17,Therefore I hated{H8130}{(H8804)} life{H2416}; because the work{H4639} that is wrought{H6213}{(H8738)} under the sun{H8121} is grievous{H7451} unto me: for all is vanity{H1892} and vexation{H7469} of spirit{H7307}.
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"Yea, I hated{H8130}{(H8804)} all my labour{H5999} which I had taken{H6001} under the sun{H8121}: because I should leave{H3240}{(H8686)} it unto the man{H120} that shall be after{H310} me."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,"And who knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} whether he shall be a wise{H2450} man or a fool{H5530}? yet shall he have rule{H7980}{(H8799)} over all my labour{H5999} wherein I have laboured{H5998}{(H8804)}, and wherein I have shewed myself wise{H2449}{(H8804)} under the sun{H8121}. This is also vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,2,20,Therefore I went about{H5437}{(H8804)} to cause{H2976} my heart{H3820} to despair{H2976}{(H8763)} of all the labour{H5999} which I took{H5998}{(H8804)} under the sun{H8121}.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For there is{H3426} a man{H120} whose labour{H5999} is in wisdom{H2451}, and in knowledge{H1847}, and in equity{H3788}; yet to a man{H120} that hath not laboured{H5998}{(H8804)} therein shall he leave{H5414}{(H8799)} it for his portion{H2506}. This also is vanity{H1892} and a great{H7227} evil{H7451}."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,"For what hath{H1933}{(H8802)} man{H120} of all his labour{H5999}, and of the vexation{H7475} of his heart{H3820}, wherein{H1931} he hath laboured{H6001} under the sun{H8121}?"
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days{H3117} are sorrows{H4341}, and his travail{H6045} grief{H3708}; yea, his heart{H3820} taketh not rest{H7901}{(H8804)} in the night{H3915}. This is also vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"There is nothing better{H2896} for a man{H120}, than that he should eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8804)}, and that he should make his soul{H5315} enjoy{H7200}{(H8689)} good{H2896} in his labour{H5999}. This{H2090} also I saw{H7200}{(H8804)}, that it was from the hand{H3027} of God{H430}."
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"For who can eat{H398}{(H8799)}, or who else can hasten{H2363}{(H8799)} hereunto, more{H2351} than I?"
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For God giveth{H5414}{(H8804)} to a man{H120} that is good{H2896} in his sight{H6440} wisdom{H2451}, and knowledge{H1847}, and joy{H8057}: but to the sinner{H2398}{(H8802)} he giveth{H5414}{(H8804)} travail{H6045}, to gather{H622}{(H8800)} and to heap up{H3664}{(H8800)}, that he may give{H5414}{(H8800)} to him that is good{H2896} before{H6440} God{H430}. This also is vanity{H1892} and vexation{H7469} of spirit{H7307}."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"To every thing there is a season{H2165}, and a time{H6256} to every purpose{H2656} under the heaven{H8064}:"
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"A time{H6256} to be born{H3205}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to die{H4191}{(H8800)}; a time{H6256} to plant{H5193}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to pluck up{H6131}{(H8800)} that which is planted{H5193}{(H8803)};"
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"A time{H6256} to kill{H2026}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to heal{H7495}{(H8800)}; a time{H6256} to break down{H6555}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to build up{H1129}{(H8800)};"
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"A time{H6256} to weep{H1058}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to laugh{H7832}{(H8800)}; a time{H6256} to mourn{H5594}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to dance{H7540}{(H8800)};"
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"A time{H6256} to cast away{H7993}{(H8687)} stones{H68}, and a time{H6256} to gather{H3664} stones{H68} together{H3664}{(H8800)}; a time{H6256} to embrace{H2263}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to refrain{H7368}{(H8800)} from embracing{H2263}{(H8763)};"
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"A time{H6256} to get{H1245}{(H8763)}, and a time{H6256} to lose{H6}{(H8763)}; a time{H6256} to keep{H8104}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to cast away{H7993}{(H8687)};"
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"A time{H6256} to rend{H7167}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to sew{H8609}{(H8800)}; a time{H6256} to keep silence{H2814}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)};"
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"A time{H6256} to love{H157}{(H8800)}, and a time{H6256} to hate{H8130}{(H8800)}; a time{H6256} of war{H4421}, and a time{H6256} of peace{H7965}."
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit{H3504} hath he that worketh{H6213}{(H8802)} in that wherein{H834} he laboureth{H6001}?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,"I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the travail{H6045}, which God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} to the sons{H1121} of men{H120} to be exercised{H6031}{(H8800)} in it."
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He hath made{H6213}{(H8804)} every thing beautiful{H3303} in his time{H6256}: also he hath set{H5414}{(H8804)} the world{H5769} in their heart{H3820}, so that{H1097} no man{H120} can find out{H4672}{(H8799)} the work{H4639} that God{H430} maketh{H6213}{(H8804)} from the beginning{H7218} to the end{H5490}."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that there is no good{H2896} in them, but for a man to rejoice{H8055}{(H8800)}, and to do{H6213}{(H8800)} good{H2896} in his life{H2416}."
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"And also that every man{H120} should eat{H398}{(H8799)} and drink{H8354}{(H8804)}, and enjoy{H7200}{(H8804)} the good{H2896} of all his labour{H5999}, it is the gift{H4991} of God{H430}."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that, whatsoever God{H430} doeth{H6213}{(H8799)}, it shall be for ever{H5769}: nothing{H369} can be put{H3254}{(H8687)} to it, nor any thing taken{H1639}{(H8800)} from it: and God{H430} doeth{H6213}{(H8804)} it, that men should fear{H3372}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,That which hath been is now{H3528}; and that which is to be hath already{H3528} been; and God{H430} requireth{H1245}{(H8762)} that which is past{H7291}{(H8737)}.
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"And moreover I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} under the sun{H8121} the place{H4725} of judgment{H4941}, that wickedness{H7562} was there; and the place{H4725} of righteousness{H6664}, that iniquity{H7562} was there."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said{H559}{(H8804)} in mine heart{H3820}, God{H430} shall judge{H8199}{(H8799)} the righteous{H6662} and the wicked{H7563}: for there is a time{H6256} there for every purpose{H2656} and for every work{H4639}."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said{H559}{(H8804)} in mine heart{H3820} concerning the estate{H1700} of the sons{H1121} of men{H120}, that God{H430} might manifest{H1305}{(H8800)} them, and that they might see{H7200}{(H8800)} that they{H1992} themselves are beasts{H929}."
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For that which befalleth{H4745} the sons{H1121} of men{H120} befalleth{H4745} beasts{H929}; even one thing{H259} befalleth{H4745} them: as the one dieth{H4194}, so dieth{H4194} the other{H2088}; yea, they have all one{H259} breath{H7307}; so that a man{H120} hath no preeminence{H4195} above a beast{H929}: for all is vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go{H1980}{(H8802)} unto one{H259} place{H4725}; all are of the dust{H6083}, and all turn{H7725} to dust{H6083} again{H7725}{(H8804)}."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} the spirit{H7307} of man{H1121}{H120} that goeth{H5927}{(H8802)} upward{H4605}, and the spirit{H7307} of the beast{H929} that goeth{H3381}{(H8802)} downward{H4295} to the earth{H776}?"
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"Wherefore I perceive{H7200}{(H8804)} that there is nothing better{H2896}, than that a man{H120} should rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} in his own works{H4639}; for that is his portion{H2506}: for who shall bring{H935}{(H8686)} him to see{H7200}{(H8800)} what shall be after{H310} him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"So I returned{H7725}{(H8804)}, and considered{H7200}{(H8799)} all the oppressions{H6217} that are done{H6213}{(H8737)} under the sun{H8121}: and behold the tears{H1832} of such as were oppressed{H6231}{(H8803)}, and they had no comforter{H5162}{(H8764)}; and on the side{H3027} of their oppressors{H6231}{(H8802)} there was power{H3581}; but they had no comforter{H5162}{(H8764)}."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,Wherefore I praised{H7623}{(H8764)} the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} which are already{H3528} dead{H4191}{(H8804)} more than the living{H2416} which are yet{H5728} alive{H2416}.
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"Yea, better{H2896} is he than both{H8147} they, which hath not yet{H5728} been, who hath not seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the evil{H7451} work{H4639} that is done{H6213}{(H8738)} under the sun{H8121}."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,"Again, I considered{H7200}{(H8804)} all travail{H5999}, and every right{H3788} work{H4639}, that for this a man{H376} is envied{H7068} of his neighbour{H7453}. This is also vanity{H1892} and vexation{H7469} of spirit{H7307}."
Ecclesiastes,4,5,"The fool{H3684} foldeth{H2263} his hands{H3027} together{H2263}{(H8802)}, and eateth{H398}{(H8802)} his own flesh{H1320}."
Ecclesiastes,4,6,"Better{H2896} is an handful{H3709} with quietness{H5183}, than both the hands{H2651} full{H4393} with travail{H5999} and vexation{H7469} of spirit{H7307}."
Ecclesiastes,4,7,"Then I returned{H7725}{(H8804)}, and I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} vanity{H1892} under the sun{H8121}."
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is{H3426} one{H259} alone, and there is not a second{H8145}; yea, he hath neither child{H1121} nor brother{H251}: yet is there no end{H7093} of all his labour{H5999}; neither is his eye{H5869} satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)} with riches{H6239}; neither saith he, For whom do I labour{H6001}, and bereave{H2637}{(H8764)} my soul{H5315} of good{H2896}? This is also vanity{H1892}, yea, it is a sore{H7451} travail{H6045}."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two{H8147} are better{H2896} than one{H259}; because they have{H3426} a good{H2896} reward{H7939} for their labour{H5999}.
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fall{H5307}{(H8799)}, the one{H259} will lift up{H6965}{(H8686)} his fellow{H2270}: but woe{H337} to him that is alone{H259} when he falleth{H5307}{(H8799)}; for he hath not another{H8145} to help him up{H6965}{(H8687)}."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Again{H1571}, if two{H8147} lie together{H7901}{(H8799)}, then they have heat{H2552}{(H8804)}: but how can one{H259} be warm{H3179}{(H8799)} alone?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if one{H259} prevail{H8630}{(H8799)} against him, two{H8147} shall withstand{H5975}{(H8799)} him; and a threefold{H8027}{(H8794)} cord{H2339} is not quickly{H4120} broken{H5423}{(H8735)}."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,"Better{H2896} is a poor{H4542} and a wise{H2450} child{H3206} than an old{H2205} and foolish{H3684} king{H4428}, who will{H3045}{(H8804)} no more be admonished{H2094}{(H8736)}."
Ecclesiastes,4,14,For out of prison{H631}{(H8803)}{H1004} he cometh{H3318}{(H8804)} to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}; whereas also he that is born{H3205}{(H8738)} in his kingdom{H4438} becometh poor{H7326}{(H8802)}.
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I considered{H7200}{(H8804)} all the living{H2416} which walk{H1980}{(H8764)} under the sun{H8121}, with the second{H8145} child{H3206} that shall stand up{H5975}{(H8799)} in his stead."
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There is no end{H7093} of all the people{H5971}, even of all that have been before{H6440} them: they also that come after{H314} shall not rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} in him. Surely this also is vanity{H1892} and vexation{H7475} of spirit{H7307}."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Keep{H8104}{(H8798)} thy foot{H7272} when thou goest{H3212}{(H8799)} to the house{H1004} of God{H430}, and be more ready{H7138} to hear{H8085}{(H8800)}, than to give{H5414}{(H8800)} the sacrifice{H2077} of fools{H3684}: for they consider{H3045}{(H8802)} not that they do{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451}."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Be not rash{H926}{(H8762)} with thy mouth{H6310}, and let not thine heart{H3820} be hasty{H4116}{(H8762)} to utter{H3318}{(H8687)} any thing{H1697} before{H6440} God{H430}: for God{H430} is in heaven{H8064}, and thou upon earth{H776}: therefore let thy words{H1697} be few{H4592}."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,For a dream{H2472} cometh{H935}{(H8802)} through the multitude{H7230} of business{H6045}; and a fool's{H3684} voice{H6963} is known by multitude{H7230} of words{H1697}.
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When thou vowest{H5087}{(H8799)} a vow{H5088} unto God{H430}, defer{H309}{(H8762)} not to pay{H7999}{(H8763)} it; for he hath no pleasure{H2656} in fools{H3684}: pay{H7999}{(H8761)} that which thou hast vowed{H5087}{(H8799)}."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,"Better{H2896} is it that thou shouldest not vow{H5087}{(H8799)}, than that thou shouldest vow{H5087}{(H8799)} and not pay{H7999}{(H8762)}."
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Suffer{H5414}{(H8799)} not thy mouth{H6310} to cause thy flesh{H1320} to sin{H2398}{(H8687)}; neither say{H559}{(H8799)} thou before{H6440} the angel{H4397}, that it was an error{H7684}: wherefore should God{H430} be angry{H7107}{(H8799)} at thy voice{H6963}, and destroy{H2254}{(H8765)} the work{H4639} of thine hands{H3027}?"
Ecclesiastes,5,7,For in the multitude{H7230} of dreams{H2472} and many{H7235}{(H8687)} words{H1697} there are also divers vanities{H1892}: but fear{H3372}{(H8798)} thou God{H430}.
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If thou seest{H7200}{(H8799)} the oppression{H6233} of the poor{H7326}{(H8802)}, and violent{H1499} perverting of judgment{H4941} and justice{H6664} in a province{H4082}, marvel{H8539}{(H8799)} not at the matter{H2656}: for he that is higher{H1364} than the highest{H1364} regardeth{H8104}{(H8802)}; and there be higher{H1364} than they{H5921}."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,Moreover the profit{H3504} of the earth{H776} is for all: the king{H4428} himself is served{H5647}{(H8738)} by the field{H7704}.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,He that loveth{H157}{(H8802)} silver{H3701} shall not be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)} with silver{H3701}; nor he that loveth{H157}{(H8802)} abundance{H1995} with increase{H8393}: this is also vanity{H1892}.
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When goods{H2896} increase{H7235}{(H8800)}, they are increased{H7231}{(H8804)} that eat{H398}{(H8802)} them: and what good{H3788} is there to the owners{H1167} thereof, saving{H518} the beholding{H7207}{(H8675)}{H7212}{(H8801)} of them with their eyes{H5869}?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep{H8142} of a labouring man{H5647}{(H8802)} is sweet{H4966}, whether he eat{H398}{(H8799)} little{H4592} or much{H7235}{(H8687)}: but the abundance{H7647} of the rich{H6223} will not suffer{H3240}{(H8688)} him to sleep{H3462}{(H8800)}."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"There is{H3426} a sore{H2470}{(H8802)} evil{H7451} which I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} under the sun{H8121}, namely, riches{H6239} kept{H8104}{(H8803)} for the owners{H1167} thereof to their hurt{H7451}."
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"But those riches{H6239} perish{H6}{(H8804)} by evil{H7451} travail{H6045}: and he begetteth{H3205}{(H8689)} a son{H1121}, and there is nothing{H3972} in his hand{H3027}."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} of his mother's{H517} womb{H990}, naked{H6174} shall he return{H7725}{(H8799)} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} as he came{H935}{(H8804)}, and shall take{H5375}{(H8799)} nothing{H3972} of his labour{H5999}, which he may carry away{H3212}{(H8686)} in his hand{H3027}."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"And this{H2090} also is a sore{H2470}{(H8802)} evil{H7451}, that in all points{H5980} as he came{H935}{(H8804)}, so shall he go{H3212}{(H8799)}: and what profit{H3504} hath he that hath laboured{H5998}{(H8799)} for the wind{H7307}?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"All his days{H3117} also he eateth{H398}{(H8799)} in darkness{H2822}, and he hath much{H7235}{(H8687)} sorrow{H3707}{(H8804)} and wrath{H7110} with his sickness{H2483}."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Behold that which I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)}: it is good{H2896} and comely{H3303} for one to eat{H398}{(H8800)} and to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}, and to enjoy{H7200}{(H8800)} the good{H2896} of all his labour{H5999} that he taketh{H5998}{(H8799)} under the sun{H8121} all{H4557} the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}, which God{H430} giveth{H5414}{(H8804)} him: for it is his portion{H2506}."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Every man{H120} also to whom God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} riches{H6239} and wealth{H5233}, and hath given him power{H7980}{(H8689)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} thereof, and to take{H5375}{(H8800)} his portion{H2506}, and to rejoice{H8055}{(H8800)} in his labour{H5999}; this{H2090} is the gift{H4991} of God{H430}."
Ecclesiastes,5,20,For he shall not much{H7235}{(H8687)} remember{H2142}{(H8799)} the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}; because God{H430} answereth{H6031}{(H8688)} him in the joy{H8057} of his heart{H3820}.
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is{H3426} an evil{H7451} which I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} under the sun{H8121}, and it is common{H7227} among men{H120}:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"A man{H376} to whom God{H430} hath given{H5414}{(H8799)} riches{H6239}, wealth{H5233}, and honour{H3519}, so that he wanteth{H2638} nothing for his soul{H5315} of all that he desireth{H183}{(H8691)}, yet God{H430} giveth him not power{H7980}{(H8686)} to eat{H398}{(H8800)} thereof, but a stranger{H376}{H5237} eateth{H398}{(H8799)} it: this is vanity{H1892}, and it is an evil{H7451} disease{H2483}."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man{H376} beget{H3205}{(H8686)} an hundred{H3967} children, and live{H2421}{(H8799)} many{H7227} years{H8141}, so that the days{H3117} of his years{H8141} be many{H7227}, and his soul{H5315} be not filled{H7646}{(H8799)} with good{H2896}, and also that he have no burial{H6900}; I say{H559}{(H8804)}, that an untimely birth{H5309} is better{H2896} than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"For he cometh{H935}{(H8804)} in with vanity{H1892}, and departeth{H3212}{(H8799)} in darkness{H2822}, and his name{H8034} shall be covered{H3680}{(H8792)} with darkness{H2822}."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Moreover he hath not seen{H7200}{(H8804)} the sun{H8121}, nor known{H3045}{(H8804)} any thing: this{H2088} hath more rest{H5183} than{H2088} the other."
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"Yea, though{H432} he live{H2421}{(H8804)} a thousand{H505} years{H8141} twice{H6471} told, yet hath he seen{H7200}{(H8804)} no good{H2896}: do not all go{H1980}{(H8802)} to one{H259} place{H4725}?"
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"All the labour{H5999} of man{H120} is for his mouth{H6310}, and yet the appetite{H5315} is not filled{H4390}{(H8735)}."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,"For what hath the wise{H2450} more{H3148} than the fool{H3684}? what hath the poor{H6041}, that knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} to walk{H1980}{(H8800)} before the living{H2416}?"
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better{H2896} is the sight{H4758} of the eyes{H5869} than the wandering{H1980}{(H8800)} of the desire{H5315}: this is also vanity{H1892} and vexation{H7469} of spirit{H7307}.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"That which hath been is named{H7121}{(H8738)}{H8034} already{H3528}, and it is known{H3045}{(H8737)} that it is man{H120}: neither may{H3201}{(H8799)} he contend{H1777}{(H8800)} with him that is mightier{H8623} than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"Seeing there be{H3426} many{H7235}{(H8687)} things{H1697} that increase{H7235}{(H8688)} vanity{H1892}, what is man{H120} the better{H3148}?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} what is good{H2896} for man{H120} in this life{H2416}, all{H4557} the days{H3117} of his vain{H1892} life{H2416} which he spendeth{H6213}{(H8799)} as a shadow{H6738}? for who can tell{H5046}{(H8686)} a man{H120} what shall be after{H310} him under the sun{H8121}?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,A good name{H8034} is better{H2896} than precious{H2896} ointment{H8081}; and the day{H3117} of death{H4194} than the day{H3117} of one's birth{H3205}{(H8736)}.
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better{H2896} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to the house{H1004} of mourning{H60}, than to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to the house{H1004} of feasting{H4960}: for{H834} that is the end{H5490} of all men{H120}; and the living{H2416} will lay{H5414}{(H8799)} it to his heart{H3820}."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,Sorrow{H3708} is better{H2896} than laughter{H7814}: for by the sadness{H7455} of the countenance{H6440} the heart{H3820} is made better{H3190}{(H8799)}.
Ecclesiastes,7,4,The heart{H3820} of the wise{H2450} is in the house{H1004} of mourning{H60}; but the heart{H3820} of fools{H3684} is in the house{H1004} of mirth{H8057}.
Ecclesiastes,7,5,"It is better{H2896} to hear{H8085}{(H8800)} the rebuke{H1606} of the wise{H2450}, than for a man{H376} to hear{H8085}{(H8802)} the song{H7892} of fools{H3684}."
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling{H6963} of thorns{H5518} under a pot{H5518}, so is the laughter{H7814} of the fool{H3684}: this also is vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,Surely oppression{H6233} maketh a wise man{H2450} mad{H1984}{(H8779)}; and a gift{H4979} destroyeth{H6}{(H8762)} the heart{H3820}.
Ecclesiastes,7,8,Better{H2896} is the end{H319} of a thing{H1697} than the beginning{H7225} thereof: and the patient{H750} in spirit{H7307} is better{H2896} than the proud{H1362} in spirit{H7307}.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,Be not hasty{H926}{(H8762)} in thy spirit{H7307} to be angry{H3707}{(H8800)}: for anger{H3708} resteth{H5117}{(H8799)} in the bosom{H2436} of fools{H3684}.
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Say{H559}{(H8799)} not thou, What is the cause that the former{H7223} days{H3117} were better{H2896} than these? for thou dost not enquire{H7592}{(H8804)} wisely{H2451} concerning this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,Wisdom{H2451} is good{H2896} with an inheritance{H5159}: and by it there is profit{H3148} to them that see{H7200}{(H8802)} the sun{H8121}.
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For wisdom{H2451} is a defence{H6738}, and money{H3701} is a defence{H6738}: but the excellency{H3504} of knowledge{H1847} is, that wisdom{H2451} giveth life{H2421}{(H8762)} to them that have{H1167} it."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Consider{H7200}{(H8798)} the work{H4639} of God{H430}: for who can{H3201}{(H8799)} make that straight{H8626}{(H8763)}, which he hath made crooked{H5791}{(H8765)}?"
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day{H3117} of prosperity{H2896} be joyful{H2896}, but in the day{H3117} of adversity{H7451} consider{H7200}{(H8798)}: God{H430} also hath set{H6213}{(H8804)} the one over against{H5980} the other, to the end{H1700} that man{H120} should find{H4672}{(H8799)} nothing{H3972} after{H310} him."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"All things have I seen{H7200}{(H8804)} in the days{H3117} of my vanity{H1892}: there is{H3426} a just{H6662} man that perisheth{H6}{(H8802)} in his righteousness{H6664}, and there is a wicked{H7563} man that prolongeth{H748}{(H8688)} his life in his wickedness{H7451}."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,Be not righteous{H6662} over much{H7235}{(H8687)}; neither make thyself over{H3148} wise{H2449}{(H8691)}: why shouldest thou destroy{H8074}{(H8709)} thyself?
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Be not over much{H7235}{(H8687)} wicked{H7561}{(H8799)}, neither be thou foolish{H5530}: why shouldest thou die{H4191}{(H8799)} before thy time{H6256}?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18,"It is good{H2896} that thou shouldest take hold{H270}{(H8799)} of this; yea, also from this{H2088} withdraw{H3240}{(H8686)} not thine hand{H3027}: for he that feareth{H3373} God{H430} shall come forth{H3318}{(H8799)} of them all."
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom{H2451} strengtheneth{H5810}{(H8799)} the wise{H2450} more than ten{H6235} mighty{H7989} men which are in the city{H5892}.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"For there is not a just{H6662} man{H120} upon earth{H776}, that doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} good{H2896}, and sinneth{H2398}{(H8799)} not."
Ecclesiastes,7,21,Also take{H5414}{(H8799)} no heed{H3820} unto all words{H1697} that are spoken{H1696}{(H8762)}; lest thou hear{H8085}{(H8799)} thy servant{H5650} curse{H7043}{(H8764)} thee:
Ecclesiastes,7,22,For oftentimes{H6471}{H7227} also thine own heart{H3820} knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} that thou thyself likewise hast cursed{H7043}{(H8765)} others{H312}.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"All this{H2090} have I proved{H5254}{(H8765)} by wisdom{H2451}: I said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will be wise{H2449}{(H8799)}; but it was far{H7350} from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,"That which is far off{H7350}, and exceeding deep{H6013}, who can find it out{H4672}{(H8799)}?"
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I applied{H5437}{(H8804)} mine heart{H3820} to know{H3045}{(H8800)}, and to search{H8446}{(H8800)}, and to seek out{H1245}{(H8763)} wisdom{H2451}, and the reason{H2808} of things, and to know{H3045}{(H8800)} the wickedness{H7562} of folly{H3689}, even of foolishness{H5531} and madness{H1947}:"
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I find{H4672}{(H8802)} more bitter{H4751} than death{H4194} the woman{H802}, whose heart{H3820} is snares{H4685} and nets{H2764}, and her hands{H3027} as bands{H612}: whoso pleaseth{H2896}{H6440} God{H430} shall escape{H4422}{(H8735)} from her; but the sinner{H2398}{(H8802)} shall be taken{H3920}{(H8735)} by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"Behold{H7200}{(H8798)}, this have I found{H4672}{(H8804)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the preacher{H6953}, counting one{H259} by one{H259}, to find out{H4672}{(H8800)} the account{H2808}:"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"Which yet my soul{H5315} seeketh{H1245}{(H8765)}, but I find{H4672}{(H8804)} not: one{H259} man{H120} among a thousand{H505} have I found{H4672}{(H8804)}; but a woman{H802} among all those have I not found{H4672}{(H8804)}."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Lo{H7200}{(H8798)}, this only{H905} have I found{H4672}{(H8804)}, that God{H430} hath made{H6213}{(H8804)} man{H120} upright{H3477}; but they have sought out{H1245}{(H8765)} many{H7227} inventions{H2810}."
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who is as the wise{H2450} man? and who knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} the interpretation{H6592} of a thing{H1697}? a man's{H120} wisdom{H2451} maketh his face{H6440} to shine{H215}{(H8686)}, and the boldness{H5797} of his face{H6440} shall be changed{H8132}{(H8792)}."
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I counsel thee to keep{H8104}{(H8798)} the king's{H4428} commandment{H6310}, and that in regard{H1700} of the oath{H7621} of God{H430}."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,Be not hasty{H926}{(H8735)} to go out{H3212}{(H8799)} of his sight{H6440}: stand{H5975}{(H8799)} not in an evil{H7451} thing{H1697}; for he doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} whatsoever pleaseth{H2654}{(H8799)} him.
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"Where the word{H1697} of a king{H4428} is, there is power{H7983}: and who may say{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, What doest{H6213}{(H8799)} thou?"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,Whoso keepeth{H8104}{(H8802)} the commandment{H4687} shall feel{H3045}{(H8799)} no evil{H7451} thing{H1697}: and a wise man's{H2450} heart{H3820} discerneth{H3045}{(H8799)} both time{H6256} and judgment{H4941}.
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"Because to every purpose{H2656} there is{H3426} time{H6256} and judgment{H4941}, therefore the misery{H7451} of man{H120} is great{H7227} upon him."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,For he knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} not that which shall be: for who can tell{H5046}{(H8686)} him when it shall be?
Ecclesiastes,8,8,There is no man{H120} that hath power{H7989} over the spirit{H7307} to retain{H3607}{(H8800)} the spirit{H7307}; neither hath he power{H7983} in the day{H3117} of death{H4194}: and there is no discharge{H4917} in that war{H4421}; neither shall wickedness{H7562} deliver{H4422}{(H8762)} those that are given{H1167} to it.
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this have I seen{H7200}{(H8804)}, and applied{H5414}{(H8800)} my heart{H3820} unto every work{H4639} that is done{H6213}{(H8738)} under the sun{H8121}: there is a time{H6256} wherein one man{H120} ruleth{H7980}{(H8804)} over another to his own hurt{H7451}."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"And so{H3651} I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the wicked{H7563} buried{H6912}{(H8803)}, who had come{H935}{(H8804)} and gone{H1980}{(H8762)} from the place{H4725} of the holy{H6918}, and they were forgotten{H7911}{(H8691)} in the city{H5892} where they had so done{H6213}{(H8804)}: this is also vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because sentence{H6599} against an evil{H7451} work{H4639} is not executed{H6213}{(H8738)} speedily{H4120}, therefore the heart{H3820} of the sons{H1121} of men{H120} is fully set{H4390}{(H8804)} in them to do{H6213}{(H8800)} evil{H7451}."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Though a sinner{H2398}{(H8802)} do{H6213}{(H8802)} evil{H7451} an hundred times{H3967}, and his days be prolonged{H748}{(H8688)}, yet surely I know{H3045}{(H8802)} that it shall be well{H2896} with them that fear{H3373} God{H430}, which fear{H3372}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him:"
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it shall not be well{H2896} with the wicked{H7563}, neither shall he prolong{H748}{(H8686)} his days{H3117}, which are as a shadow{H6738}; because he feareth{H3373} not before{H6440} God{H430}."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is{H3426} a vanity{H1892} which is done{H6213}{(H8738)} upon the earth{H776}; that there be just{H6662} men, unto whom it happeneth{H5060}{(H8688)} according to the work{H4639} of the wicked{H7563}; again, there be{H3426} wicked{H7563} men, to whom it happeneth{H5060}{(H8688)} according to the work{H4639} of the righteous{H6662}: I said{H559}{(H8804)} that this also{H1571} is vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"Then I commended{H7623}{(H8765)} mirth{H8057}, because a man{H120} hath no better thing{H2896} under the sun{H8121}, than to eat{H398}{(H8800)}, and to drink{H8354}{(H8800)}, and to be merry{H8055}{(H8800)}: for that shall abide{H3867}{(H8799)} with him of his labour{H5999} the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}, which God{H430} giveth{H5414}{(H8804)} him under the sun{H8121}."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied{H5414}{(H8804)} mine heart{H3820} to know{H3045}{(H8800)} wisdom{H2451}, and to see{H7200}{(H8800)} the business{H6045} that is done{H6213}{(H8738)} upon the earth{H776}:(for also there is that neither day{H3117} nor night{H3915} seeth{H7200}{(H8802)} sleep{H8142} with his eyes{H5869}:)"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"Then I beheld{H7200}{(H8804)} all the work{H4639} of God{H430}, that a man{H120} cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} find out{H4672}{(H8800)} the work{H4639} that is done{H6213}{(H8738)} under the sun{H8121}: because{H834} though{H7945} a man{H120} labour{H5998}{(H8799)} to seek it out{H1245}{(H8763)}, yet he shall not find{H4672}{(H8799)} it; yea further; though a wise{H2450} man think{H559}{(H8799)} to know{H3045}{(H8800)} it, yet shall he not be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to find{H4672}{(H8800)} it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For all this I considered{H5414}{(H8804)} in my heart{H3820} even to declare{H952}{(H8800)} all this, that the righteous{H6662}, and the wise{H2450}, and their works{H5652}, are in the hand{H3027} of God{H430}: no man{H120} knoweth{H3045}{(H8802)} either{H1571} love{H160} or hatred{H8135} by all that is before{H6440} them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All things come alike to all: there is one{H259} event{H4745} to the righteous{H6662}, and to the wicked{H7563}; to the good{H2896} and to the clean{H2889}, and to the unclean{H2931}; to him that sacrificeth{H2076}{(H8802)}, and to him that{H834} sacrificeth{H2076}{(H8802)} not: as is the good{H2896}, so is the sinner{H2398}{(H8802)}; and he that sweareth{H7650}{(H8737)}, as he that feareth{H3373} an oath{H7621}."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is an evil{H7451} among all things that are done{H6213}{(H8738)} under the sun{H8121}, that there is one{H259} event{H4745} unto all: yea, also the heart{H3820} of the sons{H1121} of men{H120} is full{H4390}{(H8804)} of evil{H7451}, and madness{H1947} is in their heart{H3824} while they live{H2416}, and after{H310} that they go to the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,For{H4310} to him that is{H3426} joined{H2266}{(H8792)}{(H8675)}{H977}{(H8792)} to all the living{H2416} there is hope{H986}: for a living{H2416} dog{H3611} is better{H2896} than a dead{H4191}{(H8801)} lion{H738}.
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living{H2416} know{H3045}{(H8802)} that they shall die{H4191}{(H8799)}: but the dead{H4191}{(H8801)} know{H3045}{(H8802)} not any thing{H3972}, neither have they any more a reward{H7939}; for the memory{H2143} of them is forgotten{H7911}{(H8738)}."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Also their love{H160}, and their hatred{H8135}, and their envy{H7068}, is now{H3528} perished{H6}{(H8804)}; neither have they any more a portion{H2506} for ever{H5769} in any thing that is done{H6213}{(H8738)} under the sun{H8121}."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go thy way{H3212}{(H8798)}, eat{H398}{(H8798)} thy bread{H3899} with joy{H8057}, and drink{H8354}{(H8798)} thy wine{H3196} with a merry{H2896} heart{H3820}; for God{H430} now{H3528} accepteth{H7521}{(H8804)} thy works{H4639}."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,Let thy garments{H899} be always{H6256} white{H3836}; and let thy head{H7218} lack{H2637}{(H8799)} no ointment{H8081}.
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Live{H2416} joyfully{H7200}{(H8798)} with the wife{H802} whom thou lovest{H157}{(H8804)} all the days{H3117} of the life{H2416} of thy vanity{H1892}, which he hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} thee under the sun{H8121}, all the days{H3117} of thy vanity{H1892}: for that is thy portion{H2506} in this life{H2416}, and in thy labour{H5999} which thou takest{H6001} under the sun{H8121}."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatsoever thy hand{H3027} findeth{H4672}{(H8799)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)}, do{H6213}{(H8798)} it with thy might{H3581}; for there is no work{H4639}, nor device{H2808}, nor knowledge{H1847}, nor wisdom{H2451}, in the grave{H7585}, whither thou goest{H1980}{(H8802)}."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I returned{H7725}{(H8804)}, and saw{H7200}{(H8800)} under the sun{H8121}, that the race{H4793} is not to the swift{H7031}, nor the battle{H4421} to the strong{H1368}, neither yet bread{H3899} to the wise{H2450}, nor yet riches{H6239} to men of understanding{H995}{(H8737)}, nor yet favour{H2580} to men of skill{H3045}{(H8802)}; but time{H6256} and chance{H6294} happeneth{H7136}{(H8799)} to them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man{H120} also knoweth{H3045}{(H8799)} not his time{H6256}: as the fishes{H1709} that are taken{H270}{(H8737)} in an evil{H7451} net{H4685}, and as the birds{H6833} that are caught{H270}{(H8803)} in the snare{H6341}; so{H1992} are the sons{H1121} of men{H120} snared{H3369}{(H8795)} in an evil{H7451} time{H6256}, when it falleth{H5307}{(H8799)} suddenly{H6597} upon them."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"This{H2090} wisdom{H2451} have I seen{H7200}{(H8804)} also under the sun{H8121}, and it seemed great{H1419} unto me:"
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"There was a little{H6996} city{H5892}, and few{H4592} men{H582} within it; and there came{H935}{(H8804)} a great{H1419} king{H4428} against it, and besieged{H5437}{(H8804)} it, and built{H1129}{(H8804)} great{H1419} bulwarks{H4685} against it:"
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"Now there was found{H4672}{(H8804)} in it a poor{H4542} wise{H2450} man{H376}, and he by his wisdom{H2451} delivered{H4422}{(H8765)} the city{H5892}; yet no man{H120} remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} that same poor{H4542} man{H376}."
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"Then said{H559}{(H8804)} I, Wisdom{H2451} is better{H2896} than strength{H1369}: nevertheless the poor man's{H4542} wisdom{H2451} is despised{H959}{(H8803)}, and his words{H1697} are not heard{H8085}{(H8737)}."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The words{H1697} of wise{H2450} men are heard{H8085}{(H8737)} in quiet{H5183} more than the cry{H2201} of him that ruleth{H4910}{(H8802)} among fools{H3684}.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,Wisdom{H2451} is better{H2896} than weapons{H3627} of war{H7128}: but one{H259} sinner{H2398}{(H8802)} destroyeth{H6}{(H8762)} much{H7235}{(H8687)} good{H2896}.
Ecclesiastes,10,1,Dead{H4194} flies{H2070} cause the ointment{H8081} of the apothecary{H7543}{(H8802)} to send forth{H5042}{(H8686)} a stinking savour{H887}{(H8686)}: so doth a little{H4592} folly{H5531} him that is in reputation{H3368} for wisdom{H2451} and honour{H3519}.
Ecclesiastes,10,2,A wise man's{H2450} heart{H3820} is at his right hand{H3225}; but a fool's{H3684} heart{H3820} at his left{H8040}.
Ecclesiastes,10,3,"Yea also, when he that is a fool{H5530} walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} by the way{H1870}, his wisdom{H3820} faileth{H2638} him, and he saith{H559}{(H8804)} to every one that he is a fool{H5530}."
Ecclesiastes,10,4,"If the spirit{H7307} of the ruler{H4910}{(H8802)} rise up{H5927}{(H8799)} against thee, leave{H3240}{(H8686)} not thy place{H4725}; for yielding{H4832} pacifieth{H3240}{(H8686)} great{H1419} offences{H2399}."
Ecclesiastes,10,5,"There is{H3426} an evil{H7451} which I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} under the sun{H8121}, as an error{H7684} which proceedeth{H3318}{(H8802)} from{H6440} the ruler{H7989}:"
Ecclesiastes,10,6,"Folly{H5529} is set{H5414}{(H8738)} in great{H7227} dignity{H4791}, and the rich{H6223} sit{H3427}{(H8799)} in low place{H8216}."
Ecclesiastes,10,7,"I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} servants{H5650} upon horses{H5483}, and princes{H8269} walking{H1980}{(H8802)} as servants{H5650} upon the earth{H776}."
Ecclesiastes,10,8,"He that diggeth{H2658}{(H8802)} a pit{H1475} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} into it; and whoso breaketh{H6555}{(H8802)} an hedge{H1447}, a serpent{H5175} shall bite{H5391}{(H8799)} him."
Ecclesiastes,10,9,Whoso removeth{H5265}{(H8688)} stones{H68} shall be hurt{H6087}{(H8735)} therewith; and he that cleaveth{H1234}{(H8802)} wood{H6086} shall be endangered{H5533}{(H8735)} thereby.
Ecclesiastes,10,10,"If the iron{H1270} be blunt{H6949}{(H8765)}, and he do not whet{H7043}{(H8773)} the edge{H6440}, then must he put{H1396}{(H8762)} to more strength{H2428}: but wisdom{H2451} is profitable{H3504} to direct{H3787}{(H8687)}."
Ecclesiastes,10,11,Surely the serpent{H5175} will bite{H5391}{(H8799)} without enchantment{H3908}; and a babbler{H3956}{H1167} is no better{H3504}.
Ecclesiastes,10,12,The words{H1697} of a wise man's{H2450} mouth{H6310} are gracious{H2580}; but the lips{H8193} of a fool{H3684} will swallow up{H1104}{(H8762)} himself.
Ecclesiastes,10,13,The beginning{H8462} of the words{H1697} of his mouth{H6310} is foolishness{H5531}: and the end{H319} of his talk{H6310} is mischievous{H7451} madness{H1948}.
Ecclesiastes,10,14,"A fool{H5530} also is full{H7235}{(H8686)} of words{H1697}: a man{H120} cannot tell{H3045}{(H8799)} what shall be; and what shall be after{H310} him, who can tell{H5046}{(H8686)} him?"
Ecclesiastes,10,15,"The labour{H5999} of the foolish{H3684} wearieth{H3021}{(H8762)} every one of them, because he knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} not how to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to the city{H5892}."
Ecclesiastes,10,16,"Woe{H337} to thee, O land{H776}, when thy king{H4428} is a child{H5288}, and thy princes{H8269} eat{H398}{(H8799)} in the morning{H1242}!"
Ecclesiastes,10,17,"Blessed{H835} art thou, O land{H776}, when thy king{H4428} is the son{H1121} of nobles{H2715}, and thy princes{H8269} eat{H398}{(H8799)} in due season{H6256}, for strength{H1369}, and not for drunkenness{H8358}!"
Ecclesiastes,10,18,By much slothfulness{H6103} the building{H4746} decayeth{H4355}{(H8735)}; and through idleness{H8220} of the hands{H3027} the house{H1004} droppeth through{H1811}{(H8799)}.
Ecclesiastes,10,19,"A feast{H3899} is made{H6213}{(H8802)} for laughter{H7814}, and wine{H3196} maketh merry{H8055}{(H8762)}{H2416}: but money{H3701} answereth{H6030}{(H8799)} all things."
Ecclesiastes,10,20,"Curse{H7043}{(H8762)} not the king{H4428}, no not in thy thought{H4093}; and curse{H7043}{(H8762)} not the rich{H6223} in thy bedchamber{H2315}{H4904}: for a bird{H5775} of the air{H8064} shall carry{H3212}{(H8686)} the voice{H6963}, and that which hath{H1167} wings{H3671} shall tell{H5046}{(H8686)} the matter{H1697}."
Ecclesiastes,11,1,Cast{H7971}{(H8761)} thy bread{H3899} upon{H6440} the waters{H4325}: for thou shalt find{H4672}{(H8799)} it after many{H7230} days{H3117}.
Ecclesiastes,11,2,"Give{H5414}{(H8798)} a portion{H2506} to seven{H7651}, and also to eight{H8083}; for thou knowest{H3045}{(H8799)} not what evil{H7451} shall be upon the earth{H776}."
Ecclesiastes,11,3,"If the clouds{H5645} be full{H4390}{(H8735)} of rain{H1653}, they empty{H7324}{(H8686)} themselves upon the earth{H776}: and if the tree{H6086} fall{H5307}{(H8799)} toward the south{H1864}, or toward the north{H6828}, in the place{H4725} where the tree{H6086} falleth{H5307}{(H8799)}, there it shall be{H1933}{(H8799)}."
Ecclesiastes,11,4,He that observeth{H8104}{(H8802)} the wind{H7307} shall not sow{H2232}{(H8799)}; and he that regardeth{H7200}{(H8802)} the clouds{H5645} shall not reap{H7114}{(H8799)}.
Ecclesiastes,11,5,"As thou knowest{H3045}{(H8802)} not what is the way{H1870} of the spirit{H7307}, nor how the bones{H6106} do grow in the womb{H990} of her that is with child{H4392}: even so thou knowest{H3045}{(H8799)} not the works{H4639} of God{H430} who maketh{H6213}{(H8799)} all."
Ecclesiastes,11,6,"In the morning{H1242} sow{H2232}{(H8798)} thy seed{H2233}, and in the evening{H6153} withhold{H3240}{(H8686)} not thine hand{H3027}: for thou knowest{H3045}{(H8802)} not whether{H335} shall prosper{H3787}{(H8799)}, either this or that, or whether they both{H8147} shall be alike{H259} good{H2896}."
Ecclesiastes,11,7,"Truly the light{H216} is sweet{H4966}, and a pleasant{H2896} thing it is for the eyes{H5869} to behold{H7200}{(H8800)} the sun{H8121}:"
Ecclesiastes,11,8,"But if a man{H120} live{H2421}{(H8799)} many{H7235}{(H8687)} years{H8141}, and rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} in them all; yet let him remember{H2142}{(H8799)} the days{H3117} of darkness{H2822}; for they shall be many{H7235}{(H8687)}. All that cometh{H935}{(H8804)} is vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,11,9,"Rejoice{H8055}{(H8798)}, O young man{H970}, in thy youth{H3208}; and let thy heart{H3820} cheer{H2895}{(H8686)} thee in the days{H3117} of thy youth{H979}, and walk{H1980}{(H8761)} in the ways{H1870} of thine heart{H3820}, and in the sight{H4758} of thine eyes{H5869}: but know{H3045}{(H8798)} thou, that for all these things God{H430} will bring{H935}{(H8686)} thee into judgment{H4941}."
Ecclesiastes,11,10,"Therefore remove{H5493}{(H8685)} sorrow{H3708} from thy heart{H3820}, and put away{H5674}{(H8685)} evil{H7451} from thy flesh{H1320}: for childhood{H3208} and youth{H7839} are vanity{H1892}."
Ecclesiastes,12,1,"Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} now thy Creator{H1254}{(H8802)} in the days{H3117} of thy youth{H979}, while the evil{H7451} days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8799)} not, nor the years{H8141} draw nigh{H5060}{(H8689)}, when thou shalt say{H559}{(H8799)}, I have no pleasure{H2656} in them;"
Ecclesiastes,12,2,"While the sun{H8121}, or the light{H216}, or the moon{H3394}, or the stars{H3556}, be not darkened{H2821}{(H8799)}, nor the clouds{H5645} return{H7725}{(H8804)} after{H310} the rain{H1653}:"
Ecclesiastes,12,3,"In the day{H3117} when the keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the house{H1004} shall tremble{H2111}{(H8799)}, and the strong{H2428} men{H582} shall bow{H5791}{(H8694)} themselves, and the grinders{H2912}{(H8802)} cease{H988}{(H8804)} because they are few{H4591}{(H8765)}, and those that look out{H7200}{(H8802)} of the windows{H699} be darkened{H2821}{(H8804)},"

Song of Solomon,8,6,"Set{H7760}{(H8798)} me as a seal{H2368} upon thine heart{H3820}, as a seal{H2368} upon thine arm{H2220}: for love{H160} is strong{H5794} as death{H4194}; jealousy{H7068} is cruel{H7186} as the grave{H7585}: the coals{H7565} thereof are coals{H7565} of fire{H784}, which hath a most vehement flame{H7957}."

Isaiah,28,16,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, Behold, I lay{H3245}{(H8765)} in Zion{H6726} for a foundation a stone{H68}, a tried{H976} stone{H68}, a precious{H3368} corner{H6438} stone, a sure{H3245}{(H8716)} foundation{H4143}: he that believeth{H539}{(H8688)} shall not make haste{H2363}{(H8686)}."
Isaiah,28,17,"Judgment{H4941} also will I lay{H7760}{(H8804)} to the line{H6957}, and righteousness{H6666} to the plummet{H4949}: and the hail{H1259} shall sweep away{H3261}{(H8804)} the refuge{H4268} of lies{H3577}, and the waters{H4325} shall overflow{H7857}{(H8799)} the hiding place{H5643}."

Isaiah,28,22,"Now therefore be ye not mockers{H3887}{(H8698)}, lest your bands{H4147} be made strong{H2388}{(H8799)}: for I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} from the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} of hosts{H6635} a consumption{H3617}, even determined{H2782}{(H8737)} upon the whole earth{H776}."

Isaiah,28,28,"Bread{H3899} corn is bruised{H1854}{(H8714)}; because he will not ever{H5331} be threshing{H156}{(H8800)}{H1758}{(H8799)} it, nor break{H2000}{(H8804)} it with the wheel{H1536} of his cart{H5699}, nor bruise{H1854}{(H8799)} it with his horsemen{H6571}."

Isaiah,33,3,At the noise{H6963} of the tumult{H1995} the people{H5971} fled{H5074}{(H8804)}; at the lifting up{H7427} of thyself the nations{H1471} were scattered{H5310}{(H8804)}.
Isaiah,33,4,And your spoil{H7998} shall be gathered{H622}{(H8795)} like the gathering{H625} of the caterpiller{H2625}: as the running to and fro{H4944} of locusts{H1357} shall he run{H8264}{(H8802)} upon them.
Isaiah,33,5,The LORD{H3068} is exalted{H7682}{(H8737)}; for he dwelleth{H7931}{(H8802)} on high{H4791}: he hath filled{H4390}{(H8765)} Zion{H6726} with judgment{H4941} and righteousness{H6666}.
Isaiah,33,6,"And wisdom{H2451} and knowledge{H1847} shall be the stability{H530} of thy times{H6256}, and strength{H2633} of salvation{H3444}: the fear{H3374} of the LORD{H3068} is his treasure{H214}."
Isaiah,33,7,"Behold, their valiant ones{H691} shall cry{H6817}{(H8804)} without{H2351}: the ambassadors{H4397} of peace{H7965} shall weep{H1058}{(H8799)} bitterly{H4751}."
Isaiah,33,8,"The highways{H4546} lie waste{H8074}{(H8738)}, the wayfaring man{H5674}{(H8802)}{H734} ceaseth{H7673}{(H8804)}: he hath broken{H6565}{(H8689)} the covenant{H1285}, he hath despised{H3988}{(H8804)} the cities{H5892}, he regardeth{H2803}{(H8804)} no man{H582}."
Isaiah,33,9,The earth{H776} mourneth{H56}{(H8804)} and languisheth{H535}{(H8797)}: Lebanon{H3844} is ashamed{H2659}{(H8689)} and hewn down{H7060}{(H8804)}: Sharon{H8289} is like a wilderness{H6160}; and Bashan{H1316} and Carmel{H3760} shake off{H5287}{(H8802)} their fruits.
Isaiah,33,10,"Now will I rise{H6965}{(H8799)}, saith{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068}; now will I be exalted{H7426}{(H8735)}; now will I lift up{H5375}{(H8735)} myself."

Isaiah,33,12,And the people{H5971} shall be as the burnings{H4955} of lime{H7875}: as thorns{H6975} cut up{H3683}{(H8803)} shall they be burned{H3341}{(H8799)} in the fire{H784}.
Isaiah,33,13,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, ye that are far off{H7350}, what I have done{H6213}{(H8804)}; and, ye that are near{H7138}, acknowledge{H3045}{(H8798)} my might{H1369}."
Isaiah,33,14,The sinners{H2400} in Zion{H6726} are afraid{H6342}{(H8804)}; fearfulness{H7461} hath surprised{H270}{(H8804)} the hypocrites{H2611}. Who among us shall dwell{H1481}{(H8799)} with the devouring{H398}{(H8802)} fire{H784}? who among us shall dwell{H1481}{(H8799)} with everlasting{H5769} burnings{H4168}?
Isaiah,33,15,"He that walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} righteously{H6666}, and speaketh{H1696}{(H8802)} uprightly{H4339}; he that despiseth{H3988}{(H8802)} the gain{H1215} of oppressions{H4642}, that shaketh{H5287}{(H8802)} his hands{H3709} from holding{H8551}{(H8800)} of bribes{H7810}, that stoppeth{H331}{(H8801)} his ears{H241} from hearing{H8085}{(H8800)} of blood{H1818}, and shutteth{H6105}{(H8802)} his eyes{H5869} from seeing{H7200}{(H8800)} evil{H7451};"
Isaiah,33,16,He shall dwell{H7931}{(H8799)} on high{H4791}: his place of defence{H4869} shall be the munitions{H4679} of rocks{H5553}: bread{H3899} shall be given{H5414}{(H8737)} him; his waters{H4325} shall be sure{H539}{(H8737)}.
Isaiah,33,17,Thine eyes{H5869} shall see{H2372}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} in his beauty{H3308}: they shall behold{H7200}{(H8799)} the land{H776} that is very far off{H4801}.
Isaiah,33,18,Thine heart{H3820} shall meditate{H1897}{(H8799)} terror{H367}. Where is the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}? where is the receiver{H8254}{(H8802)}? where is he that counted{H5608}{(H8802)} the towers{H4026}?
Isaiah,33,19,"Thou shalt not see{H7200}{(H8799)} a fierce{H3267}{(H8737)} people{H5971}, a people{H5971} of a deeper{H6012} speech{H8193} than thou canst perceive{H8085}{(H8800)}; of a stammering{H3932}{(H8737)} tongue{H3956}, that thou canst not understand{H998}."
Isaiah,33,20,"Look{H2372}{(H8798)} upon Zion{H6726}, the city{H7151} of our solemnities{H4150}: thine eyes{H5869} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} Jerusalem{H3389} a quiet{H7600} habitation{H5116}, a tabernacle{H168} that shall not be taken down{H6813}{(H8799)}; not one of the stakes{H3489} thereof shall ever{H5331} be removed{H5265}{(H8799)}, neither shall any of the cords{H2256} thereof be broken{H5423}{(H8735)}."

Isaiah,33,24,"And the inhabitant{H7934} shall not say{H559}{(H8799)}, I am sick{H2470}{(H8804)}: the people{H5971} that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein shall be forgiven{H5375}{(H8803)} their iniquity{H5771}."
Isaiah,34,1,"Come near{H7126}{(H8798)}, ye nations{H1471}, to hear{H8085}{(H8800)}; and hearken{H7181}{(H8685)}, ye people{H3816}: let the earth{H776} hear{H8085}{(H8799)}, and all that is therein{H4393}; the world{H8398}, and all things that come forth{H6631} of it."

Isaiah,53,4,"Surely{H403} he hath borne{H5375}{(H8804)} our griefs{H2483}, and carried{H5445}{(H8804)} our sorrows{H4341}: yet we did esteem{H2803}{(H8804)} him stricken{H5060}{(H8803)}, smitten{H5221}{(H8716)} of God{H430}, and afflicted{H6031}{(H8794)}."
Isaiah,53,5,"But he was wounded{H2490}{(H8775)} for our transgressions{H6588}, he was bruised{H1792}{(H8794)} for our iniquities{H5771}: the chastisement{H4148} of our peace{H7965} was upon him; and with his stripes{H2250} we are healed{H7495}{(H8738)}."

Isaiah,53,7,"He was oppressed{H5065}{(H8738)}, and he was afflicted{H6031}{(H8737)}, yet he opened{H6605}{(H8799)} not his mouth{H6310}: he is brought{H2986}{(H8714)} as a lamb{H7716} to the slaughter{H2874}, and as a sheep{H7353} before{H6440} her shearers{H1494}{(H8802)} is dumb{H481}{(H8738)}, so he openeth{H6605}{(H8799)} not his mouth{H6310}."
Isaiah,53,8,He was taken{H3947}{(H8795)} from prison{H6115} and from judgment{H4941}: and who shall declare{H7878}{(H8787)} his generation{H1755}? for he was cut off{H1504}{(H8738)} out of the land{H776} of the living{H2416}: for the transgression{H6588} of my people{H5971} was he stricken{H5061}.
Isaiah,53,9,"And he made{H5414}{(H8799)} his grave{H6913} with the wicked{H7563}, and with the rich{H6223} in his death{H4194}; because he had done{H6213}{(H8804)} no violence{H2555}, neither was any deceit{H4820} in his mouth{H6310}."
Isaiah,53,10,"Yet it pleased{H2654}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} to bruise{H1792}{(H8763)} him; he hath put him to grief{H2470}{(H8689)}: when thou shalt make{H7760}{(H8799)} his soul{H5315} an offering for sin{H817}, he shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} his seed{H2233}, he shall prolong{H748}{(H8686)} his days{H3117}, and the pleasure{H2656} of the LORD{H3068} shall prosper{H6743}{(H8799)} in his hand{H3027}."
Isaiah,53,11,"He shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} of the travail{H5999} of his soul{H5315}, and shall be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)}: by his knowledge{H1847} shall my righteous{H6662} servant{H5650} justify{H6663}{(H8686)} many{H7227}; for he shall bear{H5445}{(H8799)} their iniquities{H5771}."

Isaiah,58,13,"If thou turn away{H7725}{(H8686)} thy foot{H7272} from the sabbath{H7676}, from doing{H6213}{(H8800)} thy pleasure{H2656} on my holy{H6944} day{H3117}; and call{H7121}{(H8804)} the sabbath{H7676} a delight{H6027}, the holy{H6918} of the LORD{H3068}, honourable{H3513}{(H8794)}; and shalt honour{H3513}{(H8765)} him, not doing{H6213}{(H8800)} thine own ways{H1870}, nor finding{H4672}{(H8800)} thine own pleasure{H2656}, nor speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} thine own words{H1697}:"
Isaiah,58,14,"Then shalt thou delight{H6026}{(H8691)} thyself in the LORD{H3068}; and I will cause thee to ride{H7392}{(H8689)} upon the high places{H1116} of the earth{H776}, and feed{H398}{(H8689)} thee with the heritage{H5159} of Jacob{H3290} thy father{H1}: for the mouth{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Isaiah,59,1,"Behold{H2005}, the LORD'S{H3068} hand{H3027} is not shortened{H7114}{(H8804)}, that it cannot save{H3467}{(H8687)}; neither his ear{H241} heavy{H3513}{(H8804)}, that it cannot hear{H8085}{(H8800)}:"
Isaiah,59,2,"But your iniquities{H5771} have separated{H914}{(H8688)} between{H996} you and your God{H430}, and your sins{H2403} have hid{H5641}{(H8689)} his face{H6440} from you, that he will not hear{H8085}{(H8800)}."
Isaiah,59,3,"For your hands{H3709} are defiled{H1351}{(H8738)} with blood{H1818}, and your fingers{H676} with iniquity{H5771}; your lips{H8193} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} lies{H8267}, your tongue{H3956} hath muttered{H1897}{(H8799)} perverseness{H5766}."
Isaiah,59,4,"None calleth{H7121}{(H8802)} for justice{H6664}, nor any pleadeth{H8199}{(H8737)} for truth{H530}: they trust{H982}{(H8800)} in vanity{H8414}, and speak{H1696}{(H8763)} lies{H7723}; they conceive{H2029}{(H8800)} mischief{H5999}, and bring forth{H3205}{(H8687)} iniquity{H205}."
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch{H1234}{(H8765)} cockatrice{H6848}' eggs{H1000}, and weave{H707}{(H8799)} the spider's{H5908} web{H6980}: he that eateth{H398}{(H8802)} of their eggs{H1000} dieth{H4191}{(H8799)}, and that which is crushed{H2116} breaketh out{H1234}{(H8735)} into a viper{H660}."
Isaiah,59,6,"Their webs{H6980} shall not become garments{H899}, neither shall they cover{H3680}{(H8691)} themselves with their works{H4639}: their works{H4639} are works{H4639} of iniquity{H205}, and the act{H6467} of violence{H2555} is in their hands{H3709}."
Isaiah,59,7,"Their feet{H7272} run{H7323}{(H8799)} to evil{H7451}, and they make haste{H4116}{(H8762)} to shed{H8210}{(H8800)} innocent{H5355} blood{H1818}: their thoughts{H4284} are thoughts{H4284} of iniquity{H205}; wasting{H7701} and destruction{H7667} are in their paths{H4546}."
Isaiah,59,8,The way{H1870} of peace{H7965} they know{H3045}{(H8804)} not; and there is no judgment{H4941} in their goings{H4570}: they have made them crooked{H6140}{(H8765)} paths{H5410}: whosoever goeth{H1869}{(H8802)} therein shall not know{H3045}{(H8804)} peace{H7965}.
Isaiah,59,9,"Therefore is judgment{H4941} far{H7368}{(H8804)} from us, neither doth justice{H6666} overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} us: we wait{H6960}{(H8762)} for light{H216}, but behold obscurity{H2822}; for brightness{H5054}, but we walk{H1980}{(H8762)} in darkness{H653}."
Isaiah,59,10,"We grope{H1659}{(H8762)} for the wall{H7023} like the blind{H5787}, and we grope{H1659}{(H8762)} as if we had no eyes{H5869}: we stumble{H3782}{(H8804)} at noonday{H6672} as in the night{H5399}; we are in desolate{H820} places as dead{H4191}{(H8801)} men."
Isaiah,59,11,"We roar{H1993}{(H8799)} all like bears{H1677}, and mourn{H1897}{(H8799)} sore{H1897}{(H8800)} like doves{H3123}: we look{H6960}{(H8762)} for judgment{H4941}, but there is none; for salvation{H3444}, but it is far off{H7368}{(H8804)} from us."
Isaiah,59,12,"For our transgressions{H6588} are multiplied{H7231}{(H8804)} before thee, and our sins{H2403} testify{H6030}{(H8804)} against us: for our transgressions{H6588} are with us; and as for our iniquities{H5771}, we know{H3045}{(H8804)} them;"
Isaiah,59,13,"In transgressing{H6586}{(H8800)} and lying{H3584}{(H8763)} against the LORD{H3068}, and departing away{H5253}{(H8800)} from{H310} our God{H430}, speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} oppression{H6233} and revolt{H5627}, conceiving{H2029}{(H8780)} and uttering{H1897}{(H8774)} from the heart{H3820} words{H1697} of falsehood{H8267}."
Isaiah,59,14,"And judgment{H4941} is turned away{H5253}{(H8717)} backward{H268}, and justice{H6666} standeth{H5975}{(H8799)} afar off{H7350}: for truth{H571} is fallen{H3782}{(H8804)} in the street{H7339}, and equity{H5229} cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} enter{H935}{(H8800)}."
Isaiah,59,15,"Yea, truth{H571} faileth{H5737}{(H8737)}; and he that departeth{H5493}{(H8804)} from evil{H7451} maketh himself a prey{H7997}{(H8711)}: and the LORD{H3068} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} it, and it displeased{H3415}{(H8799)}{H5869} him that there was no judgment{H4941}."
Isaiah,59,16,"And he saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that there was no man{H376}, and wondered{H8074}{(H8709)} that there was no intercessor{H6293}{(H8688)}: therefore his arm{H2220} brought salvation{H3467}{(H8686)} unto him; and his righteousness{H6666}, it sustained{H5564}{(H8804)} him."
Isaiah,59,17,"For he put on{H3847}{(H8799)} righteousness{H6666} as a breastplate{H8302}, and an helmet{H3553} of salvation{H3444} upon his head{H7218}; and he put on{H3847}{(H8799)} the garments{H899} of vengeance{H5359} for clothing{H8516}, and was clad{H5844}{(H8799)} with zeal{H7068} as a cloke{H4598}."
Isaiah,59,18,"According to{H5921} their deeds{H1578}, accordingly he will repay{H7999}{(H8762)}, fury{H2534} to his adversaries{H6862}, recompence{H1576} to his enemies{H341}{(H8802)}; to the islands{H339} he will repay{H7999}{(H8762)} recompence{H1576}."
Isaiah,59,19,"So shall they fear{H3372}{(H8799)} the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068} from the west{H4628}, and his glory{H3519} from the rising{H4217} of the sun{H8121}. When the enemy{H6862} shall come in{H935}{(H8799)} like a flood{H5104}, the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} shall lift up a standard{H5127}{(H8790)} against him."
Isaiah,59,20,"And the Redeemer{H1350}{(H8802)} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} to Zion{H6726}, and unto them that turn{H7725}{(H8802)} from transgression{H6588} in Jacob{H3290}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Isaiah,59,21,"As for me, this is my covenant{H1285} with them, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; My spirit{H7307} that is upon thee, and my words{H1697} which I have put{H7760}{(H8804)} in thy mouth{H6310}, shall not depart{H4185}{(H8799)} out of thy mouth{H6310}, nor out of the mouth{H6310} of thy seed{H2233}, nor out of the mouth{H6310} of thy seed's{H2233} seed{H2233}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, from henceforth and for{H5704} ever{H5769}."

Yea, they have chosen{H977}{(H8804)} their own ways{H1870}, and their soul{H5315} delighteth{H2654}{(H8804)} in their abominations{H8251}."
Isaiah,66,4,"I also will choose{H977}{(H8799)} their delusions{H8586}, and will bring{H935}{(H8686)} their fears{H4035} upon them; because when I called{H7121}{(H8804)}, none did answer{H6030}{(H8802)}; when I spake{H1696}{(H8765)}, they did not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}: but they did{H6213}{(H8799)} evil{H7451} before mine eyes{H5869}, and chose{H977}{(H8804)} that in which I delighted{H2654}{(H8804)} not."

Jeremiah,2,36,"Why gaddest thou about{H235}{(H8799)} so much{H3966} to change{H8138}{(H8763)} thy way{H1870}? thou also shalt be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)} of Egypt{H4714}, as thou wast ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} of Assyria{H804}."
Jeremiah,2,37,"Yea, thou shalt go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} from him, and thine hands{H3027} upon thine head{H7218}: for the LORD{H3068} hath rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} thy confidences{H4009}, and thou shalt not prosper{H6743}{(H8686)} in them."

Jeremiah,3,21,"A voice{H6963} was heard{H8085}{(H8738)} upon the high places{H8205}, weeping{H1065} and supplications{H8469} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}: for they have perverted{H5753}{(H8689)} their way{H1870}, and they have forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}."
Jeremiah,3,22,"Return{H7725}{(H8798)}, ye backsliding{H7726} children{H1121}, and I will heal{H7495}{(H8799)} your backslidings{H4878}. Behold, we come{H857}{(H8804)} unto thee; for thou art the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Jeremiah,3,23,"Truly{H403} in vain{H8267} is salvation hoped for from the hills{H1389}, and from the multitude{H1995} of mountains{H2022}: truly{H403} in the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} is the salvation{H8668} of Israel{H3478}."
Jeremiah,3,24,"For shame{H1322} hath devoured{H398}{(H8804)} the labour{H3018} of our fathers{H1} from our youth{H5271}; their flocks{H6629} and their herds{H1241}, their sons{H1121} and their daughters{H1323}."
Jeremiah,3,25,"We lie down{H7901}{(H8799)} in our shame{H1322}, and our confusion{H3639} covereth{H3680}{(H8762)} us: for we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, we and our fathers{H1}, from our youth{H5271} even unto this day{H3117}, and have not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Jeremiah,4,1,"If thou wilt return{H7725}{(H8799)}, O Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto me: and if thou wilt put away{H5493}{(H8686)} thine abominations{H8251} out of my sight{H6440}, then shalt thou not remove{H5110}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,4,2,"And thou shalt swear{H7650}{(H8738)}, The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, in truth{H571}, in judgment{H4941}, and in righteousness{H6666}; and the nations{H1471} shall bless{H1288}{(H8694)} themselves in him, and in him shall they glory{H1984}{(H8691)}."
Jeremiah,4,3,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} to the men{H376} of Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, Break up{H5214}{(H8798)} your fallow ground{H5215}, and sow{H2232}{(H8799)} not among thorns{H6975}."
Jeremiah,4,4,"Circumcise{H4135}{(H8734)} yourselves to the LORD{H3068}, and take away{H5493}{(H8685)} the foreskins{H6190} of your heart{H3824}, ye men{H376} of Judah{H3063} and inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}: lest my fury{H2534} come forth{H3318}{(H8799)} like fire{H784}, and burn{H1197}{(H8804)} that none can quench{H3518}{(H8764)} it, because{H6440} of the evil{H7455} of your doings{H4611}."
Jeremiah,4,5,"Declare{H5046}{(H8685)} ye in Judah{H3063}, and publish{H8085}{(H8685)} in Jerusalem{H3389}; and say{H559}{(H8798)}, Blow{H8628}{(H8798)} ye the trumpet{H7782} in the land{H776}: cry{H7121}{(H8798)}, gather together{H4390}{(H8761)}, and say{H559}{(H8798)}, Assemble{H622}{(H8734)} yourselves, and let us go{H935}{(H8799)} into the defenced{H4013} cities{H5892}."
Jeremiah,4,6,"Set up{H5375}{(H8798)} the standard{H5251} toward Zion{H6726}: retire{H5756}{(H8685)}, stay{H5975}{(H8799)} not: for I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} from the north{H6828}, and a great{H1419} destruction{H7667}."
Jeremiah,4,7,"The lion{H738} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} from his thicket{H5441}, and the destroyer{H7843}{(H8688)} of the Gentiles{H1471} is on his way{H5265}{(H8804)}; he is gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)} from his place{H4725} to make{H7760}{(H8800)} thy land{H776} desolate{H8047}; and thy cities{H5892} shall be laid waste{H5327}{(H8799)}, without an inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,4,8,"For this gird{H2296}{(H8798)} you with sackcloth{H8242}, lament{H5594}{(H8798)} and howl{H3213}{(H8685)}: for the fierce{H2740} anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} is not turned back{H7725}{(H8804)} from us."
Jeremiah,4,9,"And it shall come to pass at that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that the heart{H3820} of the king{H4428} shall perish{H6}{(H8799)}, and the heart{H3820} of the princes{H8269}; and the priests{H3548} shall be astonished{H8074}{(H8738)}, and the prophets{H5030} shall wonder{H8539}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,4,10,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, Ah{H162}, Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}! surely{H403} thou hast greatly{H5377}{(H8687)} deceived{H5377}{(H8689)} this people{H5971} and Jerusalem{H3389}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye shall have peace{H7965}; whereas the sword{H2719} reacheth{H5060}{(H8804)} unto the soul{H5315}."
Jeremiah,4,11,"At that time{H6256} shall it be said{H559}{(H8735)} to this people{H5971} and to Jerusalem{H3389}, A dry{H6703} wind{H7307} of the high places{H8205} in the wilderness{H4057} toward{H1870} the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971}, not to fan{H2219}{(H8800)}, nor to cleanse{H1305}{(H8687)},"
Jeremiah,4,12,Even a full{H4392} wind{H7307} from those places shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto me: now also will I give{H1696}{(H8762)} sentence{H4941} against them.
Jeremiah,4,13,"Behold, he shall come up{H5927}{(H8799)} as clouds{H6051}, and his chariots{H4818} shall be as a whirlwind{H5492}: his horses{H5483} are swifter{H7043}{(H8804)} than eagles{H5404}. Woe{H188} unto us! for we are spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}."
Jeremiah,4,14,"O Jerusalem{H3389}, wash{H3526}{(H8761)} thine heart{H3820} from wickedness{H7451}, that thou mayest be saved{H3467}{(H8735)}. How long shall thy vain{H205} thoughts{H4284} lodge{H3885}{(H8686)} within{H7130} thee?"
Jeremiah,4,15,"For a voice{H6963} declareth{H5046}{(H8688)} from Dan{H1835}, and publisheth{H8085}{(H8688)} affliction{H205} from mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669}."
Jeremiah,4,16,"Make ye mention{H2142}{(H8685)} to the nations{H1471}; behold, publish{H8085}{(H8685)} against Jerusalem{H3389}, that watchers{H5341}{(H8802)} come{H935}{(H8802)} from a far{H4801} country{H776}, and give out{H5414}{(H8799)} their voice{H6963} against the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}."
Jeremiah,4,17,"As keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of a field{H7704}, are they against her round about{H5439}; because she hath been rebellious{H4784}{(H8804)} against me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,4,18,"Thy way{H1870} and thy doings{H4611} have procured{H6213}{(H8804)} these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness{H7451}, because it is bitter{H4751}, because it reacheth{H5060}{(H8804)} unto thine heart{H3820}."
Jeremiah,4,19,"My bowels{H4578}, my bowels{H4578}! I am pained{H2342}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H3176}{(H8686)} at my very{H7023} heart{H3820}; my heart{H3820} maketh a noise{H1993}{(H8802)} in me; I cannot hold my peace{H2790}{(H8686)}, because thou hast heard{H8085}{(H8804)}, O my soul{H5315}, the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, the alarm{H8643} of war{H4421}."
Jeremiah,4,20,"Destruction{H7667} upon destruction{H7667} is cried{H7121}{(H8738)}; for the whole land{H776} is spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}: suddenly{H6597} are my tents{H168} spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}, and my curtains{H3407} in a moment{H7281}."
Jeremiah,4,21,"How long shall I see{H7200}{(H8799)} the standard{H5251}, and hear{H8085}{(H8799)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}?"
Jeremiah,4,22,"For my people{H5971} is foolish{H191}, they have not known{H3045}{(H8804)} me; they are sottish{H5530} children{H1121}, and they have none understanding{H995}{(H8737)}: they are wise{H2450} to do evil{H7489}{(H8687)}, but to do good{H3190}{(H8687)} they have no knowledge{H3045}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,4,23,"I beheld{H7200}{(H8804)} the earth{H776}, and, lo, it was without form{H8414}, and void{H922}; and the heavens{H8064}, and they had no light{H216}."
Jeremiah,4,24,"I beheld{H7200}{(H8804)} the mountains{H2022}, and, lo, they trembled{H7493}{(H8801)}, and all the hills{H1389} moved lightly{H7043}{(H8701)}."
Jeremiah,4,25,"I beheld{H7200}{(H8804)}, and, lo, there was no man{H120}, and all the birds{H5775} of the heavens{H8064} were fled{H5074}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,4,26,"I beheld{H7200}{(H8804)}, and, lo, the fruitful place{H3759} was a wilderness{H4057}, and all the cities{H5892} thereof were broken down{H5422}{(H8738)} at the presence{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}, and by his fierce{H2740} anger{H639}."
Jeremiah,4,27,"For thus hath the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8804)}, The whole land{H776} shall be desolate{H8077}; yet will I not make{H6213}{(H8799)} a full end{H3617}."
Jeremiah,4,28,"For this shall the earth{H776} mourn{H56}{(H8799)}, and the heavens{H8064} above{H4605} be black{H6937}{(H8804)}: because I have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it, I have purposed{H2161}{(H8804)} it, and will not repent{H5162}{(H8738)}, neither will I turn back{H7725}{(H8799)} from it."
Jeremiah,4,29,"The whole city{H5892} shall flee{H1272}{(H8802)} for the noise{H6963} of the horsemen{H6571} and bowmen{H7198}{H7411}{(H8802)}; they shall go{H935}{(H8804)} into thickets{H5645}, and climb up{H5927}{(H8804)} upon the rocks{H3710}: every city{H5892} shall be forsaken{H5800}{(H8803)}, and not a man{H376} dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein{H2004}."
Jeremiah,4,30,"And when thou art spoiled{H7703}{(H8803)}, what wilt thou do{H6213}{(H8799)}? Though thou clothest{H3847}{(H8799)} thyself with crimson{H8144}, though thou deckest{H5710}{(H8799)} thee with ornaments{H5716} of gold{H2091}, though thou rentest{H7167}{(H8799)} thy face{H5869} with painting{H6320}, in vain{H7723} shalt thou make thyself fair{H3302}{(H8691)}; thy lovers{H5689}{(H8802)} will despise{H3988}{(H8804)} thee, they will seek{H1245}{(H8762)} thy life{H5315}."
Jeremiah,4,31,"For I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} a voice{H6963} as of a woman in travail{H2470}{(H8802)}, and the anguish{H6869} as of her that bringeth forth her first child{H1069}{(H8688)}, the voice{H6963} of the daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}, that bewaileth{H3306}{(H8691)} herself, that spreadeth{H6566}{(H8762)} her hands{H3709}, saying, Woe{H188} is me now! for my soul{H5315} is wearied{H5888}{(H8804)} because of murderers{H2026}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,5,1,"Run ye to and fro{H7751}{(H8786)} through the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} now, and know{H3045}{(H8798)}, and seek{H1245}{(H8761)} in the broad places{H7339} thereof, if ye can find{H4672}{(H8799)} a man{H376}, if there be{H3426} any that executeth{H6213}{(H8802)} judgment{H4941}, that seeketh{H1245}{(H8764)} the truth{H530}; and I will pardon{H5545}{(H8799)} it."
Jeremiah,5,2,"And though they say{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}; surely they swear{H7650}{(H8735)} falsely{H8267}."
Jeremiah,5,3,"O LORD{H3068}, are not thine eyes{H5869} upon the truth{H530}? thou hast stricken{H5221}{(H8689)} them, but they have not grieved{H2342}{(H8804)}; thou hast consumed{H3615}{(H8765)} them, but they have refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to receive{H3947}{(H8800)} correction{H4148}: they have made their faces{H6440} harder{H2388}{(H8765)} than a rock{H5553}; they have refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to return{H7725}{(H8800)}."
Jeremiah,5,4,"Therefore I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Surely these are poor{H1800}; they are foolish{H2973}{(H8738)}: for they know{H3045}{(H8804)} not the way{H1870} of the LORD{H3068}, nor the judgment{H4941} of their God{H430}."
Jeremiah,5,5,"I will get{H3212}{(H8799)} me unto the great men{H1419}, and will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them; for they have known{H3045}{(H8804)} the way{H1870} of the LORD{H3068}, and the judgment{H4941} of their God{H430}: but these have altogether{H3162} broken{H7665}{(H8804)} the yoke{H5923}, and burst{H5423}{(H8765)} the bonds{H4147}."
Jeremiah,5,6,"Wherefore a lion{H738} out of the forest{H3293} shall slay{H5221}{(H8689)} them, and a wolf{H2061} of the evenings{H6160} shall spoil{H7703}{(H8799)} them, a leopard{H5246} shall watch{H8245}{(H8802)} over their cities{H5892}: every one that goeth out{H3318}{(H8802)} thence shall{H2007} be torn in pieces{H2963}{(H8735)}: because their transgressions{H6588} are many{H7231}{(H8804)}, and their backslidings{H4878} are increased{H6105}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,5,7,"How{H335} shall I pardon{H5545}{(H8799)} thee for this{H2063}? thy children{H1121} have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, and sworn{H7650}{(H8735)} by them that are no{H3808} gods{H430}: when I had fed them to the full{H7650}{(H8686)}, they then committed adultery{H5003}{(H8799)}, and assembled themselves by troops{H1413}{(H8704)} in the harlots{H2181}{(H8802)}' houses{H1004}."
Jeremiah,5,8,They were as fed{H2109}{(H8716)} horses{H5483} in the morning{H7904}{(H8688)}: every one{H376} neighed{H6670}{(H8799)} after his neighbour's{H7453} wife{H802}.
Jeremiah,5,9,Shall I not visit{H6485}{(H8799)} for these things? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: and shall not my soul{H5315} be avenged{H5358}{(H8691)} on such a nation{H1471} as this?
Jeremiah,5,10,"Go ye up{H5927}{(H8798)} upon her walls{H8284}, and destroy{H7843}{(H8761)}; but make{H6213}{(H8799)} not a full end{H3617}: take away{H5493}{(H8685)} her battlements{H5189}; for they are not the LORD'S{H3068}."
Jeremiah,5,11,"For the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} have dealt very{H898}{(H8800)} treacherously{H898}{(H8804)} against me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,5,12,"They have belied{H3584}{(H8765)} the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, It is not he; neither shall evil{H7451} come{H935}{(H8799)} upon us; neither shall we see{H7200}{(H8799)} sword{H2719} nor famine{H7458}:"
Jeremiah,5,13,"And the prophets{H5030} shall become wind{H7307}, and the word{H1696}{(H8763)} is not in them: thus shall it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} unto them."
Jeremiah,5,14,"Wherefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, Because ye speak{H1696}{(H8763)} this word{H1697}, behold, I will make{H5414}{(H8802)} my words{H1697} in thy mouth{H6310} fire{H784}, and this people{H5971} wood{H6086}, and it shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} them."
Jeremiah,5,15,"Lo, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} a nation{H1471} upon you from far{H4801}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: it is a mighty{H386} nation{H1471}, it is an ancient{H5769} nation{H1471}, a nation{H1471} whose language{H3956} thou knowest{H3045}{(H8799)} not, neither understandest{H8085}{(H8799)} what they say{H1696}{(H8762)}."
Jeremiah,5,16,"Their quiver{H827} is as an open{H6605}{(H8803)} sepulchre{H6913}, they are all mighty men{H1368}."
Jeremiah,5,17,"And they shall eat up{H398}{(H8804)} thine harvest{H7105}, and thy bread{H3899}, which thy sons{H1121} and thy daughters{H1323} should eat{H398}{(H8799)}: they shall eat up{H398}{(H8799)} thy flocks{H6629} and thine herds{H1241}: they shall eat up{H398}{(H8799)} thy vines{H1612} and thy fig trees{H8384}: they shall impoverish{H7567}{(H8779)} thy fenced{H4013} cities{H5892}, wherein thou{H2007} trustedst{H982}{(H8802)}, with the sword{H2719}."
Jeremiah,5,18,"Nevertheless in those days{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, I will not make{H6213}{(H8799)} a full end{H3617} with you."
Jeremiah,5,19,"And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say{H559}{(H8799)}, Wherefore{H8478}{H4100} doeth{H6213}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer{H559}{(H8804)} them, Like as ye have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, and served{H5647}{(H8799)} strange{H5236} gods{H430} in your land{H776}, so shall ye serve{H5647}{(H8799)} strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} in a land{H776} that is not yours."
Jeremiah,5,20,"Declare{H5046}{(H8685)} this in the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290}, and publish{H8085}{(H8685)} it in Judah{H3063}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,5,21,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now this, O foolish{H5530} people{H5971}, and without understanding{H3820}; which have eyes{H5869}, and see{H7200}{(H8799)} not; which have ears{H241}, and hear{H8085}{(H8799)} not:"
Jeremiah,5,22,"Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} ye not me? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: will ye not tremble{H2342}{(H8799)} at my presence{H6440}, which have placed{H7760}{(H8804)} the sand{H2344} for the bound{H1366} of the sea{H3220} by a perpetual{H5769} decree{H2706}, that it cannot pass{H5674}{(H8799)} it: and though the waves{H1530} thereof toss{H1607}{(H8691)} themselves, yet can they not prevail{H3201}{(H8799)}; though they roar{H1993}{(H8804)}, yet can they not pass over{H5674}{(H8799)} it?"
Jeremiah,5,23,But this people{H5971} hath a revolting{H5637}{(H8802)} and a rebellious{H4784}{(H8802)} heart{H3820}; they are revolted{H5493}{(H8804)} and gone{H3212}{(H8799)}.
Jeremiah,5,24,"Neither say{H559}{(H8804)} they in their heart{H3824}, Let us now fear{H3372}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, that giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} rain{H1653}, both the former{H3138} and the latter{H4456}, in his season{H6256}: he reserveth{H8104}{(H8799)} unto us the appointed{H2708} weeks{H7620} of the harvest{H7105}."
Jeremiah,5,25,"Your iniquities{H5771} have turned away{H5186}{(H8689)} these things, and your sins{H2403} have withholden{H4513}{(H8804)} good{H2896} things from you."
Jeremiah,5,26,"For among my people{H5971} are found{H4672}{(H8738)} wicked{H7563} men: they lay wait{H7789}{(H8799)}, as he that setteth{H7918}{(H8800)} snares{H3353}; they set{H5324}{(H8689)} a trap{H4889}, they catch{H3920}{(H8799)} men{H582}."
Jeremiah,5,27,"As a cage{H3619} is full{H4392} of birds{H5775}, so are their houses{H1004} full{H4392} of deceit{H4820}: therefore they are become great{H1431}{(H8804)}, and waxen rich{H6238}{(H8686)}."
Jeremiah,5,28,"They are waxen fat{H8080}{(H8804)}, they shine{H6245}{(H8804)}: yea, they overpass{H5674}{(H8804)} the deeds{H1697} of the wicked{H7451}: they judge{H1777}{(H8804)} not the cause{H1779}, the cause of the fatherless{H3490}, yet they prosper{H6743}{(H8686)}; and the right{H4941} of the needy{H34} do they not judge{H8199}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,5,29,Shall I not visit{H6485}{(H8799)} for these things? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: shall not my soul{H5315} be avenged{H5358}{(H8691)} on such a nation{H1471} as this?
Jeremiah,5,30,A wonderful{H8047} and horrible thing{H8186} is committed{H1961}{(H8738)} in the land{H776};
Jeremiah,5,31,"The prophets{H5030} prophesy{H5012}{(H8738)} falsely{H8267}, and the priests{H3548} bear rule{H7287}{(H8799)} by their means{H3027}; and my people{H5971} love{H157}{(H8804)} to have it so: and what will ye do{H6213}{(H8799)} in the end{H319} thereof?"
Jeremiah,6,1,"O ye children{H1121} of Benjamin{H1144}, gather yourselves to flee{H5756}{(H8685)} out of the midst{H7130} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and blow{H8628}{(H8798)} the trumpet{H7782} in Tekoa{H8620}, and set up{H5375}{(H8798)} a sign{H4864} of fire in Bethhaccerem{H1021}: for evil{H7451} appeareth{H8259}{(H8738)} out of the north{H6828}, and great{H1419} destruction{H7667}."
Jeremiah,6,2,I have likened{H1820}{(H8804)} the daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726} to a comely{H5116} and delicate{H6026}{(H8794)} woman.
Jeremiah,6,3,The shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} with their flocks{H5739} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto her; they shall pitch{H8628}{(H8804)} their tents{H168} against her round about{H5439}; they shall feed{H7462}{(H8804)} every one{H376} in his place{H3027}.
Jeremiah,6,4,"Prepare{H6942}{(H8761)} ye war{H4421} against her; arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, and let us go up{H5927}{(H8799)} at noon{H6672}. Woe{H188} unto us! for the day{H3117} goeth away{H6437}{(H8804)}, for the shadows{H6752} of the evening{H6153} are stretched out{H5186}{(H8735)}."
Jeremiah,6,5,"Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, and let us go{H5927}{(H8799)} by night{H3915}, and let us destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} her palaces{H759}."
Jeremiah,6,6,"For thus hath the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} said{H559}{(H8804)}, Hew ye down{H3772}{(H8798)} trees{H6097}, and cast{H8210}{(H8798)} a mount{H5550} against Jerusalem{H3389}: this is the city{H5892} to be visited{H6485}{(H8717)}; she is wholly oppression{H6233} in the midst{H7130} of her."
Jeremiah,6,7,"As a fountain{H953} casteth out{H6979}{(H8687)} her waters{H4325}, so she casteth out{H6979}{(H8689)} her wickedness{H7451}: violence{H2555} and spoil{H7701} is heard{H8085}{(H8735)} in her; before me{H6440} continually{H8548} is grief{H2483} and wounds{H4347}."
Jeremiah,6,8,"Be thou instructed{H3256}{(H8734)}, O Jerusalem{H3389}, lest my soul{H5315} depart{H3363}{(H8799)} from thee; lest I make{H7760}{(H8799)} thee desolate{H8077}, a land{H776} not inhabited{H3427}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,6,9,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, They shall throughly{H5953}{(H8780)} glean{H5953}{(H8779)} the remnant{H7611} of Israel{H3478} as a vine{H1612}: turn back{H7725}{(H8685)} thine hand{H3027} as a grapegatherer{H1219}{(H8802)} into the baskets{H5552}."
Jeremiah,6,10,"To whom shall I speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, and give warning{H5749}{(H8686)}, that they may hear{H8085}{(H8799)}? behold, their ear{H241} is uncircumcised{H6189}, and they cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} hearken{H7181}{(H8687)}: behold, the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} is unto them a reproach{H2781}; they have no delight{H2654}{(H8799)} in it."
Jeremiah,6,11,"Therefore I am full{H4392} of the fury{H2534} of the LORD{H3068}; I am weary{H3811}{(H8738)} with holding in{H3557}{(H8687)}: I will pour it out{H8210}{(H8800)} upon the children{H5768} abroad{H2351}, and upon the assembly{H5475} of young men{H970} together{H3162}: for even the husband{H376} with the wife{H802} shall be taken{H3920}{(H8735)}, the aged{H2205} with him that is full{H4390}{(H8804)} of days{H3117}."
Jeremiah,6,12,"And their houses{H1004} shall be turned{H5437}{(H8738)} unto others{H312}, with their fields{H7704} and wives{H802} together{H3162}: for I will stretch out{H5186}{(H8686)} my hand{H3027} upon the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,6,13,For from the least{H6996} of them even unto the greatest{H1419} of them every one is given{H1214}{(H8802)} to covetousness{H1215}; and from the prophet{H5030} even unto the priest{H3548} every one dealeth{H6213}{(H8802)} falsely{H8267}.
Jeremiah,6,14,"They have healed{H7495}{(H8762)} also the hurt{H7667} of the daughter{H1323}{(H8676)} of my people{H5971} slightly{H7043}{(H8738)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Peace{H7965}, peace{H7965}; when there is no peace{H7965}."
Jeremiah,6,15,"Were they ashamed{H3001}{(H8689)} when they had committed{H6213}{(H8804)} abomination{H8441}? nay{H1571}, they were not at all{H954}{(H8800)} ashamed{H954}{(H8799)}, neither{H1571} could{H3045}{(H8804)} they blush{H3637}{(H8687)}: therefore they shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} among them that fall{H5307}{(H8802)}: at the time{H6256} that I visit{H6485}{(H8804)} them they shall be cast down{H3782}{(H8735)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,6,16,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Stand{H5975}{(H8798)} ye in the ways{H1870}, and see{H7200}{(H8799)}, and ask{H7592}{(H8798)} for the old{H5769} paths{H5410}, where is the good{H2896} way{H1870}, and walk{H3212}{(H8799)} therein, and ye shall find{H4672}{(H8798)} rest{H4771} for your souls{H5315}. But they said{H559}{(H8799)}, We will not walk{H3212}{(H8798)} therein."
Jeremiah,6,17,"Also I set{H6965}{(H8689)} watchmen{H6822}{(H8802)} over you, saying, Hearken{H7181}{(H8685)} to the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}. But they said{H559}{(H8799)}, We will not hearken{H7181}{(H8686)}."
Jeremiah,6,18,"Therefore hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, ye nations{H1471}, and know{H3045}{(H8798)}, O congregation{H5712}, what is among them."
Jeremiah,6,19,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)}, O earth{H776}: behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} upon this people{H5971}, even the fruit{H6529} of their thoughts{H4284}, because they have not hearkened{H7181}{(H8689)} unto my words{H1697}, nor to my law{H8451}, but rejected{H3988}{(H8799)} it."
Jeremiah,6,20,"To what purpose cometh{H935}{(H8799)} there to me incense{H3828} from Sheba{H7614}, and the sweet{H2896} cane{H7070} from a far{H4801} country{H776}? your burnt offerings{H5930} are not acceptable{H7522}, nor your sacrifices{H2077} sweet{H6149}{(H8804)} unto me."
Jeremiah,6,21,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will lay{H5414}{(H8802)} stumblingblocks{H4383} before this people{H5971}, and the fathers{H1} and the sons{H1121} together{H3162} shall fall{H3782}{(H8804)} upon them; the neighbour{H7934} and his friend{H7453} shall perish{H6}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,6,22,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, a people{H5971} cometh{H935}{(H8802)} from the north{H6828} country{H776}, and a great{H1419} nation{H1471} shall be raised{H5782}{(H8735)} from the sides{H3411} of the earth{H776}."
Jeremiah,6,23,"They shall lay hold{H2388}{(H8686)} on bow{H7198} and spear{H3591}; they are cruel{H394}, and have no mercy{H7355}{(H8762)}; their voice{H6963} roareth{H1993}{(H8799)} like the sea{H3220}; and they ride{H7392}{(H8799)} upon horses{H5483}, set in array{H6186}{(H8803)} as men{H376} for war{H4421} against thee, O daughter{H1323} of Zion{H6726}."
Jeremiah,6,24,"We have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the fame{H8089} thereof: our hands{H3027} wax feeble{H7503}{(H8804)}: anguish{H6869} hath taken hold{H2388}{(H8689)} of us, and pain{H2427}, as of a woman in travail{H3205}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,6,25,"Go not forth{H3318}{(H8799)} into the field{H7704}, nor walk{H3212}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870}; for the sword{H2719} of the enemy{H341}{(H8802)} and fear{H4032} is on every side{H5439}."
Jeremiah,6,26,"O daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971}, gird{H2296}{(H8798)} thee with sackcloth{H8242}, and wallow{H6428}{(H8690)} thyself in ashes{H665}: make{H6213}{(H8798)} thee mourning{H60}, as for an only son{H3173}, most bitter{H8563} lamentation{H4553}: for the spoiler{H7703}{(H8802)} shall suddenly{H6597} come{H935}{(H8799)} upon us."
Jeremiah,6,27,"I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} thee for a tower{H969} and a fortress{H4013} among my people{H5971}, that thou mayest know{H3045}{(H8799)} and try{H974}{(H8804)} their way{H1870}."
Jeremiah,6,28,"They are all grievous{H5493}{(H8802)} revolters{H5637}{(H8802)}, walking{H1980}{(H8802)} with slanders{H7400}: they are brass{H5178} and iron{H1270}; they are all corrupters{H7843}{(H8688)}."
Jeremiah,6,29,"The bellows{H4647} are burned{H2787}{(H8738)}, the lead{H5777} is consumed{H8552}{(H8804)} of the fire{H800}{H784}; the founder{H6884}{(H8800)} melteth{H6884}{(H8804)} in vain{H7723}: for the wicked{H7451} are not plucked away{H5423}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,6,30,"Reprobate{H3988}{(H8737)} silver{H3701} shall men call{H7121}{(H8804)} them, because the LORD{H3068} hath rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} them."
Jeremiah,7,1,"The word{H1697} that came to Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,7,2,"Stand{H5975}{(H8798)} in the gate{H8179} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}, and proclaim{H7121}{(H8804)} there this word{H1697}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, all ye of Judah{H3063}, that enter in{H935}{(H8802)} at these gates{H8179} to worship{H7812}{(H8692)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,7,3,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Amend{H3190}{(H8685)} your ways{H1870} and your doings{H4611}, and I will cause you to dwell{H7931}{(H8762)} in this place{H4725}."
Jeremiah,7,4,"Trust{H982}{(H8799)} ye not in lying{H8267} words{H1697}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, The temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, The temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, are these."
Jeremiah,7,5,For if ye throughly{H3190}{(H8687)} amend{H3190}{(H8686)} your ways{H1870} and your doings{H4611}; if ye throughly{H6213}{(H8800)} execute{H6213}{(H8799)} judgment{H4941} between a man{H376} and his neighbour{H7453};
Jeremiah,7,6,"If ye oppress{H6231}{(H8799)} not the stranger{H1616}, the fatherless{H3490}, and the widow{H490}, and shed{H8210}{(H8799)} not innocent{H5355} blood{H1818} in this place{H4725}, neither walk{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430} to your hurt{H7451}:"
Jeremiah,7,7,"Then will I cause you to dwell{H7931}{(H8765)} in this place{H4725}, in the land{H776} that I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} to your fathers{H1}, for{H5704} ever{H5769} and ever{H5769}."
Jeremiah,7,8,"Behold, ye trust{H982}{(H8802)} in lying{H8267} words{H1697}, that cannot profit{H3276}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,7,9,"Will ye steal{H1589}{(H8800)}, murder{H7523}{(H8800)}, and commit adultery{H5003}{(H8800)}, and swear{H7650}{(H8736)} falsely{H8267}, and burn incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto Baal{H1168}, and walk{H1980}{(H8800)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430} whom ye know{H3045}{(H8804)} not;"
Jeremiah,7,10,"And come{H935}{(H8804)} and stand{H5975}{(H8804)} before{H6440} me in this house{H1004}, which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, We are delivered{H5337}{(H8738)} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} all these abominations{H8441}?"
Jeremiah,7,11,"Is this house{H1004}, which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}, become a den{H4631} of robbers{H6530} in your eyes{H5869}? Behold, even I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} it, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,7,12,"But go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye now unto my place{H4725} which was in Shiloh{H7887}, where I set{H7931}{(H8765)} my name{H8034} at the first{H7223}, and see{H7200}{(H8798)} what I did{H6213}{(H8804)} to it for{H6440} the wickedness{H7451} of my people{H5971} Israel{H3478}."
Jeremiah,7,13,"And now, because ye have done{H6213}{(H8800)} all these works{H4639}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and I spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto you, rising up early{H7925}{(H8687)} and speaking{H1696}{(H8763)}, but ye heard{H8085}{(H8804)} not; and I called{H7121}{(H8799)} you, but ye answered{H6030}{(H8804)} not;"
Jeremiah,7,14,"Therefore will I do{H6213}{(H8804)} unto this house{H1004}, which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}, wherein ye trust{H982}{(H8802)}, and unto the place{H4725} which I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} to you and to your fathers{H1}, as I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Shiloh{H7887}."
Jeremiah,7,15,"And I will cast you out{H7993}{(H8689)} of my sight{H6440}, as I have cast out{H7993}{(H8689)} all your brethren{H251}, even the whole seed{H2233} of Ephraim{H669}."
Jeremiah,7,16,"Therefore pray{H6419}{(H8691)} not thou for this people{H5971}, neither lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} cry{H7440} nor prayer{H8605} for them{H1157}, neither make intercession{H6293}{(H8799)} to me: for I will not hear{H8085}{(H8802)} thee."
Jeremiah,7,17,Seest{H7200}{(H8802)} thou not what they do{H6213}{(H8802)} in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} and in the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}?
Jeremiah,7,18,"The children{H1121} gather{H3950}{(H8764)} wood{H6086}, and the fathers{H1} kindle{H1197}{(H8764)} the fire{H784}, and the women{H802} knead{H3888}{(H8802)} their dough{H1217}, to make{H6213}{(H8800)} cakes{H3561} to the queen{H4446} of heaven{H8064}, and to pour out{H5258}{(H8687)} drink offerings{H5262} unto other{H312} gods{H430}, that they may provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,7,19,Do they provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8688)}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion{H1322} of their own faces{H6440}?
Jeremiah,7,20,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, mine anger{H639} and my fury{H2534} shall be poured out{H5413}{(H8737)} upon this place{H4725}, upon man{H120}, and upon beast{H929}, and upon the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704}, and upon the fruit{H6529} of the ground{H127}; and it shall burn{H1197}{(H8804)}, and shall not be quenched{H3518}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,7,21,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Put{H5595}{(H8798)} your burnt offerings{H5930} unto your sacrifices{H2077}, and eat{H398}{(H8798)} flesh{H1320}."
Jeremiah,7,22,"For I spake{H1696}{(H8765)} not unto your fathers{H1}, nor commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them in the day{H3117} that I brought them out{H3318}{(H8687)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, concerning{H1697} burnt offerings{H5930} or sacrifices{H2077}:"
Jeremiah,7,23,"But this thing{H1697} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} I them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Obey{H8085}{(H8798)} my voice{H6963}, and I will be your God{H430}, and ye shall be my people{H5971}: and walk{H1980}{(H8804)} ye in all the ways{H1870} that I have commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} you, that it may be well{H3190}{(H8799)} unto you."
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not, nor inclined{H5186}{(H8689)} their ear{H241}, but walked{H3212}{(H8799)} in the counsels{H4156} and in the imagination{H8307} of their evil{H7451} heart{H3820}, and went backward{H268}, and not forward{H6440}."
Jeremiah,7,25,"Since the day{H3117} that your fathers{H1} came forth out{H3318}{(H8804)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} unto this day{H3117} I have even sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto you all my servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, daily{H3117} rising up early{H7925}{(H8687)} and sending{H7971}{(H8800)} them:"
Jeremiah,7,26,"Yet they hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto me, nor inclined{H5186}{(H8689)} their ear{H241}, but hardened{H7185}{(H8686)} their neck{H6203}: they did worse{H7489}{(H8689)} than their fathers{H1}."
Jeremiah,7,27,Therefore thou shalt speak{H1696}{(H8765)} all these words{H1697} unto them; but they will not hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} to thee: thou shalt also call{H7121}{(H8804)} unto them; but they will not answer{H6030}{(H8799)} thee.
Jeremiah,7,28,"But thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, This is a nation{H1471} that obeyeth{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, nor receiveth{H3947}{(H8804)} correction{H4148}: truth{H530} is perished{H6}{(H8804)}, and is cut off{H3772}{(H8738)} from their mouth{H6310}."
Jeremiah,7,29,"Cut off{H1494}{(H8798)} thine hair{H5145}, O Jerusalem, and cast it away{H7993}{(H8685)}, and take up{H5375}{(H8798)} a lamentation{H7015} on high places{H8205}; for the LORD{H3068} hath rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} and forsaken{H5203}{(H8799)} the generation{H1755} of his wrath{H5678}."
Jeremiah,7,30,"For the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} have done{H6213}{(H8804)} evil{H7451} in my sight{H5869}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: they have set{H7760}{(H8804)} their abominations{H8251} in the house{H1004} which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}, to pollute{H2930}{(H8763)} it."
Jeremiah,7,31,"And they have built{H1129}{(H8804)} the high places{H1116} of Tophet{H8612}, which is in the valley{H1516} of the son{H1121} of Hinnom{H2011}, to burn{H8313}{(H8800)} their sons{H1121} and their daughters{H1323} in the fire{H784}; which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them not, neither came{H5927}{(H8804)} it into my heart{H3820}."
Jeremiah,7,32,"Therefore, behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that it shall no more be called{H559}{(H8735)} Tophet{H8612}, nor the valley{H1516} of the son{H1121} of Hinnom{H2011}, but the valley{H1516} of slaughter{H2028}: for they shall bury{H6912}{(H8804)} in Tophet{H8612}, till there be no{H369} place{H4725}."
Jeremiah,7,33,"And the carcases{H5038} of this people{H5971} shall be meat{H3978} for the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064}, and for the beasts{H929} of the earth{H776}; and none shall fray them away{H2729}{(H8688)}."
Jeremiah,7,34,"Then will I cause to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} from the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and from the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}, the voice{H6963} of mirth{H8342}, and the voice{H6963} of gladness{H8057}, the voice{H6963} of the bridegroom{H2860}, and the voice{H6963} of the bride{H3618}: for the land{H776} shall be desolate{H2723}."
Jeremiah,8,1,"At that time{H6256}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, they shall bring out{H3318}{(H8686)} the bones{H6106} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and the bones{H6106} of his princes{H8269}, and the bones{H6106} of the priests{H3548}, and the bones{H6106} of the prophets{H5030}, and the bones{H6106} of the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, out of their graves{H6913}:"
Jeremiah,8,2,"And they shall spread{H7849}{(H8804)} them before the sun{H8121}, and the moon{H3394}, and all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}, whom they have loved{H157}{(H8804)}, and whom they have served{H5647}{(H8804)}, and after{H310} whom they have walked{H1980}{(H8804)}, and whom they have sought{H1875}{(H8804)}, and whom they have worshipped{H7812}{(H8694)}: they shall not be gathered{H622}{(H8735)}, nor be buried{H6912}{(H8735)}; they shall be for dung{H1828} upon the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}."
Jeremiah,8,3,"And death{H4194} shall be chosen{H977}{(H8738)} rather than life{H2416} by all the residue{H7611} of them that remain{H7604}{(H8737)} of this evil{H7451} family{H4940}, which remain{H7604}{(H8737)} in all the places{H4725} whither I have driven{H5080}{(H8689)} them, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Jeremiah,8,4,"Moreover thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Shall they fall{H5307}{(H8799)}, and not arise{H6965}{(H8799)}? shall he turn away{H7725}{(H8799)}, and not return{H7725}{(H8799)}?"
Jeremiah,8,5,"Why then is this people{H5971} of Jerusalem{H3389} slidden back{H7725}{(H8790)} by a perpetual{H5329}{(H8737)} backsliding{H4878}? they hold{H2388}{(H8689)} fast deceit{H8649}, they refuse{H3985}{(H8765)} to return{H7725}{(H8800)}."
Jeremiah,8,6,"I hearkened{H7181}{(H8689)} and heard{H8085}{(H8799)}, but they spake not aright{H1696}{(H8762)}: no man{H376} repented{H5162}{(H8737)} him of{H5921} his wickedness{H7451}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What have I done{H6213}{(H8804)}? every one turned{H7725}{(H8804)} to his course{H4794}, as the horse{H5483} rusheth{H7857}{(H8802)} into the battle{H4421}."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Yea, the stork{H2624} in the heaven{H8064} knoweth{H3045}{(H8804)} her appointed times{H4150}; and the turtle{H8449} and the crane{H5483} and the swallow{H5693} observe{H8104}{(H8804)} the time{H6256} of their coming{H935}{(H8800)}; but my people{H5971} know{H3045}{(H8804)} not the judgment{H4941} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,8,8,"How do ye say{H559}{(H8799)}, We are wise{H2450}, and the law{H8451} of the LORD{H3068} is with us? Lo, certainly{H403} in vain{H8267} made{H6213}{(H8804)} he it; the pen{H5842} of the scribes{H5608}{(H8802)} is in vain{H8267}."
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise{H2450} men are ashamed{H3001}{(H8689)}, they are dismayed{H2865}{(H8804)} and taken{H3920}{(H8735)}: lo, they have rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}; and what wisdom{H2451} is in them?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} their wives{H802} unto others{H312}, and their fields{H7704} to them that shall inherit{H3423}{(H8802)} them: for every one from the least{H6996} even unto the greatest{H1419} is given{H1214}{(H8802)} to covetousness{H1215}, from the prophet{H5030} even unto the priest{H3548} every one dealeth{H6213}{(H8802)} falsely{H8267}."
Jeremiah,8,11,"For they have healed{H7495}{(H8762)} the hurt{H7667} of the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971} slightly{H7043}{(H8738)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Peace{H7965}, peace{H7965}; when there is no peace{H7965}."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Were they ashamed{H3001}{(H8689)} when they had committed{H6213}{(H8804)} abomination{H8441}? nay, they were not at all{H954}{(H8800)} ashamed{H954}{(H8799)}, neither could{H3045}{(H8804)} they blush{H3637}{(H8736)}: therefore shall they fall{H5307}{(H8799)} among them that fall{H5307}{(H8802)}: in the time{H6256} of their visitation{H6486} they shall be cast down{H3782}{(H8735)}, saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,8,13,"I will surely{H622}{(H8800)} consume{H5486}{(H8686)} them, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: there shall be no grapes{H6025} on the vine{H1612}, nor figs{H8384} on the fig tree{H8384}, and the leaf{H5929} shall fade{H5034}{(H8804)}; and the things that I have given{H5414}{(H8799)} them shall pass away{H5674}{(H8799)} from them."
Jeremiah,8,14,"Why do we sit still{H3427}{(H8802)}? assemble{H622}{(H8734)} yourselves, and let us enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the defenced{H4013} cities{H5892}, and let us be silent{H1826}{(H8735)} there: for the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} hath put us to silence{H1826}{(H8689)}, and given us water{H4325} of gall{H7219} to drink{H8248}{(H8686)}, because we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We looked{H6960}{(H8763)} for peace{H7965}, but no good{H2896} came; and for a time{H6256} of health{H4832}, and behold trouble{H1205}!"
Jeremiah,8,16,"The snorting{H5170} of his horses{H5483} was heard{H8085}{(H8738)} from Dan{H1835}: the whole land{H776} trembled{H7493}{(H8804)} at the sound{H6963} of the neighing{H4684} of his strong ones{H47}; for they are come{H935}{(H8799)}, and have devoured{H398}{(H8799)} the land{H776}, and all{H4393} that is in it; the city{H5892}, and those that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein."
Jeremiah,8,17,"For, behold, I will send{H7971}{(H8764)} serpents{H5175}, cockatrices{H6848}, among you, which will not be charmed{H3908}, and they shall bite{H5391}{(H8765)} you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,8,18,"When I would comfort{H4010} myself against sorrow{H3015}, my heart{H3820} is faint{H1742} in me."
Jeremiah,8,19,"Behold the voice{H6963} of the cry{H7775} of the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971} because of them that dwell in a far{H4801} country{H776}: Is not the LORD{H3068} in Zion{H6726}? is not her king{H4428} in her? Why have they provoked me to anger{H3707}{(H8689)} with their graven images{H6456}, and with strange{H5236} vanities{H1892}?"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The harvest{H7105} is past{H5674}{(H8804)}, the summer{H7019} is ended{H3615}{(H8804)}, and we are not saved{H3467}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,8,21,For the hurt{H7667} of the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971} am I hurt{H7665}{(H8717)}; I am black{H6937}{(H8804)}; astonishment{H8047} hath taken hold{H2388}{(H8689)} on me.
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm{H6875} in Gilead{H1568}; is there no physician{H7495}{(H8802)} there? why then{H3588} is not the health{H724} of the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971} recovered{H5927}{(H8804)}?
Jeremiah,9,1,"Oh that{H5414}{(H8799)} my head{H7218} were waters{H4325}, and mine eyes{H5869} a fountain{H4726} of tears{H1832}, that I might weep{H1058}{(H8799)} day{H3119} and night{H3915} for the slain{H2491} of the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971}!"
Jeremiah,9,2,"Oh that{H5414}{(H8799)} I had in the wilderness{H4057} a lodging place{H4411} of wayfaring men{H732}{(H8802)}; that I might leave{H5800}{(H8799)} my people{H5971}, and go{H3212}{(H8799)} from them! for they be all adulterers{H5003}{(H8764)}, an assembly{H6116} of treacherous men{H898}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,9,3,"And they bend{H1869}{(H8686)} their tongues{H3956} like their bow{H7198} for lies{H8267}: but they are not valiant{H1396}{(H8804)} for the truth{H530} upon the earth{H776}; for they proceed{H3318}{(H8804)} from evil{H7451} to evil{H7451}, and they know{H3045}{(H8804)} not me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,9,4,"Take ye heed{H8104}{(H8734)} every one{H376} of his neighbour{H7453}, and trust{H982}{(H8799)} ye not in any brother{H251}: for every brother{H251} will utterly{H6117}{(H8800)} supplant{H6117}{(H8799)}, and every neighbour{H7453} will walk{H1980}{(H8799)} with slanders{H7400}."
Jeremiah,9,5,"And they will deceive{H2048}{(H8762)} every one{H376} his neighbour{H7453}, and will not speak{H1696}{(H8762)} the truth{H571}: they have taught{H3925}{(H8765)} their tongue{H3956} to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} lies{H8267}, and weary{H3811}{(H8738)} themselves to commit iniquity{H5753}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,9,6,"Thine habitation{H3427}{(H8800)} is in the midst{H8432} of deceit{H4820}; through deceit{H4820} they refuse{H3985}{(H8765)} to know{H3045}{(H8800)} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,9,7,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, Behold, I will melt{H6884}{(H8802)} them, and try{H974}{(H8804)} them; for how shall I do{H6213}{(H8799)} for{H6440} the daughter{H1323} of my people{H5971}?"
Jeremiah,9,8,"Their tongue{H3956} is as an arrow{H2671} shot out{H7819}{(H8803)}; it speaketh{H1696}{(H8765)} deceit{H4820}: one speaketh{H1696}{(H8762)} peaceably{H7965} to his neighbour{H7453} with his mouth{H6310}, but in heart{H7130} he layeth{H7760}{(H8799)} his wait{H696}."
Jeremiah,9,9,Shall I not visit{H6485}{(H8799)} them for these things? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: shall not my soul{H5315} be avenged{H5358}{(H8691)} on such a nation{H1471} as this?
Jeremiah,9,10,"For the mountains{H2022} will I take up{H5375}{(H8799)} a weeping{H1065} and wailing{H5092}, and for the habitations{H4999} of the wilderness{H4057} a lamentation{H7015}, because they are burned up{H3341}{(H8738)}, so that none{H376} can pass{H5674}{(H8802)} through them; neither can men hear{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the cattle{H4735}; both the fowl{H5775} of the heavens{H8064} and the beast{H929} are fled{H5074}{(H8804)}; they are gone{H1980}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,9,11,"And I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} Jerusalem{H3389} heaps{H1530}, and a den{H4583} of dragons{H8577}; and I will make{H5414}{(H8799)} the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} desolate{H8077}, without an inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,9,12,"Who is the wise{H2450} man{H376}, that may understand{H995}{(H8799)} this? and who is he to whom the mouth{H6310} of the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}, that he may declare{H5046}{(H8686)} it, for what the land{H776} perisheth{H6}{(H8804)} and is burned up{H3341}{(H8738)} like a wilderness{H4057}, that none passeth through{H5674}{(H8802)}?"
Jeremiah,9,13,"And the LORD{H3068} saith{H559}{(H8799)}, Because they have forsaken{H5800}{(H8800)} my law{H8451} which I set{H5414}{(H8804)} before{H6440} them, and have not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} my voice{H6963}, neither walked{H1980}{(H8804)} therein;"
Jeremiah,9,14,"But have walked{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} the imagination{H8307} of their own heart{H3820}, and after{H310} Baalim{H1168}, which their fathers{H1} taught{H3925}{(H8765)} them:"
Jeremiah,9,15,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will feed{H398}{(H8688)} them, even this people{H5971}, with wormwood{H3939}, and give them water{H4325} of gall{H7219} to drink{H8248}{(H8689)}."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I will scatter{H6327}{(H8689)} them also among the heathen{H1471}, whom neither they nor their fathers{H1} have known{H3045}{(H8804)}: and I will send{H7971}{(H8765)} a sword{H2719} after{H310} them, till I have consumed{H3615}{(H8763)} them."
Jeremiah,9,17,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, Consider{H995}{(H8708)} ye, and call{H7121}{(H8798)} for the mourning women{H6969}{(H8789)}, that they may come{H935}{(H8799)}; and send{H7971}{(H8798)} for cunning{H2450} women, that they may come{H935}{(H8799)}:"
Jeremiah,9,18,"And let them make haste{H4116}{(H8762)}, and take up{H5375}{(H8799)} a wailing{H5092} for us, that our eyes{H5869} may run down{H3381}{(H8799)} with tears{H1832}, and our eyelids{H6079} gush out{H5140}{(H8799)} with waters{H4325}."
Jeremiah,9,19,"For a voice{H6963} of wailing{H5092} is heard{H8085}{(H8738)} out of Zion{H6726}, How are we spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}! we are greatly{H3966} confounded{H954}{(H8804)}, because we have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the land{H776}, because our dwellings{H4908} have cast us out{H7993}{(H8689)}."
Jeremiah,9,20,"Yet hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, O ye women{H802}, and let your ear{H241} receive{H3947}{(H8799)} the word{H1697} of his mouth{H6310}, and teach{H3925}{(H8761)} your daughters{H1323} wailing{H5092}, and every one{H802} her neighbour{H7468} lamentation{H7015}."
Jeremiah,9,21,"For death{H4194} is come up{H5927}{(H8804)} into our windows{H2474}, and is entered{H935}{(H8804)} into our palaces{H759}, to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} the children{H5768} from without{H2351}, and the young men{H970} from the streets{H7339}."
Jeremiah,9,22,"Speak{H1696}{(H8761)}, Thus saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, Even the carcases{H5038} of men{H120} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} as dung{H1828} upon the open{H6440} field{H7704}, and as the handful{H5995} after{H310} the harvestman{H7114}{(H8802)}, and none shall gather{H622}{(H8764)} them."
Jeremiah,9,23,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Let not the wise{H2450} man glory{H1984}{(H8691)} in his wisdom{H2451}, neither let the mighty{H1368} man glory{H1984}{(H8691)} in his might{H1369}, let not the rich{H6223} man glory{H1984}{(H8691)} in his riches{H6239}:"
Jeremiah,9,24,"But let him that glorieth{H1984}{(H8693)} glory{H1984}{(H8691)} in this, that he understandeth{H7919}{(H8687)} and knoweth{H3045}{(H8800)} me, that I am the LORD{H3068} which exercise{H6213}{(H8802)} lovingkindness{H2617}, judgment{H4941}, and righteousness{H6666}, in the earth{H776}: for in these things I delight{H2654}{(H8804)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,9,25,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} all them which are circumcised{H4135}{(H8803)} with the uncircumcised{H6190};"
Jeremiah,9,26,"Egypt{H4714}, and Judah{H3063}, and Edom{H123}, and the children{H1121} of Ammon{H5983}, and Moab{H4124}, and all that are in the utmost{H7112}{(H8803)} corners{H6285}, that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the wilderness{H4057}: for all these nations{H1471} are uncircumcised{H6189}, and all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} are uncircumcised{H6189} in the heart{H3820}."
Jeremiah,10,1,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the word{H1697} which the LORD{H3068} speaketh{H1696}{(H8765)} unto you, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}:"
Jeremiah,10,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Learn{H3925}{(H8799)} not the way{H1870} of the heathen{H1471}, and be not dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)} at the signs{H226} of heaven{H8064}; for the heathen{H1471} are dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)} at them{H1992}."
Jeremiah,10,3,"For the customs{H2708} of the people{H5971} are vain{H1892}: for one cutteth{H3772}{(H8804)} a tree{H6086} out of the forest{H3293}, the work{H4639} of the hands{H3027} of the workman{H2796}, with the axe{H4621}."
Jeremiah,10,4,"They deck{H3302}{(H8762)} it with silver{H3701} and with gold{H2091}; they fasten{H2388}{(H8762)} it with nails{H4548} and with hammers{H4717}, that it move{H6328}{(H8686)} not."
Jeremiah,10,5,"They are upright{H4749} as the palm tree{H8560}, but speak{H1696}{(H8762)} not: they must needs{H5375}{(H8800)} be borne{H5375}{(H8735)}, because they cannot go{H6805}{(H8799)}. Be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of them; for they cannot do evil{H7489}{(H8686)}, neither also is it in them to do good{H3190}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,10,6,"Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD{H3068}; thou art great{H1419}, and thy name{H8034} is great{H1419} in might{H1369}."
Jeremiah,10,7,"Who would not fear{H3372}{(H8799)} thee, O King{H4428} of nations{H1471}? for to thee doth it appertain{H2969}{(H8804)}: forasmuch as among all the wise{H2450} men of the nations{H1471}, and in all their kingdoms{H4438}, there is none like unto thee."
Jeremiah,10,8,But they are altogether{H259} brutish{H1197}{(H8799)} and foolish{H3688}{(H8799)}: the stock{H6086} is a doctrine{H4148} of vanities{H1892}.
Jeremiah,10,9,"Silver{H3701} spread into plates{H7554}{(H8794)} is brought{H935}{(H8714)} from Tarshish{H8659}, and gold{H2091} from Uphaz{H210}, the work{H4639} of the workman{H2796}, and of the hands{H3027} of the founder{H6884}{(H8802)}: blue{H8504} and purple{H713} is their clothing{H3830}: they are all the work{H4639} of cunning{H2450} men."
Jeremiah,10,10,"But the LORD{H3068} is the true{H571} God{H430}, he is the living{H2416} God{H430}, and an everlasting{H5769} king{H4428}: at his wrath{H7110} the earth{H776} shall tremble{H7493}{(H8799)}, and the nations{H1471} shall not be able to abide{H3557}{(H8686)} his indignation{H2195}."
Jeremiah,10,11,"Thus{H1836} shall ye say{H560}{(H8748)} unto them, The gods{H426} that have not{H3809} made{H5648}{(H8754)} the heavens{H8065} and the earth{H778}, even they shall perish{H7}{(H8748)} from the earth{H772}, and from under{H8460} these{H429} heavens{H8065}."
Jeremiah,10,12,"He hath made{H6213}{(H8802)} the earth{H776} by his power{H3581}, he hath established{H3559}{(H8688)} the world{H8398} by his wisdom{H2451}, and hath stretched out{H5186}{(H8804)} the heavens{H8064} by his discretion{H8394}."
Jeremiah,10,13,"When he uttereth{H5414}{(H8800)} his voice{H6963}, there is a multitude{H1995} of waters{H4325} in the heavens{H8064}, and he causeth the vapours{H5387} to ascend{H5927}{(H8686)} from the ends{H7097} of the earth{H776}; he maketh{H6213}{(H8804)} lightnings{H1300} with rain{H4306}, and bringeth forth{H3318}{(H8686)} the wind{H7307} out of his treasures{H214}."
Jeremiah,10,14,"Every man{H120} is brutish{H1197}{(H8738)} in his knowledge{H1847}: every founder{H6884}{(H8802)} is confounded{H3001}{(H8689)} by the graven image{H6459}: for his molten image{H5262} is falsehood{H8267}, and there is no breath{H7307} in them."
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are vanity{H1892}, and the work{H4639} of errors{H8595}: in the time{H6256} of their visitation{H6486} they shall perish{H6}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,10,16,The portion{H2506} of Jacob{H3290} is not like them: for he is the former{H3335}{(H8802)} of all things; and Israel{H3478} is the rod{H7626} of his inheritance{H5159}: The LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} is his name{H8034}.
Jeremiah,10,17,"Gather up{H622}{(H8798)} thy wares{H3666} out of the land{H776}, O inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of the fortress{H4692}."
Jeremiah,10,18,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will sling{H7049}{(H8802)} out the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of the land{H776} at this once{H6471}, and will distress{H6887}{(H8689)} them, that they may find{H4672}{(H8799)} it so."
Jeremiah,10,19,"Woe{H188} is me for my hurt{H7667}! my wound{H4347} is grievous{H2470}{(H8737)}: but I said{H559}{(H8804)}, Truly{H389} this is a grief{H2483}, and I must bear{H5375}{(H8799)} it."
Jeremiah,10,20,"My tabernacle{H168} is spoiled{H7703}{(H8795)}, and all my cords{H4340} are broken{H5423}{(H8738)}: my children{H1121} are gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)} of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth{H5186}{(H8802)} my tent{H168} any more, and to set up{H6965}{(H8688)} my curtains{H3407}."
Jeremiah,10,21,"For the pastors{H7462}{(H8802)} are become brutish{H1197}{(H8738)}, and have not sought{H1875}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}: therefore they shall not prosper{H7919}{(H8689)}, and all their flocks{H4830} shall be scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,10,22,"Behold, the noise{H6963} of the bruit{H8052} is come{H935}{(H8802)}, and a great{H1419} commotion{H7494} out of the north{H6828} country{H776}, to make{H7760}{(H8800)} the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} desolate{H8077}, and a den{H4583} of dragons{H8577}."
Jeremiah,10,23,"O LORD{H3068}, I know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the way{H1870} of man{H120} is not in himself: it is not in man{H376} that walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} to direct{H3559}{(H8687)} his steps{H6806}."
Jeremiah,10,24,"O LORD{H3068}, correct{H3256}{(H8761)} me, but with judgment{H4941}; not in thine anger{H639}, lest thou bring me to nothing{H4591}{(H8686)}."
Jeremiah,10,25,"Pour out{H8210}{(H8798)} thy fury{H2534} upon the heathen{H1471} that know{H3045}{(H8804)} thee not, and upon the families{H4940} that call{H7121}{(H8804)} not on thy name{H8034}: for they have eaten up{H398}{(H8804)} Jacob{H3290}, and devoured{H398}{(H8804)} him, and consumed{H3615}{(H8762)} him, and have made his habitation{H5116} desolate{H8074}{(H8689)}."
Jeremiah,11,1,"The word{H1697} that came to Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,11,2,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the words{H1697} of this covenant{H1285}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} unto the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, and to the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389};"
Jeremiah,11,3,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} thou unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be the man{H376} that obeyeth{H8085}{(H8799)} not the words{H1697} of this covenant{H1285},"
Jeremiah,11,4,"Which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} your fathers{H1} in the day{H3117} that I brought them forth{H3318}{(H8687)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, from the iron{H1270} furnace{H3564}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Obey{H8085}{(H8798)} my voice{H6963}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} them, according to all which I command{H6680}{(H8762)} you: so shall ye be my people{H5971}, and I will be your God{H430}:"
Jeremiah,11,5,"That I may perform{H6965}{(H8687)} the oath{H7621} which I have sworn{H7650}{(H8738)} unto your fathers{H1}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} them a land{H776} flowing{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}, as it is this day{H3117}. Then answered{H6030}{(H8799)} I, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, So be it{H543}, O LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,11,6,"Then the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Proclaim{H7121}{(H8798)} all these words{H1697} in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and in the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the words{H1697} of this covenant{H1285}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I earnestly{H5749}{(H8687)} protested{H5749}{(H8689)} unto your fathers{H1} in the day{H3117} that I brought them up{H5927}{(H8687)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, even unto this day{H3117}, rising early{H7925}{(H8687)} and protesting{H5749}{(H8687)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Obey{H8085}{(H8798)} my voice{H6963}."
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not, nor inclined{H5186}{(H8689)} their ear{H241}, but walked{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} in the imagination{H8307} of their evil{H7451} heart{H3820}: therefore I will bring{H935}{(H8686)} upon them all the words{H1697} of this covenant{H1285}, which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them to do{H6213}{(H8800)}; but they did{H6213}{(H8804)} them not."
Jeremiah,11,9,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, A conspiracy{H7195} is found{H4672}{(H8738)} among the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, and among the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They are turned back{H7725}{(H8804)} to the iniquities{H5771} of their forefathers{H7223}{H1}, which refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to hear{H8085}{(H8800)} my words{H1697}; and they went{H1980}{(H8804)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430} to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} them: the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} have broken{H6565}{(H8689)} my covenant{H1285} which I made{H3772}{(H8804)} with their fathers{H1}."
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} evil{H7451} upon them, which they shall not be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to escape{H3318}{(H8800)}; and though they shall cry{H2199}{(H8804)} unto me, I will not hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"Then shall the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} and inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} go{H1980}{(H8804)}, and cry{H2199}{(H8804)} unto the gods{H430} unto whom they offer incense{H6999}{(H8764)}: but they shall not save{H3467}{(H8686)} them at all{H3467}{(H8687)} in the time{H6256} of their trouble{H7451}."
Jeremiah,11,13,"For according to the number{H4557} of thy cities{H5892} were thy gods{H430}, O Judah{H3063}; and according to the number{H4557} of the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389} have ye set up{H7760}{(H8804)} altars{H4196} to that shameful thing{H1322}, even altars{H4196} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto Baal{H1168}."
Jeremiah,11,14,"Therefore pray{H6419}{(H8691)} not thou for this people{H5971}, neither lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} a cry{H7440} or prayer{H8605} for them: for I will not hear{H8085}{(H8802)} them in the time{H6256} that they cry{H7121}{(H8800)} unto me for their trouble{H7451}."
Jeremiah,11,15,"What hath my beloved{H3039} to do in mine house{H1004}, seeing she hath wrought{H6213}{(H8800)} lewdness{H4209} with many{H7227}, and the holy{H6944} flesh{H1320} is passed{H5674}{(H8799)} from thee? when thou doest evil{H7451}, then thou rejoicest{H5937}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,11,16,"The LORD{H3068} called{H7121}{(H8804)} thy name{H8034}, A green{H7488} olive tree{H2132}, fair{H3303}, and of goodly{H8389} fruit{H6529}: with the noise{H6963} of a great{H1419} tumult{H1999} he hath kindled{H3341}{(H8689)} fire{H784} upon it, and the branches{H1808} of it are broken{H7489}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,11,17,"For the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, that planted{H5193}{(H8802)} thee, hath pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} evil{H7451} against thee, for{H1558} the evil{H7451} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and of the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, which they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} against themselves to provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)} in offering incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto Baal{H1168}."
Jeremiah,11,18,"And the LORD{H3068} hath given me knowledge{H3045}{(H8799)} of it, and I know{H3045}{(H8689)} it: then thou shewedst{H7200}{(H8689)} me their doings{H4611}."
Jeremiah,11,19,"But I was like a lamb{H3532} or an ox{H441} that is brought{H2986}{(H8714)} to the slaughter{H2873}{(H8800)}; and I knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not that they had devised{H2803}{(H8804)} devices{H4284} against me, saying, Let us destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} the tree{H6086} with the fruit{H3899} thereof, and let us cut him off{H3772}{(H8799)} from the land{H776} of the living{H2416}, that his name{H8034} may be no more remembered{H2142}{(H8735)}."
Jeremiah,11,20,"But, O LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, that judgest{H8199}{(H8802)} righteously{H6664}, that triest{H974}{(H8802)} the reins{H3629} and the heart{H3820}, let me see{H7200}{(H8799)} thy vengeance{H5360} on them: for unto thee have I revealed{H1540}{(H8765)} my cause{H7379}."
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of the men{H582} of Anathoth{H6068}, that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} thy life{H5315}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Prophesy{H5012}{(H8735)} not in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}, that thou die{H4191}{(H8799)} not by our hand{H3027}:"
Jeremiah,11,22,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, Behold, I will punish{H6485}{(H8802)} them: the young men{H970} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}; their sons{H1121} and their daughters{H1323} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by famine{H7458}:"
Jeremiah,11,23,"And there shall be no remnant{H7611} of them: for I will bring{H935}{(H8686)} evil{H7451} upon the men{H582} of Anathoth{H6068}, even the year{H8141} of their visitation{H6486}."
Jeremiah,12,1,"Righteous{H6662} art thou, O LORD{H3068}, when I plead{H7378}{(H8799)} with thee: yet let me talk{H1696}{(H8762)} with thee of thy judgments{H4941}: Wherefore doth the way{H1870} of the wicked{H7563} prosper{H6743}{(H8804)}? wherefore are all they happy{H7951}{(H8804)} that deal very{H899} treacherously{H898}{(H8802)}?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"Thou hast planted{H5193}{(H8804)} them, yea, they have taken root{H8327}{(H8776)}: they grow{H3212}{(H8799)}, yea, they bring forth{H6213}{(H8804)} fruit{H6529}: thou art near{H7138} in their mouth{H6310}, and far from{H7350} their reins{H3629}."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But thou, O LORD{H3068}, knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} me: thou hast seen{H7200}{(H8799)} me, and tried{H974}{(H8804)} mine heart{H3820} toward thee: pull them out{H5423}{(H8685)} like sheep{H6629} for the slaughter{H2878}, and prepare{H6942}{(H8685)} them for the day{H3117} of slaughter{H2028}."
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long shall the land{H776} mourn{H56}{(H8799)}, and the herbs{H6212} of every field{H7704} wither{H3001}{(H8799)}, for the wickedness{H7451} of them that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein? the beasts{H929} are consumed{H5595}{(H8804)}, and the birds{H5775}; because they said{H559}{(H8804)}, He shall not see{H7200}{(H8799)} our last end{H319}."
Jeremiah,12,5,"If thou hast run{H7323}{(H8804)} with the footmen{H7273}, and they have wearied{H3811}{(H8686)} thee, then how canst thou contend{H8474}{(H8807)} with horses{H5483}? and if in the land{H776} of peace{H7965}, wherein thou trustedst{H982}{(H8802)}, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do{H6213}{(H8799)} in the swelling{H1347} of Jordan{H3383}?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"For even thy brethren{H251}, and the house{H1004} of thy father{H1}, even they have dealt treacherously{H898}{(H8804)} with thee; yea, they have called{H7121}{(H8804)} a multitude{H4392} after{H310} thee: believe{H539}{(H8686)} them not, though they speak{H1696}{(H8762)} fair words{H2896} unto thee."
Jeremiah,12,7,"I have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} mine house{H1004}, I have left{H5203}{(H8804)} mine heritage{H5159}; I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} the dearly beloved{H3033} of my soul{H5315} into the hand{H3709} of her enemies{H341}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,12,8,Mine heritage{H5159} is unto me as a lion{H738} in the forest{H3293}; it crieth out{H5414}{(H8804)}{H6963} against me: therefore have I hated{H8130}{(H8804)} it.
Jeremiah,12,9,"Mine heritage{H5159} is unto me as a speckled{H6641} bird{H5861}, the birds{H5861} round about{H5439} are against her; come{H3212}{(H8798)} ye, assemble{H622}{(H8798)} all the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704}, come{H857}{(H8685)} to devour{H402}."
Jeremiah,12,10,"Many{H7227} pastors{H7462}{(H8802)} have destroyed{H7843}{(H8765)} my vineyard{H3754}, they have trodden{H947} my portion{H2513} under foot{H947}{(H8790)}, they have made{H5414}{(H8804)} my pleasant{H2532} portion{H2513} a desolate{H8077} wilderness{H4057}."
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have made{H7760}{(H8804)} it desolate{H8076}, and being desolate{H8077} it mourneth{H56}{(H8804)} unto me; the whole land{H776} is made desolate{H8074}{(H8738)}, because no man{H376} layeth{H7760}{(H8802)} it to heart{H3820}."
Jeremiah,12,12,The spoilers{H7703}{(H8802)} are come{H935}{(H8804)} upon all high places{H8205} through the wilderness{H4057}: for the sword{H2719} of the LORD{H3068} shall devour{H398}{(H8802)} from the one end{H7097} of the land{H776} even to the other end{H7097} of the land{H776}: no flesh{H1320} shall have peace{H7965}.
Jeremiah,12,13,"They have sown{H2232}{(H8804)} wheat{H2406}, but shall reap{H7114}{(H8804)} thorns{H6975}: they have put themselves to pain{H2470}{(H8738)}, but shall not profit{H3276}{(H8686)}: and they shall be ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} of your revenues{H8393} because of the fierce{H2740} anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,12,14,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} against all mine evil{H7451} neighbours{H7934}, that touch{H5060}{(H8802)} the inheritance{H5159} which I have caused my people{H5971} Israel{H3478} to inherit{H5157}{(H8689)}; Behold, I will pluck them out{H5428}{(H8802)} of their land{H127}, and pluck out{H5428}{(H8799)} the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} from among{H8432} them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"And it shall come to pass, after{H310} that I have plucked them out{H5428}{(H8800)} I will return{H7725}{(H8799)}, and have compassion{H7355}{(H8765)} on them, and will bring them again{H7725}{(H8689)}, every man{H376} to his heritage{H5159}, and every man{H376} to his land{H776}."
Jeremiah,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently{H3925}{(H8800)} learn{H3925}{(H8799)} the ways{H1870} of my people{H5971}, to swear{H7650}{(H8736)} by my name{H8034}, The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}; as they taught{H3925}{(H8765)} my people{H5971} to swear{H7650}{(H8736)} by Baal{H1168}; then shall they be built{H1129}{(H8738)} in the midst{H8432} of my people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if they will not obey{H8085}{(H8799)}, I will utterly{H5428}{(H8800)} pluck up{H5428}{(H8804)} and destroy{H6}{(H8763)} that nation{H1471}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,13,1,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} unto me, Go{H1980}{(H8800)} and get{H7069}{(H8804)} thee a linen{H6593} girdle{H232}, and put{H7760}{(H8804)} it upon thy loins{H4975}, and put{H935}{(H8686)} it not in water{H4325}."
Jeremiah,13,2,"So I got{H7069}{(H8799)} a girdle{H232} according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and put{H7760}{(H8799)} it on my loins{H4975}."
Jeremiah,13,3,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me the second time{H8145}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,13,4,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} the girdle{H232} that thou hast got{H7069}{(H8804)}, which is upon thy loins{H4975}, and arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go{H3212}{(H8798)} to Euphrates{H6578}, and hide{H2934}{(H8798)} it there in a hole{H5357} of the rock{H5553}."
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went{H3212}{(H8799)}, and hid{H2934}{(H8799)} it by Euphrates{H6578}, as the LORD{H3068} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"And it came to pass after{H7093} many{H7227} days{H3117}, that the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go{H3212}{(H8798)} to Euphrates{H6578}, and take{H3947}{(H8798)} the girdle{H232} from thence, which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} thee to hide{H2934}{(H8800)} there."
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went{H3212}{(H8799)} to Euphrates{H6578}, and digged{H2658}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the girdle{H232} from the place{H4725} where I had hid{H2934}{(H8804)} it: and, behold, the girdle{H232} was marred{H7843}{(H8738)}, it was profitable{H6743}{(H8799)} for nothing."
Jeremiah,13,8,"Then the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,13,9,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, After this manner will I mar{H7843}{(H8686)} the pride{H1347} of Judah{H3063}, and the great{H7227} pride{H1347} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,13,10,"This evil{H7451} people{H5971}, which refuse{H3987} to hear{H8085}{(H8800)} my words{H1697}, which walk{H1980}{(H8802)} in the imagination{H8307} of their heart{H3820}, and walk{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430}, to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} them, and to worship{H7812}{(H8692)} them, shall even be as this girdle{H232}, which is good{H6743}{(H8799)} for nothing."
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as the girdle{H232} cleaveth{H1692}{(H8799)} to the loins{H4975} of a man{H376}, so have I caused to cleave{H1692}{(H8689)} unto me the whole house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and the whole house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; that they might be unto me for a people{H5971}, and for a name{H8034}, and for a praise{H8416}, and for a glory{H8597}: but they would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,13,12,"Therefore thou shalt speak{H559}{(H8804)} unto them this word{H1697}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, Every bottle{H5035} shall be filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with wine{H3196}: and they shall say{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, Do we not certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} know{H3045}{(H8799)} that every bottle{H5035} shall be filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with wine{H3196}?"
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then shalt thou say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will fill{H4390}{(H8764)} all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of this land{H776}, even the kings{H4428} that sit{H3427}{(H8802)} upon David's{H1732} throne{H3678}, and the priests{H3548}, and the prophets{H5030}, and all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, with drunkenness{H7943}."

Jeremiah,13,15,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye, and give ear{H238}{(H8685)}; be not proud{H1361}{(H8799)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give{H5414}{(H8798)} glory{H3519} to the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, before he cause darkness{H2821}{(H8686)}, and before your feet{H7272} stumble{H5062}{(H8691)} upon the dark{H5399} mountains{H2022}, and, while ye look{H6960}{(H8765)} for light{H216}, he turn{H7760}{(H8804)} it into the shadow of death{H6757}, and make{H7896}{(H8798)}{(H8675)}{H7896}{(H8799)} it gross darkness{H6205}."
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if ye will not hear{H8085}{(H8799)} it, my soul{H5315} shall weep{H1058}{(H8799)} in secret places{H4565} for{H6440} your pride{H1466}; and mine eye{H5869} shall weep{H1830}{(H8799)} sore{H1830}{(H8800)}, and run down{H3381}{(H8799)} with tears{H1832}, because the LORD'S{H3068} flock{H5739} is carried away captive{H7617}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} unto the king{H4428} and to the queen{H1377}, Humble{H8213}{(H8685)} yourselves, sit down{H3427}{(H8798)}: for your principalities{H4761} shall come down{H3381}{(H8804)}, even the crown{H5850} of your glory{H8597}."
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities{H5892} of the south{H5045} shall be shut up{H5462}{(H8795)}, and none shall open{H6605}{(H8802)} them: Judah{H3063} shall be carried away captive{H1540}{(H8717)} all of it, it shall be wholly{H7965} carried away captive{H1540}{(H8717)}."
Jeremiah,13,20,"Lift up{H5375}{(H8798)} your eyes{H5869}, and behold{H7200}{(H8798)} them that come{H935}{(H8802)} from the north{H6828}: where is the flock{H5739} that was given{H5414}{(H8738)} thee, thy beautiful{H8597} flock{H6629}?"
Jeremiah,13,21,"What wilt thou say{H559}{(H8799)} when he shall punish{H6485}{(H8799)} thee? for thou hast taught{H3925}{(H8765)} them to be captains{H441}, and as chief{H7218} over thee: shall not sorrows{H2256} take{H270}{(H8799)} thee, as a woman{H802} in travail{H3205}{(H8800)}?"
Jeremiah,13,22,"And if thou say{H559}{(H8799)} in thine heart{H3824}, Wherefore come{H7122}{(H8804)} these things upon me? For the greatness{H7230} of thine iniquity{H5771} are thy skirts{H7757} discovered{H1540}{(H8738)}, and thy heels{H6119} made bare{H2554}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,13,23,"Can the Ethiopian{H3569} change{H2015}{(H8799)} his skin{H5785}, or the leopard{H5246} his spots{H2272}? then may{H3201}{(H8799)} ye also do good{H3190}{(H8687)}, that are accustomed{H3928} to do evil{H7489}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,13,24,Therefore will I scatter{H6327}{(H8686)} them as the stubble{H7179} that passeth away{H5674}{(H8802)} by the wind{H7307} of the wilderness{H4057}.
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is thy lot{H1486}, the portion{H4490} of thy measures{H4055} from me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; because thou hast forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} me, and trusted{H982}{(H8799)} in falsehood{H8267}."
Jeremiah,13,26,"Therefore will I discover{H2834}{(H8804)} thy skirts{H7757} upon thy face{H6440}, that thy shame{H7036} may appear{H7200}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,13,27,"I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} thine adulteries{H5004}, and thy neighings{H4684}, the lewdness{H2154} of thy whoredom{H2184}, and thine abominations{H8251} on the hills{H1389} in the fields{H7704}. Woe{H188} unto thee, O Jerusalem{H3389}! wilt thou not be made clean{H2891}{(H8799)}? when shall it once{H5750}{H310} be?"

Jeremiah,14,2,"Judah{H3063} mourneth{H56}{(H8804)}, and the gates{H8179} thereof languish{H535}{(H8797)}; they are black{H6937}{(H8804)} unto the ground{H776}; and the cry{H6682} of Jerusalem{H3389} is gone up{H5927}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,14,3,"And their nobles{H117} have sent{H7971}{(H8804)} their little ones{H6810} to the waters{H4325}: they came{H935}{(H8804)} to the pits{H1356}{(H8676)}{H1360}, and found{H4672}{(H8804)} no water{H4325}; they returned{H7725}{(H8804)} with their vessels{H3627} empty{H7387}; they were ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} and confounded{H3637}{(H8717)}, and covered{H2645}{(H8804)} their heads{H7218}."
Jeremiah,14,4,"Because the ground{H127} is chapt{H2865}{(H8804)}, for there was no rain{H1653} in the earth{H776}, the plowmen{H406} were ashamed{H954}{(H8804)}, they covered{H2645}{(H8804)} their heads{H7218}."
Jeremiah,14,5,"Yea, the hind{H365} also calved{H3205}{(H8804)} in the field{H7704}, and forsook{H5800}{(H8800)} it, because there was no grass{H1877}."
Jeremiah,14,6,"And the wild asses{H6501} did stand{H5975}{(H8804)} in the high places{H8205}, they snuffed up{H7602}{(H8804)} the wind{H7307} like dragons{H8577}; their eyes{H5869} did fail{H3615}{(H8804)}, because there was no grass{H6212}."
Jeremiah,14,7,"O LORD{H3068}, though our iniquities{H5771} testify{H6030}{(H8804)} against us, do{H6213}{(H8798)} thou it for thy name's{H8034} sake: for our backslidings{H4878} are many{H7231}{(H8804)}; we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee."
Jeremiah,14,8,"O the hope{H4723} of Israel{H3478}, the saviour{H3467}{(H8688)} thereof in time{H6256} of trouble{H6869}, why shouldest thou be as a stranger{H1616} in the land{H776}, and as a wayfaring man{H732}{(H8802)} that turneth aside{H5186}{(H8804)} to tarry for a night{H3885}{(H8800)}?"

Jeremiah,14,19,"Hast thou utterly{H3988}{(H8800)} rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} Judah{H3063}? hath thy soul{H5315} lothed{H1602}{(H8804)} Zion{H6726}? why hast thou smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} us, and there is no healing{H4832} for us? we looked{H6960}{(H8763)} for peace{H7965}, and there is no good{H2896}; and for the time{H6256} of healing{H4832}, and behold trouble{H1205}!"
Jeremiah,14,20,"We acknowledge{H3045}{(H8804)}, O LORD{H3068}, our wickedness{H7562}, and the iniquity{H5771} of our fathers{H1}: for we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee."
Jeremiah,14,21,"Do not abhor{H5006}{(H8799)} us, for thy name's{H8034} sake, do not disgrace{H5034}{(H8762)} the throne{H3678} of thy glory{H3519}: remember{H2142}{(H8798)}, break{H6565}{(H8686)} not thy covenant{H1285} with us."
Jeremiah,14,22,"Are there{H3426} any among the vanities{H1892} of the Gentiles{H1471} that can cause rain{H1652}{(H8688)}? or can the heavens{H8064} give{H5414}{(H8799)} showers{H7241}? art not thou he, O LORD{H3068} our God{H430}? therefore we will wait{H6960}{(H8762)} upon thee: for thou hast made{H6213}{(H8804)} all these things."
Jeremiah,15,1,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} unto me, Though Moses{H4872} and Samuel{H8050} stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me, yet my mind{H5315} could not be toward this people{H5971}: cast them out{H7971}{(H8761)} of my sight{H6440}, and let them go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,15,2,"And it shall come to pass, if they say{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee, Whither shall we go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}? then thou shalt tell{H559}{(H8804)} them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Such as are for death{H4194}, to death{H4194}; and such as are for the sword{H2719}, to the sword{H2719}; and such as are for the famine{H7458}, to the famine{H7458}; and such as are for the captivity{H7628}, to the captivity{H7628}."

Jeremiah,15,5,"For who shall have pity{H2550}{(H8799)} upon thee, O Jerusalem{H3389}? or who shall bemoan{H5110}{(H8799)} thee? or who shall go aside{H5493}{(H8799)} to ask{H7592}{(H8800)} how thou doest{H7965}?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"Thou hast forsaken{H5203}{(H8804)} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, thou art gone{H3212}{(H8799)} backward{H268}: therefore will I stretch out{H5186}{(H8686)} my hand{H3027} against thee, and destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} thee; I am weary{H3811}{(H8738)} with repenting{H5162}{(H8736)}."
Jeremiah,15,7,"And I will fan{H2219}{(H8799)} them with a fan{H4214} in the gates{H8179} of the land{H776}; I will bereave{H7921}{(H8765)} them of children, I will destroy{H6}{(H8765)} my people{H5971}, since they return{H7725}{(H8804)} not from their ways{H1870}."
Jeremiah,15,8,"Their widows{H490} are increased{H6105}{(H8804)} to me above the sand{H2344} of the seas{H3220}: I have brought{H935}{(H8689)} upon them against the mother{H517} of the young men{H970} a spoiler{H7703}{(H8802)} at noonday{H6672}: I have caused him to fall{H5307}{(H8689)} upon it suddenly{H6597}, and terrors{H928} upon the city{H5892}."
Jeremiah,15,9,"She that hath borne{H3205}{(H8802)} seven{H7651} languisheth{H535}{(H8797)}: she hath given up{H5301}{(H8804)} the ghost{H5315}; her sun{H8121} is gone{H935}{(H8804)} down while it was yet day{H3119}{(H8676)}{H3117}: she hath been ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} and confounded{H2659}{(H8804)}: and the residue{H7611} of them will I deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} to the sword{H2719} before{H6440} their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."

Jeremiah,15,16,"Thy words{H1697} were found{H4672}{(H8738)}, and I did eat{H398}{(H8799)} them; and thy word{H1697} was unto me the joy{H8342} and rejoicing{H8057} of mine heart{H3824}: for I am called{H7121}{(H8738)} by thy name{H8034}, O LORD{H3068} God{H430} of hosts{H6635}."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I sat{H3427}{(H8804)} not in the assembly{H5475} of the mockers{H7832}{(H8764)}, nor rejoiced{H5937}{(H8799)}; I sat{H3427}{(H8804)} alone{H910} because{H6440} of thy hand{H3027}: for thou hast filled{H4390}{(H8765)} me with indignation{H2195}."
Jeremiah,15,18,"Why is my pain{H3511} perpetual{H5331}, and my wound{H4347} incurable{H605}{(H8803)}, which refuseth{H3985}{(H8765)} to be healed{H7495}{(H8736)}? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar{H391}, and as waters{H4325} that fail{H539}{(H8738)}?"
Jeremiah,15,19,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, If thou return{H7725}{(H8799)}, then will I bring thee again{H7725}{(H8686)}, and thou shalt stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me: and if thou take forth{H3318}{(H8686)} the precious{H3368} from the vile{H2151}{(H8802)}, thou shalt be as my mouth{H6310}: let them return{H7725}{(H8799)} unto thee; but return{H7725}{(H8799)} not thou unto them."

Jeremiah,15,21,"And I will deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} thee out of the hand{H3027} of the wicked{H7451}, and I will redeem{H6299}{(H8804)} thee out of the hand{H3709} of the terrible{H6184}."

Jeremiah,16,4,"They shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} of grievous{H8463} deaths{H4463}; they shall not be lamented{H5594}{(H8735)}; neither shall they be buried{H6912}{(H8735)}; but they shall be as dung{H1828} upon the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}: and they shall be consumed{H3615}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, and by famine{H7458}; and their carcases{H5038} shall be meat{H3978} for the fowls{H5775} of heaven{H8064}, and for the beasts{H929} of the earth{H776}."
Jeremiah,16,5,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Enter{H935}{(H8799)} not into the house{H1004} of mourning{H4798}, neither go{H3212}{(H8799)} to lament{H5594}{(H8800)} nor bemoan{H5110}{(H8799)} them: for I have taken away{H622}{(H8804)} my peace{H7965} from this people{H5971}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, even lovingkindness{H2617} and mercies{H7356}."
Jeremiah,16,6,"Both the great{H1419} and the small{H6996} shall die{H4191}{(H8804)} in this land{H776}: they shall not be buried{H6912}{(H8735)}, neither shall men lament{H5594}{(H8799)} for them, nor cut{H1413}{(H8704)} themselves, nor make themselves bald{H7139}{(H8735)} for them:"
Jeremiah,16,7,"Neither shall men tear{H6536}{(H8799)} themselves for them in mourning{H60}, to comfort{H5162}{(H8763)} them for the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}; neither shall men give them the cup{H3563} of consolation{H8575} to drink{H8248}{(H8686)} for their father{H1} or for their mother{H517}."

Jeremiah,16,9,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will cause to cease{H7673}{(H8688)} out of this place{H4725} in your eyes{H5869}, and in your days{H3117}, the voice{H6963} of mirth{H8342}, and the voice{H6963} of gladness{H8057}, the voice{H6963} of the bridegroom{H2860}, and the voice{H6963} of the bride{H3618}."
Jeremiah,16,10,"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew{H5046}{(H8686)} this people{H5971} all these words{H1697}, and they shall say{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD{H3068} pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} all this great{H1419} evil{H7451} against us? or what is our iniquity{H5771}? or what is our sin{H2403} that we have committed{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}?"
Jeremiah,16,11,"Then shalt thou say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Because your fathers{H1} have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and have walked{H3212}{(H8799)} after{H310} other{H312} gods{H430}, and have served{H5647}{(H8799)} them, and have worshipped{H7812}{(H8691)} them, and have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} me, and have not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} my law{H8451};"
Jeremiah,16,12,"And ye have done{H6213}{(H8800)} worse{H7489}{(H8689)} than your fathers{H1}; for, behold{H2009}, ye walk{H1980}{(H8802)} every one{H376} after{H310} the imagination{H8307} of his evil{H7451} heart{H3820}, that they may not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto me:"

Jeremiah,17,10,"I the LORD{H3068} search{H2713}{(H8802)} the heart{H3820}, I try{H974}{(H8802)} the reins{H3629}, even to give{H5414}{(H8800)} every man{H376} according to his ways{H1870}, and according to the fruit{H6529} of his doings{H4611}."
Jeremiah,17,11,"As the partridge{H7124} sitteth{H1716}{(H8804)} on eggs, and hatcheth{H3205}{(H8804)} them not; so he that getteth{H6213}{(H8802)} riches{H6239}, and not by right{H4941}, shall leave{H5800}{(H8799)} them in the midst{H2677} of his days{H3117}, and at his end{H319} shall be a fool{H5036}."
Jeremiah,17,12,A glorious{H3519} high{H4791} throne{H3678} from the beginning{H7223} is the place{H4725} of our sanctuary{H4720}.
Jeremiah,17,13,"O LORD{H3068}, the hope{H4723} of Israel{H3478}, all that forsake{H5800}{(H8802)} thee shall be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)}, and they that depart{H3249} from me{H5493}{(H8803)} shall be written{H3789}{(H8735)} in the earth{H776}, because they have forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the fountain{H4726} of living{H2416} waters{H4325}."
Jeremiah,17,14,"Heal{H7495}{(H8798)} me, O LORD{H3068}, and I shall be healed{H7495}{(H8735)}; save{H3467}{(H8685)} me, and I shall be saved{H3467}{(H8735)}: for thou art my praise{H8416}."

Jeremiah,17,16,"As for me, I have not hastened{H213}{(H8804)} from being a pastor{H7462}{(H8802)} to follow{H310} thee: neither have I desired{H183}{(H8694)} the woeful{H605}{(H8803)} day{H3117}; thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)}: that which came out{H4161} of my lips{H8193} was right before{H5227} thee{H6440}."
Jeremiah,17,17,Be not a terror{H4288} unto me: thou art my hope{H4268} in the day{H3117} of evil{H7451}.
Jeremiah,17,18,"Let them be confounded{H954}{(H8799)} that persecute{H7291}{(H8802)} me, but let not me be confounded{H954}{(H8799)}: let them be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}, but let not me be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}: bring{H935}{(H8687)} upon them the day{H3117} of evil{H7451}, and destroy{H7665}{(H8798)} them with double{H4932} destruction{H7670}."
Jeremiah,17,19,"Thus said{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} unto me; Go{H1980}{(H8800)} and stand{H5975}{(H8804)} in the gate{H8179} of the children{H1121} of the people{H5971}, whereby the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} come in{H935}{(H8799)}, and by the which they go out{H3318}{(H8799)}, and in all the gates{H8179} of Jerusalem{H3389};"

Jeremiah,17,23,"But they obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not, neither inclined{H5186}{(H8689)} their ear{H241}, but made their neck{H6203} stiff{H7185}{(H8686)}, that they might not hear{H8085}{(H8800)}, nor receive{H3947}{(H8800)} instruction{H4148}."

Jeremiah,18,15,"Because my people{H5971} hath forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} me, they have burned incense{H6999}{(H8762)} to vanity{H7723}, and they have caused them to stumble{H3782}{(H8686)} in their ways{H1870} from the ancient{H5769} paths{H7635}{(H8675)}{H7635}, to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} in paths{H5410}, in a way{H1870} not cast up{H5549}{(H8803)};"
Jeremiah,18,16,"To make{H7760}{(H8800)} their land{H776} desolate{H8047}, and a perpetual{H5769} hissing{H8292}{(H8675)}{H8292}; every one that passeth{H5674}{(H8802)} thereby shall be astonished{H8074}{(H8799)}, and wag{H5110}{(H8686)} his head{H7218}."
Jeremiah,18,17,"I will scatter{H6327}{(H8686)} them as with an east{H6921} wind{H7307} before{H6440} the enemy{H341}{(H8802)}; I will shew{H7200}{(H8799)} them the back{H6203}, and not the face{H6440}, in the day{H3117} of their calamity{H343}."
Jeremiah,18,18,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} they, Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us devise{H2803}{(H8799)} devices{H4284} against Jeremiah{H3414}; for the law{H8451} shall not perish{H6}{(H8799)} from the priest{H3548}, nor counsel{H6098} from the wise{H2450}, nor the word{H1697} from the prophet{H5030}. Come{H3212}{(H8798)}, and let us smite{H5221}{(H8686)} him with the tongue{H3956}, and let us not give heed{H7181}{(H8686)} to any of his words{H1697}."
Jeremiah,18,19,"Give heed{H7181}{(H8685)} to me, O LORD{H3068}, and hearken{H8085}{(H8798)} to the voice{H6963} of them that contend{H3401} with me."

Remember{H2142}{(H8798)} that I stood{H5975}{(H8800)} before{H6440} thee to speak{H1696}{(H8763)} good{H2896} for them, and to turn away{H7725}{(H8687)} thy wrath{H2534} from them."

Jeremiah,18,23,"Yet, LORD{H3068}, thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)} all their counsel{H6098} against me to slay{H4194} me: forgive{H3722}{(H8762)} not their iniquity{H5771}, neither blot out{H4229}{(H8686)} their sin{H2403} from thy sight{H6440}, but let them be overthrown{H3782}{(H8716)} before{H6440} thee; deal{H6213}{(H8798)} thus with them in the time{H6256} of thine anger{H639}."

Jeremiah,19,11,"And shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; Even so{H3602} will I break{H7665}{(H8799)} this people{H5971} and this city{H5892}, as one breaketh{H7665}{(H8799)} a potter's{H3335}{(H8802)} vessel{H3627}, that cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} be made whole again{H7495}{(H8736)}: and they shall bury{H6912}{(H8799)} them in Tophet{H8612}, till there be no place{H4725} to bury{H6912}{(H8800)}."
Jeremiah,19,12,"Thus will I do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto this place{H4725}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and to the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof, and even make{H5414}{(H8800)} this city{H5892} as Tophet{H8612}:"
Jeremiah,19,13,"And the houses{H1004} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and the houses{H1004} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, shall be defiled{H2931} as the place{H4725} of Tophet{H8612}, because of all the houses{H1004} upon whose roofs{H1406} they have burned incense{H6999}{(H8765)} unto all the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}, and have poured out{H5258}{(H8687)} drink offerings{H5262} unto other{H312} gods{H430}."
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} from Tophet{H8612}, whither the LORD{H3068} had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him to prophesy{H5012}{(H8736)}; and he stood{H5975}{(H8799)} in the court{H2691} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}; and said{H559}{(H8799)} to all the people{H5971},"
Jeremiah,19,15,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} upon this city{H5892} and upon all her towns{H5892} all the evil{H7451} that I have pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} against it, because they have hardened{H7185}{(H8689)} their necks{H6203}, that they might not hear{H8085}{(H8800)} my words{H1697}."
Jeremiah,20,1,"Now Pashur{H6583} the son{H1121} of Immer{H564} the priest{H3548}, who was also chief{H6496} governor{H5057} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that Jeremiah{H3414} prophesied{H5012}{(H8738)} these things{H1697}."
Jeremiah,20,2,"Then Pashur{H6583} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} him in the stocks{H4115} that were in the high{H5945} gate{H8179} of Benjamin{H1144}, which was by the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,20,3,"And it came to pass on the morrow{H4283}, that Pashur{H6583} brought forth{H3318}{(H8686)} Jeremiah{H3414} out of the stocks{H4115}. Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} unto him, The LORD{H3068} hath not called{H7121}{(H8804)} thy name{H8034} Pashur{H6583}, but Magormissabib{H4036}."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will make{H5414}{(H8802)} thee a terror{H4032} to thyself, and to all thy friends{H157}{(H8802)}: and they shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} by the sword{H2719} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and thine eyes{H5869} shall behold{H7200}{(H8802)} it: and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} all Judah{H3063} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and he shall carry them captive{H1540}{(H8689)} into Babylon{H894}, and shall slay{H5221}{(H8689)} them with the sword{H2719}."
Jeremiah,20,5,"Moreover I will deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} all the strength{H2633} of this city{H5892}, and all the labours{H3018} thereof, and all the precious things{H3366} thereof, and all the treasures{H214} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063} will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} into the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, which shall spoil{H962}{(H8804)} them, and take{H3947}{(H8804)} them, and carry{H935}{(H8689)} them to Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,20,6,"And thou, Pashur{H6583}, and all that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in thine house{H1004} shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} into captivity{H7628}: and thou shalt come{H935}{(H8799)} to Babylon{H894}, and there thou shalt die{H4191}{(H8799)}, and shalt be buried{H6912}{(H8735)} there, thou, and all thy friends{H157}{(H8802)}, to whom thou hast prophesied{H5012}{(H8738)} lies{H8267}."
Jeremiah,20,7,"O LORD{H3068}, thou hast deceived{H6601}{(H8765)} me, and I was deceived{H6601}{(H8735)}: thou art stronger{H2388}{(H8804)} than I, and hast prevailed{H3201}{(H8799)}: I am in derision{H7814} daily{H3117}, every one mocketh{H3932}{(H8802)} me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For since{H1767} I spake{H1696}{(H8762)}, I cried out{H2199}{(H8799)}, I cried{H7121}{(H8799)} violence{H2555} and spoil{H7701}; because the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} was made a reproach{H2781} unto me, and a derision{H7047}, daily{H3117}."
Jeremiah,20,9,"Then I said{H559}{(H8804)}, I will not make mention{H2142}{(H8799)} of him, nor speak{H1696}{(H8762)} any more in his name{H8034}. But his word was in mine heart{H3820} as a burning{H1197}{(H8802)} fire{H784} shut up{H6113}{(H8803)} in my bones{H6106}, and I was weary{H3811}{(H8738)} with forbearing{H3557}{(H8771)}, and I could{H3201}{(H8799)} not stay."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the defaming{H1681} of many{H7227}, fear{H4032} on every side{H5439}. Report{H5046}{(H8685)}, say they, and we will report{H5046}{(H8686)} it. All my familiars{H582}{H7965} watched{H8104}{(H8802)} for my halting{H6763}{(H8676)}{H6761}, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed{H6601}{(H8792)}, and we shall prevail{H3201}{(H8799)} against him, and we shall take{H3947}{(H8799)} our revenge{H5360} on him."
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the LORD{H3068} is with me as a mighty{H1368} terrible one{H6184}: therefore my persecutors{H7291}{(H8802)} shall stumble{H3782}{(H8735)}, and they shall not prevail{H3201}{(H8799)}: they shall be greatly{H3966} ashamed{H954}{(H8804)}; for they shall not prosper{H7919}{(H8689)}: their everlasting{H5769} confusion{H3639} shall never be forgotten{H7911}{(H8735)}."
Jeremiah,20,12,"But, O LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, that triest{H974}{(H8802)} the righteous{H6662}, and seest{H7200}{(H8802)} the reins{H3629} and the heart{H3820}, let me see{H7200}{(H8799)} thy vengeance{H5360} on them: for unto thee have I opened{H1540}{(H8765)} my cause{H7379}."
Jeremiah,20,13,"Sing{H7891}{(H8798)} unto the LORD{H3068}, praise{H1984}{(H8761)} ye the LORD{H3068}: for he hath delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} the soul{H5315} of the poor{H34} from the hand{H3027} of evildoers{H7489}{(H8688)}."
Jeremiah,20,14,Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be the day{H3117} wherein I was born{H3205}{(H8795)}: let not the day{H3117} wherein my mother{H517} bare{H3205}{(H8804)} me be blessed{H1288}{(H8803)}.
Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be the man{H376} who brought tidings{H1319}{(H8765)} to my father{H1}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, A man{H2145} child{H1121} is born{H3205}{(H8795)} unto thee; making him very{H8055}{(H8763)} glad{H8055}{(H8765)}."
Jeremiah,20,16,"And let that man{H376} be as the cities{H5892} which the LORD{H3068} overthrew{H2015}{(H8804)}, and repented{H5162}{(H8738)} not: and let him hear{H8085}{(H8804)} the cry{H2201} in the morning{H1242}, and the shouting{H8643} at noontide{H6256}{H6672};"
Jeremiah,20,17,"Because he slew{H4191}{(H8790)} me not from the womb{H7358}; or that my mother{H517} might have been my grave{H6913}, and her womb{H7358} to be always{H5769} great{H2030} with me."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Wherefore came I forth{H3318}{(H8804)} out of the womb{H7358} to see{H7200}{(H8800)} labour{H5999} and sorrow{H3015}, that my days{H3117} should be consumed{H3615}{(H8799)} with shame{H1322}?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"The word{H1697} which came unto Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, when king{H4428} Zedekiah{H6667} sent{H7971}{(H8800)} unto him Pashur{H6583} the son{H1121} of Melchiah{H4441}, and Zephaniah{H6846} the son{H1121} of Maaseiah{H4641} the priest{H3548}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,21,2,"Enquire{H1875}{(H8798)}, I pray thee, of the LORD{H3068} for us{H1157}; for Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} maketh war{H3898}{(H8737)} against us; if so be that the LORD{H3068} will deal{H6213}{(H8799)} with us according to all his wondrous works{H6381}{(H8737)}, that he may go up{H5927}{(H8799)} from us."
Jeremiah,21,3,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} unto them, Thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} to Zedekiah{H6667}:"
Jeremiah,21,4,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will turn back{H5437}{(H8688)} the weapons{H3627} of war{H4421} that are in your hands{H3027}, wherewith ye fight{H3898}{(H8737)} against the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and against the Chaldeans{H3778}, which besiege{H6696}{(H8802)} you without{H2351} the walls{H2346}, and I will assemble{H622}{(H8804)} them into the midst{H8432} of this city{H5892}."
Jeremiah,21,5,"And I myself will fight{H3898}{(H8738)} against you with an outstretched{H5186}{(H8803)} hand{H3027} and with a strong{H2389} arm{H2220}, even in anger{H639}, and in fury{H2534}, and in great{H1419} wrath{H7110}."
Jeremiah,21,6,"And I will smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of this city{H5892}, both man{H120} and beast{H929}: they shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} of a great{H1419} pestilence{H1698}."
Jeremiah,21,7,"And afterward{H310}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, I will deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and his servants{H5650}, and the people{H5971}, and such as are left{H7604}{(H8737)} in this city{H5892} from the pestilence{H1698}, from the sword{H2719}, and from the famine{H7458}, into the hand{H3027} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and into the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and into the hand{H3027} of those that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} their life{H5315}: and he shall smite{H5221}{(H8689)} them with the edge{H6310} of the sword{H2719}; he shall not spare{H2347}{(H8799)} them, neither have pity{H2550}{(H8799)}, nor have mercy{H7355}{(H8762)}."
Jeremiah,21,8,"And unto this people{H5971} thou shalt say{H559}{(H8799)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, I set{H5414}{(H8802)} before{H6440} you the way{H1870} of life{H2416}, and the way{H1870} of death{H4194}."
Jeremiah,21,9,"He that abideth{H3427}{(H8802)} in this city{H5892} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, and by the famine{H7458}, and by the pestilence{H1698}: but he that goeth out{H3318}{(H8802)}, and falleth{H5307}{(H8804)} to the Chaldeans{H3778} that besiege{H6696}{(H8802)} you, he shall live{H2421}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H2421}{(H8799)}, and his life{H5315} shall be unto him for a prey{H7998}."
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set{H7760}{(H8804)} my face{H6440} against this city{H5892} for evil{H7451}, and not for good{H2896}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: it shall be given{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and he shall burn{H8313}{(H8804)} it with fire{H784}."
Jeremiah,21,11,"And touching the house{H1004} of the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, say, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068};"
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house{H1004} of David{H1732}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Execute{H1777}{(H8798)} judgment{H4941} in the morning{H1242}, and deliver{H5337}{(H8685)} him that is spoiled{H1497}{(H8803)} out of the hand{H3027} of the oppressor{H6231}{(H8802)}, lest my fury{H2534} go out{H3318}{(H8799)} like fire{H784}, and burn{H1197}{(H8804)} that none can quench{H3518}{(H8764)} it, because{H6440} of the evil{H7455} of your doings{H4611}."
Jeremiah,21,13,"Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of the valley{H6010}, and rock{H6697} of the plain{H4334}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; which say{H559}{(H8802)}, Who shall come down{H5181}{(H8799)} against us? or who shall enter{H935}{(H8799)} into our habitations{H4585}?"
Jeremiah,21,14,"But I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} you according to the fruit{H6529} of your doings{H4611}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: and I will kindle{H3341}{(H8689)} a fire{H784} in the forest{H3293} thereof, and it shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} all things round about{H5439} it."
Jeremiah,22,1,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Go down{H3381}{(H8798)} to the house{H1004} of the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} there this word{H1697},"
Jeremiah,22,2,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, O king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, that sittest{H3427}{(H8802)} upon the throne{H3678} of David{H1732}, thou, and thy servants{H5650}, and thy people{H5971} that enter{H935}{(H8802)} in by these gates{H8179}:"

Jeremiah,22,4,"For if ye do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697} indeed{H6213}{(H8800)}, then shall there enter in{H935}{(H8804)} by the gates{H8179} of this house{H1004} kings{H4428} sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} upon the throne{H3678} of David{H1732}, riding{H7392}{(H8802)} in chariots{H7393} and on horses{H5483}, he, and his servants{H5650}, and his people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if ye will not hear{H8085}{(H8799)} these words{H1697}, I swear{H7650}{(H8738)} by myself, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that this house{H1004} shall become a desolation{H2723}."
Jeremiah,22,6,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} unto the king's{H4428} house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}; Thou art Gilead{H1568} unto me, and the head{H7218} of Lebanon{H3844}: yet surely I will make{H7896}{(H8799)} thee a wilderness{H4057}, and cities{H5892} which are not inhabited{H3427}{(H8738)}{(H8675)}{H3427}{(H8737)}."
Jeremiah,22,7,"And I will prepare{H6942}{(H8765)} destroyers{H7843}{(H8688)} against thee, every one{H376} with his weapons{H3627}: and they shall cut down{H3772}{(H8804)} thy choice{H4005} cedars{H730}, and cast{H5307}{(H8689)} them into the fire{H784}."

Jeremiah,22,15,"Shalt thou reign{H4427}{(H8799)}, because thou closest{H8474}{(H8808)} thyself in cedar{H730}? did not thy father{H1} eat{H398}{(H8804)} and drink{H8354}{(H8804)}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} judgment{H4941} and justice{H6666}, and then it was well{H2896} with him?"
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged{H1777}{(H8804)} the cause{H1779} of the poor{H6041} and needy{H34}; then it was well{H2896} with him: was not this to know{H1847} me? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}.
Jeremiah,22,17,"But thine eyes{H5869} and thine heart{H3820} are not but for thy covetousness{H1215}, and for to shed{H8210}{(H8800)} innocent{H5355} blood{H1818}, and for oppression{H6233}, and for violence{H4835}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} it."
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} concerning Jehoiakim{H3079} the son{H1121} of Josiah{H2977} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}; They shall not lament{H5594}{(H8799)} for him, saying, Ah{H1945} my brother{H251}! or, Ah{H1945} sister{H269}! they shall not lament{H5594}{(H8799)} for him, saying, Ah{H1945} lord{H113}! or, Ah{H1945} his glory{H1935}!"
Jeremiah,22,19,"He shall be buried{H6912}{(H8735)} with the burial{H6900} of an ass{H2543}, drawn{H5498}{(H8800)} and cast forth{H7993}{(H8687)} beyond{H1973} the gates{H8179} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,22,20,"Go up{H5927}{(H8798)} to Lebanon{H3844}, and cry{H6817}{(H8798)}; and lift up{H5414}{(H8798)} thy voice{H6963} in Bashan{H1316}, and cry{H6817}{(H8798)} from the passages{H5676}: for all thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)} are destroyed{H7665}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto thee in thy prosperity{H7962}; but thou saidst{H559}{(H8804)}, I will not hear{H8085}{(H8799)}. This hath been thy manner{H1870} from thy youth{H5271}, that thou obeyedst{H8085}{(H8804)} not my voice{H6963}."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind{H7307} shall eat up{H7462}{(H8799)} all thy pastors{H7462}{(H8802)}, and thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)} shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} into captivity{H7628}: surely then shalt thou be ashamed{H954}{(H8799)} and confounded{H3637}{(H8738)} for all thy wickedness{H7451}."
Jeremiah,22,23,"O inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)} of Lebanon{H3844}, that makest thy nest{H7077}{(H8794)} in the cedars{H730}, how gracious{H2603}{(H8738)} shalt thou be when pangs{H2256} come{H935}{(H8800)} upon thee, the pain{H2427} as of a woman in travail{H3205}{(H8802)}!"
Jeremiah,22,24,"As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, though Coniah{H3659} the son{H1121} of Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} were the signet{H2368} upon my right{H3225} hand{H3027}, yet would I pluck{H5423}{(H8799)} thee thence;"
Jeremiah,22,25,"And I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee into the hand{H3027} of them that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} thy life{H5315}, and into the hand{H3027} of them whose face{H6440} thou fearest{H3016}{(H8801)}, even into the hand{H3027} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and into the hand{H3027} of the Chaldeans{H3778}."
Jeremiah,22,26,"And I will cast thee out{H2904}{(H8689)}, and thy mother{H517} that bare{H3205}{(H8804)} thee, into another{H312} country{H776}, where ye were not born{H3205}{(H8795)}; and there shall ye die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,22,27,"But to the land{H776} whereunto they desire{H5375}{(H8764)}{(H8676)}{H5315} to return{H7725}{(H8800)}, thither shall they not return{H7725}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man{H376} Coniah{H3659} a despised{H959}{(H8737)} broken{H5310}{(H8803)} idol{H6089}? is he a vessel{H3627} wherein is no pleasure{H2656}? wherefore are they cast out{H7993}{(H8717)}, he and his seed{H2233}, and are cast{H2904}{(H8717)} into a land{H776} which they know{H3045}{(H8804)} not?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O earth{H776}, earth{H776}, earth{H776}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Write{H3789}{(H8798)} ye this man{H376} childless{H6185}, a man{H1397} that shall not prosper{H6743}{(H8799)} in his days{H3117}: for no man{H376} of his seed{H2233} shall prosper{H6743}{(H8799)}, sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} upon the throne{H3678} of David{H1732}, and ruling{H4910}{(H8802)} any more in Judah{H3063}."
Jeremiah,23,1,Woe{H1945} be unto the pastors{H7462}{(H8802)} that destroy{H6}{(H8764)} and scatter{H6327}{(H8688)} the sheep{H6629} of my pasture{H4830}! saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} God{H430} of Israel{H3478} against the pastors{H7462}{(H8802)} that feed{H7462}{(H8802)} my people{H5971}; Ye have scattered{H6327}{(H8689)} my flock{H6629}, and driven them away{H5080}{(H8686)}, and have not visited{H6485}{(H8804)} them: behold, I will visit{H6485}{(H8802)} upon you the evil{H7455} of your doings{H4611}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,3,"And I will gather{H6908}{(H8762)} the remnant{H7611} of my flock{H6629} out of all countries{H776} whither I have driven{H5080}{(H8689)} them, and will bring them again{H7725}{(H8689)} to their folds{H5116}; and they shall be fruitful{H6509}{(H8804)} and increase{H7235}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,23,4,"And I will set up{H6965}{(H8689)} shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} over them which shall feed{H7462}{(H8804)} them: and they shall fear{H3372}{(H8799)} no more, nor be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)}, neither shall they be lacking{H6485}{(H8735)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,5,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will raise{H6965}{(H8689)} unto David{H1732} a righteous{H6662} Branch{H6780}, and a King{H4428} shall reign{H4427}{(H8804)} and prosper{H7919}{(H8689)}, and shall execute{H6213}{(H8804)} judgment{H4941} and justice{H6666} in the earth{H776}."
Jeremiah,23,6,"In his days{H3117} Judah{H3063} shall be saved{H3467}{(H8735)}, and Israel{H3478} shall dwell{H7931}{(H8799)} safely{H983}: and this is his name{H8034} whereby he shall be called{H7121}{(H8799)}, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS{H3072}."
Jeremiah,23,7,"Therefore, behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that they shall no more say{H559}{(H8799)}, The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, which brought up{H5927}{(H8689)} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714};"
Jeremiah,23,8,"But, The LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, which brought up{H5927}{(H8689)} and which led{H935}{(H8689)} the seed{H2233} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} out of the north{H6828} country{H776}, and from all countries{H776} whither I had driven{H5080}{(H8689)} them; and they shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} in their own land{H127}."
Jeremiah,23,9,"Mine heart{H3820} within{H7130} me is broken{H7665}{(H8738)} because of the prophets{H5030}; all my bones{H6106} shake{H7363}{(H8804)}; I am like a drunken{H7910} man{H376}, and like a man{H1397} whom wine{H3196} hath overcome{H5674}{(H8804)}, because{H6440} of the LORD{H3068}, and because of the words{H1697} of his holiness{H6944}."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land{H776} is full{H4390}{(H8804)} of adulterers{H5003}{(H8764)}; for because{H6440} of swearing{H423} the land{H776} mourneth{H56}{(H8804)}; the pleasant places{H4999} of the wilderness{H4057} are dried up{H3001}{(H8804)}, and their course{H4794} is evil{H7451}, and their force{H1369} is not right."
Jeremiah,23,11,"For both prophet{H5030} and priest{H3548} are profane{H2610}{(H8804)}; yea, in my house{H1004} have I found{H4672}{(H8804)} their wickedness{H7451}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,12,"Wherefore their way{H1870} shall be unto them as slippery{H2519} ways in the darkness{H653}: they shall be driven on{H1760}{(H8735)}, and fall{H5307}{(H8804)} therein: for I will bring{H935}{(H8686)} evil{H7451} upon them, even the year{H8141} of their visitation{H6486}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,13,"And I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} folly{H8604} in the prophets{H5030} of Samaria{H8111}; they prophesied{H5012}{(H8694)} in Baal{H1168}, and caused my people{H5971} Israel{H3478} to err{H8582}{(H8686)}."
Jeremiah,23,14,"I have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} also in the prophets{H5030} of Jerusalem{H3389} an horrible thing{H8186}: they commit adultery{H5003}{(H8800)}, and walk{H1980}{(H8800)} in lies{H8267}: they strengthen{H2388}{(H8765)} also the hands{H3027} of evildoers{H7489}{(H8688)}, that none{H376} doth return{H7725}{(H8804)} from his wickedness{H7451}: they are all of them unto me as Sodom{H5467}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} thereof as Gomorrah{H6017}."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} concerning the prophets{H5030}; Behold, I will feed{H398}{(H8688)} them with wormwood{H3939}, and make them drink{H8248}{(H8689)} the water{H4325} of gall{H7219}: for from the prophets{H5030} of Jerusalem{H3389} is profaneness{H2613} gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)} into all the land{H776}."
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, Hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} not unto the words{H1697} of the prophets{H5030} that prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)} unto you: they make you vain{H1891}{(H8688)}: they speak{H1696}{(H8762)} a vision{H2377} of their own heart{H3820}, and not out of the mouth{H6310} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They say{H559}{(H8802)} still{H559}{(H8800)} unto them that despise{H5006}{(H8764)} me, The LORD{H3068} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)}, Ye shall have peace{H7965}; and they say{H559}{(H8804)} unto every one that walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} after the imagination{H8307} of his own heart{H3820}, No evil{H7451} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} upon you."
Jeremiah,23,18,"For who hath stood{H5975}{(H8804)} in the counsel{H5475} of the LORD{H3068}, and hath perceived{H7200}{(H8799)} and heard{H8085}{(H8799)} his word{H1697}? who hath marked{H7181}{(H8689)} his word{H1697}, and heard{H8085}{(H8799)} it?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, a whirlwind{H5591} of the LORD{H3068} is gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)} in fury{H2534}, even a grievous{H2342}{(H8711)} whirlwind{H5591}: it shall fall grievously{H2342}{(H8799)} upon the head{H7218} of the wicked{H7563}."
Jeremiah,23,20,"The anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)}, until he have executed{H6213}{(H8800)}, and till he have performed{H6965}{(H8687)} the thoughts{H4209} of his heart{H3820}: in the latter{H319} days{H3117} ye shall consider{H995}{(H8709)} it perfectly{H998}."
Jeremiah,23,21,"I have not sent{H7971}{(H8804)} these prophets{H5030}, yet they ran{H7323}{(H8804)}: I have not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} to them, yet they prophesied{H5012}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood{H5975}{(H8804)} in my counsel{H5475}, and had caused my people{H5971} to hear{H8085}{(H8686)} my words{H1697}, then they should have turned{H7725}{(H8686)} them from their evil{H7451} way{H1870}, and from the evil{H7455} of their doings{H4611}."
Jeremiah,23,23,"Am I a God{H430} at hand{H7138}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and not a God{H430} afar off{H7350}?"
Jeremiah,23,24,Can any{H376} hide{H5641}{(H8735)} himself in secret places{H4565} that I shall not see{H7200}{(H8799)} him? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}. Do not I fill{H4392} heaven{H8064} and earth{H776}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}.
Jeremiah,23,25,"I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} what the prophets{H5030} said{H559}{(H8804)}, that prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)} lies{H8267} in my name{H8034}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I have dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)}, I have dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long shall this be{H3426} in the heart{H3820} of the prophets{H5030} that prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)} lies{H8267}? yea, they are prophets{H5030} of the deceit{H8649} of their own heart{H3820};"
Jeremiah,23,27,"Which think{H2803}{(H8802)} to cause my people{H5971} to forget{H7911}{(H8687)} my name{H8034} by their dreams{H2472} which they tell{H5608}{(H8762)} every man{H376} to his neighbour{H7453}, as their fathers{H1} have forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} my name{H8034} for Baal{H1168}."
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet{H5030} that hath a dream{H2472}, let him tell{H5608}{(H8762)} a dream{H2472}; and he that hath my word{H1697}, let him speak{H1696}{(H8762)} my word{H1697} faithfully{H571}. What is the chaff{H8401} to the wheat{H1250}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,29,Is not my word{H1697} like{H3541} as a fire{H784}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; and like a hammer{H6360} that breaketh{H6327} the rock{H5553} in pieces{H6327}{(H8787)}?
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets{H5030}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that steal{H1589}{(H8764)} my words{H1697} every one{H376} from his neighbour{H7453}."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against the prophets{H5030}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that use{H3947}{(H8802)} their tongues{H3956}, and say{H5001}{(H8799)}, He saith{H5002}{(H8803)}."
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against them that prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)} false{H8267} dreams{H2472}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and do tell{H5608}{(H8762)} them, and cause my people{H5971} to err{H8582}{(H8686)} by their lies{H8267}, and by their lightness{H6350}; yet I sent{H7971}{(H8804)} them not, nor commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them: therefore they shall not profit{H3276}{(H8686)} this people{H5971} at all{H3276}{(H8687)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,33,"And when this people{H5971}, or the prophet{H5030}, or a priest{H3548}, shall ask{H7592}{(H8799)} thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, What is the burden{H4853} of the LORD{H3068}? thou shalt then say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, What burden{H4853}? I will even forsake{H5203}{(H8804)} you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,23,34,"And as for the prophet{H5030}, and the priest{H3548}, and the people{H5971}, that shall say{H559}{(H8799)}, The burden{H4853} of the LORD{H3068}, I will even punish{H6485}{(H8804)} that man{H376} and his house{H1004}."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} every one{H376} to his neighbour{H7453}, and every one{H376} to his brother{H251}, What hath the LORD{H3068} answered{H6030}{(H8804)}? and, What hath the LORD{H3068} spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}?"
Jeremiah,23,36,"And the burden{H4853} of the LORD{H3068} shall ye mention{H2142}{(H8799)} no more: for every man's{H376} word{H1697} shall be his burden{H4853}; for ye have perverted{H2015}{(H8804)} the words{H1697} of the living{H2416} God{H430}, of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} our God{H430}."

Jeremiah,23,38,"But{H518} since ye say{H559}{(H8799)}, The burden{H4853} of the LORD{H3068}; therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Because ye say{H559}{(H8800)} this word{H1697}, The burden{H4853} of the LORD{H3068}, and I have sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Ye shall not say{H559}{(H8799)}, The burden{H4853} of the LORD{H3068};"
Jeremiah,23,39,"Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly{H5377}{(H8800)} forget{H5382}{(H8804)} you, and I will forsake{H5203}{(H8804)} you, and the city{H5892} that I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} you and your fathers{H1}, and cast you out of my presence{H6440}:"
Jeremiah,23,40,"And I will bring{H5414}{(H8804)} an everlasting{H5769} reproach{H2781} upon you, and a perpetual{H5769} shame{H3640}, which shall not be forgotten{H7911}{(H8735)}."
Jeremiah,24,1,"The LORD{H3068} shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} me, and, behold, two{H8147} baskets{H1736} of figs{H8384} were set{H3259}{(H8716)} before{H6440} the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, after{H310} that Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} had carried away captive{H1540}{(H8687)} Jeconiah{H3204} the son{H1121} of Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063}, with the carpenters{H2796} and smiths{H4525}, from Jerusalem{H3389}, and had brought{H935}{(H8686)} them to Babylon{H894}."

Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, I will cast{H7971}{(H8764)} thee from off the face{H6440} of the earth{H127}: this year{H8141} thou shalt die{H4191}{(H8801)}, because thou hast taught{H1696}{(H8765)} rebellion{H5627} against the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah{H2608} the prophet{H5030} died{H4191}{(H8799)} the same year{H8141} in the seventh{H7637} month{H2320}.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words{H1697} of the letter{H5612} that Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} sent{H7971}{(H8804)} from Jerusalem{H3389} unto the residue{H3499} of the elders{H2205} which were carried away captives{H1473}, and to the priests{H3548}, and to the prophets{H5030}, and to all the people{H5971} whom Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} had carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)} from Jerusalem{H3389} to Babylon{H894};"
Jeremiah,29,2,"(After{H310} that Jeconiah{H3204} the king{H4428}, and the queen{H1377}, and the eunuchs{H5631}, the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063} and Jerusalem{H3389}, and the carpenters{H2796}, and the smiths{H4525}, were departed{H3318}{(H8800)} from Jerusalem{H3389};)"

Jeremiah,29,6,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} ye wives{H802}, and beget{H3205}{(H8685)} sons{H1121} and daughters{H1323}; and take{H3947}{(H8798)} wives{H802} for your sons{H1121}, and give{H5414}{(H8798)} your daughters{H1323} to husbands{H582}, that they may bear{H3205}{(H8799)} sons{H1121} and daughters{H1121}; that ye may be increased{H7235}{(H8798)} there, and not diminished{H4591}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,29,7,"And seek{H1875}{(H8798)} the peace{H7965} of the city{H5892} whither I have caused you to be carried away captives{H1540}{(H8689)}, and pray{H6419}{(H8690)} unto the LORD{H3068} for it: for in the peace{H7965} thereof shall ye have peace{H7965}."
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Let not your prophets{H5030} and your diviners{H7080}{(H8802)}, that be in the midst{H7130} of you, deceive{H5377}{(H8686)} you, neither hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} to your dreams{H2472} which ye cause to be dreamed{H2492}{(H8688)}."
Jeremiah,29,9,"For they prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)} falsely{H8267} unto you in my name{H8034}: I have not sent{H7971}{(H8804)} them, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,29,10,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, That after{H6310} seventy{H7657} years{H8141} be accomplished{H4390}{(H8800)} at Babylon{H894} I will visit{H6485}{(H8799)} you, and perform{H6965}{(H8689)} my good{H2896} word{H1697} toward you, in causing you to return{H7725}{(H8687)} to this place{H4725}."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know{H3045}{(H8804)} the thoughts{H4284} that I think{H2803}{(H8802)} toward you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, thoughts{H4284} of peace{H7965}, and not of evil{H7451}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} you an expected{H8615} end{H319}."

Jeremiah,29,14,"And I will be found{H4672}{(H8738)} of you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: and I will turn away{H7725}{(H8804)} your captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622}, and I will gather{H6908}{(H8765)} you from all the nations{H1471}, and from all the places{H4725} whither I have driven{H5080}{(H8689)} you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; and I will bring you again{H7725}{(H8689)} into the place{H4725} whence I caused you to be carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)}."
Jeremiah,29,15,"Because ye have said{H559}{(H8804)}, The LORD{H3068} hath raised us up{H6965}{(H8689)} prophets{H5030} in Babylon{H894};"
Jeremiah,29,16,"Know that thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of the king{H4428} that sitteth{H3427}{(H8802)} upon the throne{H3678} of David{H1732}, and of all the people{H5971} that dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} in this city{H5892}, and of your brethren{H251} that are not gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)} with you into captivity{H1473};"

Jeremiah,29,27,"Now therefore why hast thou not reproved{H1605}{(H8804)} Jeremiah{H3414} of Anathoth{H6069}, which maketh himself a prophet{H5012}{(H8693)} to you?"
Jeremiah,29,28,"For therefore he sent{H7971}{(H8804)} unto us in Babylon{H894}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, This{H1931} captivity is long{H752}: build{H1129}{(H8798)} ye houses{H1004}, and dwell{H3427}{(H8798)} in them; and plant{H5193}{(H8798)} gardens{H1593}, and eat{H398}{(H8798)} the fruit{H6529} of them."
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah{H6846} the priest{H3548} read{H7121}{(H8799)} this letter{H5612} in the ears{H241} of Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}.

Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, to save{H3467}{(H8687)} thee: though I make{H6213}{(H8799)} a full end{H3617} of all nations{H1471} whither I have scattered{H6327}{(H8689)} thee, yet will I not make{H6213}{(H8799)} a full end{H3617} of thee: but I will correct{H3256}{(H8765)} thee in measure{H4941}, and will not leave thee altogether{H5352}{(H8763)} unpunished{H5352}{(H8762)}."
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Thy bruise{H7667} is incurable{H605}{(H8803)}, and thy wound{H4347} is grievous{H2470}{(H8737)}."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is none to plead{H1777}{(H8802)} thy cause{H1779}, that thou mayest be bound up{H4205}: thou hast no healing{H8585} medicines{H7499}."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)} have forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} thee; they seek{H1875}{(H8799)} thee not; for I have wounded{H5221}{(H8689)} thee with the wound{H4347} of an enemy{H341}{(H8802)}, with the chastisement{H4148} of a cruel one{H394}, for the multitude{H7230} of thine iniquity{H5771}; because thy sins{H2403} were increased{H6105}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why criest{H2199}{(H8799)} thou for thine affliction{H7667}? thy sorrow{H4341} is incurable{H605}{(H8803)} for the multitude{H7230} of thine iniquity{H5771}: because thy sins{H2403} were increased{H6105}{(H8804)}, I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} these things unto thee."
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all they that devour{H398}{(H8802)} thee shall be devoured{H398}{(H8735)}; and all thine adversaries{H6862}, every one of them, shall go{H3212}{(H8799)} into captivity{H7628}; and they that spoil{H7601}{(H8802)}{(H8675)}{H8154}{(H8802)} thee shall be a spoil{H4933}, and all that prey{H962}{(H8802)} upon thee will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} for a prey{H957}."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore{H5927}{(H8686)} health{H724} unto thee, and I will heal{H7495}{(H8799)} thee of thy wounds{H4347}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; because they called{H7121}{(H8804)} thee an Outcast{H5080}{(H8737)}, saying, This is Zion{H6726}, whom no man seeketh after{H1875}{(H8802)}."

Jeremiah,30,19,"And out of them shall proceed{H3318}{(H8804)} thanksgiving{H8426} and the voice{H6963} of them that make merry{H7832}{(H8764)}: and I will multiply{H7235}{(H8689)} them, and they shall not be few{H4591}{(H8799)}; I will also glorify{H3513}{(H8689)} them, and they shall not be small{H6819}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their children{H1121} also shall be as aforetime{H6924}, and their congregation{H5712} shall be established{H3559}{(H8735)} before{H6440} me, and I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} all that oppress{H3905}{(H8801)} them."
Jeremiah,30,21,"And their nobles{H117} shall be of themselves, and their governor{H4910}{(H8802)} shall proceed{H3318}{(H8799)} from the midst{H7130} of them; and I will cause him to draw near{H7126}{(H8689)}, and he shall approach{H5066}{(H8738)} unto me: for who is this that engaged{H6148}{(H8804)} his heart{H3820} to approach{H5066}{(H8800)} unto me? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,30,22,"And ye shall be my people{H5971}, and I will be your God{H430}."
Jeremiah,30,23,"Behold, the whirlwind{H5591} of the LORD{H3068} goeth forth{H3318}{(H8804)} with fury{H2534}, a continuing{H1641}{(H8706)} whirlwind{H5591}: it shall fall with pain{H2342}{(H8799)} upon the head{H7218} of the wicked{H7563}."
Jeremiah,30,24,"The fierce{H2740} anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)}, until he have done{H6213}{(H8800)} it, and until he have performed{H6965}{(H8687)} the intents{H4209} of his heart{H3820}: in the latter{H319} days{H3117} ye shall consider{H995}{(H8709)} it."
Jeremiah,31,1,"At the same time{H6256}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, will I be the God{H430} of all the families{H4940} of Israel{H3478}, and they shall be my people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,31,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, The people{H5971} which were left{H8300} of the sword{H2719} found{H4672}{(H8804)} grace{H2580} in the wilderness{H4057}; even Israel{H3478}, when I went{H1980}{(H8800)} to cause him to rest{H7280}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,31,3,"The LORD{H3068} hath appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} of old{H7350} unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved{H157}{(H8804)} thee with an everlasting{H5769} love{H160}: therefore with lovingkindness{H2617} have I drawn{H4900}{(H8804)} thee."
Jeremiah,31,4,"Again I will build{H1129}{(H8799)} thee, and thou shalt be built{H1129}{(H8738)}, O virgin{H1330} of Israel{H3478}: thou shalt again be adorned{H5710}{(H8799)} with thy tabrets{H8596}, and shalt go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} in the dances{H4234} of them that make merry{H7832}{(H8764)}."
Jeremiah,31,5,"Thou shalt yet plant{H5193}{(H8799)} vines{H3754} upon the mountains{H2022} of Samaria{H8111}: the planters{H5193}{(H8802)} shall plant{H5193}{(H8804)}, and shall eat them as common things{H2490}{(H8765)}."
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there shall be{H3426} a day{H3117}, that the watchmen{H5341}{(H8802)} upon the mount{H2022} Ephraim{H669} shall cry{H7121}{(H8804)}, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)} ye, and let us go up{H5927}{(H8799)} to Zion{H6726} unto the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Sing{H7442}{(H8798)} with gladness{H8057} for Jacob{H3290}, and shout{H6670}{(H8761)} among the chief{H7218} of the nations{H1471}: publish{H8085}{(H8685)} ye, praise{H1984}{(H8761)} ye, and say{H559}{(H8798)}, O LORD{H3068}, save{H3467}{(H8685)} thy people{H5971}, the remnant{H7611} of Israel{H3478}."
Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} them from the north{H6828} country{H776}, and gather{H6908}{(H8765)} them from the coasts{H3411} of the earth{H776}, and with them the blind{H5787} and the lame{H6455}, the woman with child{H2030} and her that travaileth with child{H3205}{(H8802)} together{H3162}: a great{H1419} company{H6951} shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} thither."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come{H935}{(H8799)} with weeping{H1065}, and with supplications{H8469} will I lead{H2986}{(H8686)} them: I will cause them to walk{H3212}{(H8686)} by the rivers{H5158} of waters{H4325} in a straight{H3477} way{H1870}, wherein they shall not stumble{H3782}{(H8735)}: for I am a father{H1} to Israel{H3478}, and Ephraim{H669} is my firstborn{H1060}."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, O ye nations{H1471}, and declare{H5046}{(H8685)} it in the isles{H339} afar off{H4801}, and say{H559}{(H8798)}, He that scattered{H2219}{(H8764)} Israel{H3478} will gather{H6908}{(H8762)} him, and keep{H8104}{(H8804)} him, as a shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)} doth his flock{H5739}."
Jeremiah,31,11,"For the LORD{H3068} hath redeemed{H6299}{(H8804)} Jacob{H3290}, and ransomed{H1350}{(H8804)} him from the hand{H3027} of him that was stronger{H2389} than he."
Jeremiah,31,12,"Therefore they shall come{H935}{(H8804)} and sing{H7442}{(H8765)} in the height{H4791} of Zion{H6726}, and shall flow together{H5102}{(H8804)} to the goodness{H2898} of the LORD{H3068}, for wheat{H1715}, and for wine{H8492}, and for oil{H3323}, and for the young{H1121} of the flock{H6629} and of the herd{H1241}: and their soul{H5315} shall be as a watered{H7302} garden{H1588}; and they shall not sorrow{H1669}{(H8800)} any more{H3254}{(H8686)} at all."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then shall the virgin{H1330} rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)} in the dance{H4234}, both young men{H970} and old{H2205} together{H3162}: for I will turn{H2015}{(H8804)} their mourning{H60} into joy{H8342}, and will comfort{H5162}{(H8765)} them, and make them rejoice{H8055}{(H8765)} from their sorrow{H3015}."
Jeremiah,31,14,"And I will satiate{H7301}{(H8765)} the soul{H5315} of the priests{H3548} with fatness{H1880}, and my people{H5971} shall be satisfied{H7646}{(H8799)} with my goodness{H2898}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; A voice{H6963} was heard{H8085}{(H8738)} in Ramah{H7414}, lamentation{H5092}, and bitter{H8563} weeping{H1065}; Rahel{H7354} weeping{H1058}{(H8764)} for her children{H1121} refused{H3985}{(H8765)} to be comforted{H5162}{(H8736)} for her children{H1121}, because they were not."
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Refrain{H4513}{(H8798)} thy voice{H6963} from weeping{H1065}, and thine eyes{H5869} from tears{H1832}: for thy work{H6468} shall be{H3426} rewarded{H7939}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; and they shall come again{H7725}{(H8804)} from the land{H776} of the enemy{H341}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,31,17,"And there is{H3426} hope{H8615} in thine end{H319}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that thy children{H1121} shall come again{H7725}{(H8804)} to their own border{H1366}."
Jeremiah,31,18,"I have surely{H8085}{(H8800)} heard{H8085}{(H8804)} Ephraim{H669} bemoaning{H5110}{(H8711)} himself thus; Thou hast chastised{H3256}{(H8765)} me, and I was chastised{H3256}{(H8735)}, as a bullock{H5695} unaccustomed{H3808}{H3925}{(H8795)} to the yoke: turn{H7725}{(H8685)} thou me, and I shall be turned{H7725}{(H8799)}; for thou art the LORD{H3068} my God{H430}."
Jeremiah,31,19,"Surely after{H310} that I was turned{H7725}{(H8800)}, I repented{H5162}{(H8738)}; and after{H310} that I was instructed{H3045}{(H8736)}, I smote{H5606}{(H8804)} upon my thigh{H3409}: I was ashamed{H954}{(H8804)}, yea, even confounded{H3637}{(H8738)}, because I did bear{H5375}{(H8804)} the reproach{H2781} of my youth{H5271}."
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim{H669} my dear{H3357} son{H1121}? is he a pleasant{H8191} child{H3206}? for since{H1767} I spake{H1696}{(H8763)} against him, I do earnestly{H2142}{(H8800)} remember{H2142}{(H8799)} him still: therefore my bowels{H4578} are troubled{H1993}{(H8804)} for him; I will surely{H7355}{(H8763)} have mercy{H7355}{(H8762)} upon him, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,31,21,"Set thee up{H5324}{(H8685)} waymarks{H6725}, make{H7760}{(H8798)} thee high heaps{H8564}: set{H7896}{(H8798)} thine heart{H3820} toward the highway{H4546}, even the way{H1870} which thou wentest{H1980}{(H8804)}: turn again{H7725}{(H8798)}, O virgin{H1330} of Israel{H3478}, turn again{H7725}{(H8798)} to these thy cities{H5892}."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long wilt thou go about{H2559}{(H8691)}, O thou backsliding{H7728} daughter{H1323}? for the LORD{H3068} hath created{H1254}{(H8804)} a new thing{H2319} in the earth{H776}, A woman{H5347} shall compass{H5437}{(H8779)} a man{H1397}."
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; As yet they shall use{H559}{(H8799)} this speech{H1697} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063} and in the cities{H5892} thereof, when I shall bring again{H7725}{(H8800)} their captivity{H7622}; The LORD{H3068} bless{H1288}{(H8762)} thee, O habitation{H5116} of justice{H6664}, and mountain{H2022} of holiness{H6944}."
Jeremiah,31,24,"And there shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} in Judah{H3063} itself, and in all the cities{H5892} thereof together{H3162}, husbandmen{H406}, and they that go forth{H5265}{(H8804)} with flocks{H5739}."
Jeremiah,31,25,"For I have satiated{H7301}{(H8689)} the weary{H5889} soul{H5315}, and I have replenished{H4390}{(H8765)} every sorrowful{H1669}{(H8804)} soul{H5315}."
Jeremiah,31,26,"Upon this I awaked{H6974}{(H8689)}, and beheld{H7200}{(H8799)}; and my sleep{H8142} was sweet{H6149}{(H8804)} unto me."
Jeremiah,31,27,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will sow{H2232}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} with the seed{H2233} of man{H120}, and with the seed{H2233} of beast{H929}."
Jeremiah,31,28,"And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over{H8245}{(H8804)} them, to pluck up{H5428}{(H8800)}, and to break down{H5422}{(H8800)}, and to throw down{H2040}{(H8800)}, and to destroy{H6}{(H8687)}, and to afflict{H7489}{(H8687)}; so will I watch over{H8245}{(H8799)} them, to build{H1129}{(H8800)}, and to plant{H5193}{(H8800)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,31,29,"In those days{H3117} they shall say{H559}{(H8799)} no more, The fathers{H1} have eaten{H398}{(H8804)} a sour grape{H1155}, and the children's{H1121} teeth{H8127} are set on edge{H6949}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,31,30,"But every one{H376} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} for his own iniquity{H5771}: every man{H120} that eateth{H398}{(H8802)} the sour grape{H1155}, his teeth{H8127} shall be set on edge{H6949}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,31,31,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will make{H3772}{(H8804)} a new{H2319} covenant{H1285} with the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, and with the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063}:"
Jeremiah,31,32,"Not according to the covenant{H1285} that I made{H3772}{(H8804)} with their fathers{H1} in the day{H3117} that I took{H2388}{(H8687)} them by the hand{H3027} to bring them out{H3318}{(H8687)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}; which my covenant{H1285} they brake{H6565}{(H8689)}, although I was an husband{H1166}{(H8804)} unto them, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}:"
Jeremiah,31,33,"But this shall be the covenant{H1285} that I will make{H3772}{(H8799)} with the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; After{H310} those days{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, I will put{H5414}{(H8804)} my law{H8451} in their inward parts{H7130}, and write{H3789}{(H8799)} it in their hearts{H3820}; and will be their God{H430}, and they shall be my people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,31,34,"And they shall teach{H3925}{(H8762)} no more every man{H376} his neighbour{H7453}, and every man{H376} his brother{H251}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Know{H3045}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068}: for they shall all know{H3045}{(H8799)} me, from the least{H6996} of them unto the greatest{H1419} of them, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: for I will forgive{H5545}{(H8799)} their iniquity{H5771}, and I will remember{H2142}{(H8799)} their sin{H2403} no more."
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, which giveth{H5414}{(H8802)} the sun{H8121} for a light{H216} by day{H3119}, and the ordinances{H2708} of the moon{H3394} and of the stars{H3556} for a light{H216} by night{H3915}, which divideth{H7280}{(H8802)} the sea{H3220} when the waves{H1530} thereof roar{H1993}{(H8799)}; The LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} is his name{H8034}:"
Jeremiah,31,36,"If those ordinances{H2706} depart{H4185}{(H8799)} from before{H6440} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, then the seed{H2233} of Israel{H3478} also shall cease{H7673}{(H8799)} from being a nation{H1471} before{H6440} me for ever{H3117}."
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; If heaven{H8064} above{H4605} can be measured{H4058}{(H8735)}, and the foundations{H4146} of the earth{H776} searched out{H2713}{(H8735)} beneath{H4295}, I will also cast off{H3988}{(H8799)} all the seed{H2233} of Israel{H3478} for all that they have done{H6213}{(H8804)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,31,38,"Behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that the city{H5892} shall be built{H1129}{(H8738)} to the LORD{H3068} from the tower{H4026} of Hananeel{H2606} unto the gate{H8179} of the corner{H6438}."
Jeremiah,31,39,"And the measuring{H4060} line{H6957}{(H8675)}{H6961} shall yet go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} over against it upon the hill{H1389} Gareb{H1619}, and shall compass about{H5437}{(H8738)} to Goath{H1601}."
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the whole valley{H6010} of the dead bodies{H6297}, and of the ashes{H1880}, and all the fields{H7709}{(H8675)}{H8309} unto the brook{H5158} of Kidron{H6939}, unto the corner{H6438} of the horse{H5483} gate{H8179} toward the east{H4217}, shall be holy{H6944} unto the LORD{H3068}; it shall not be plucked up{H5428}{(H8735)}, nor thrown down{H2040}{(H8735)} any more for ever{H5769}."
Jeremiah,32,1,"The word{H1697} that came to Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068} in the tenth{H6224} year{H8141} of Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, which was the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240}{H8141} year{H8141} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019}."
Jeremiah,32,2,"For then the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} army{H2428} besieged{H6696}{(H8802)} Jerusalem{H3389}: and Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} was shut up{H3607}{(H8803)} in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}, which was in the king{H4428} of Judah's{H3063} house{H1004}."
Jeremiah,32,3,"For Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} had shut him up{H3607}{(H8804)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Wherefore dost thou prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)}, and say{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, Behold, I will give{H5414}{(H8802)} this city{H5892} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and he shall take{H3920}{(H8804)} it;"
Jeremiah,32,4,"And Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} shall not escape{H4422}{(H8735)} out of the hand{H3027} of the Chaldeans{H3778}, but shall surely{H5414}{(H8736)} be delivered{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and shall speak{H1696}{(H8765)} with him mouth{H6310} to mouth{H6310}, and his eyes{H5869} shall behold{H7200}{(H8799)} his eyes{H5869};"
Jeremiah,32,5,"And he shall lead{H3212}{(H8686)} Zedekiah{H6667} to Babylon{H894}, and there shall he be until I visit{H6485}{(H8800)} him, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: though ye fight{H3898}{(H8735)} with the Chaldeans{H3778}, ye shall not prosper{H6743}{(H8686)}."
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)}, The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,32,7,"Behold, Hanameel{H2601} the son{H1121} of Shallum{H7967} thine uncle{H1730} shall come{H935}{(H8802)} unto thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Buy{H7069}{(H8798)} thee my field{H7704} that is in Anathoth{H6068}: for the right{H4941} of redemption{H1353} is thine to buy{H7069}{(H8800)} it."
Jeremiah,32,8,"So Hanameel{H2601} mine uncle's{H1730} son{H1121} came{H935}{(H8799)} to me in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307} according to the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Buy{H7069}{(H8798)} my field{H7704}, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth{H6068}, which is in the country{H776} of Benjamin{H1144}: for the right{H4941} of inheritance{H3425} is thine, and the redemption{H1353} is thine; buy{H7069}{(H8798)} it for thyself. Then I knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that this was the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,32,9,"And I bought{H7069}{(H8799)} the field{H7704} of Hanameel{H2601} my uncle's{H1730} son{H1121}, that was in Anathoth{H6068}, and weighed{H8254}{(H8799)} him the money{H3701}, even seventeen{H7651}{H6235} shekels{H8255} of silver{H3701}."
Jeremiah,32,10,"And I subscribed{H3789}{(H8799)} the evidence{H5612}, and sealed{H2856}{(H8799)} it, and took{H5749}{(H8686)} witnesses{H5707}, and weighed{H8254}{(H8799)} him the money{H3701} in the balances{H3976}."
Jeremiah,32,11,"So I took{H3947}{(H8799)} the evidence{H5612} of the purchase{H4736}, both that which was sealed{H2856}{(H8803)} according to the law{H4687} and custom{H2706}, and that which was open{H1540}{(H8803)}:"
Jeremiah,32,12,"And I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} the evidence{H5612} of the purchase{H4736} unto Baruch{H1263} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374}, the son{H1121} of Maaseiah{H4271}, in the sight{H5869} of Hanameel{H2601} mine uncle's{H1730} son, and in the presence{H5869} of the witnesses{H5707} that subscribed{H3789}{(H8802)} the book{H5612} of the purchase{H4736}, before{H5869} all the Jews{H3064} that sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}."
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I charged{H6680}{(H8762)} Baruch{H1263} before{H5869} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,32,14,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Take{H3947}{(H8800)} these evidences{H5612}, this evidence{H5612} of the purchase{H4736}, both which is sealed{H2856}{(H8803)}, and this evidence{H5612} which is open{H1540}{(H8803)}; and put{H5414}{(H8804)} them in an earthen{H2789} vessel{H3627}, that they may continue{H5975}{(H8799)} many{H7227} days{H3117}."

Jeremiah,32,30,"For the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} and the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063} have only done{H6213}{(H8802)} evil{H7451} before{H5869} me from their youth{H5271}: for the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} have only provoked me to anger{H3707}{(H8688)} with the work{H4639} of their hands{H3027}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,32,31,"For this city{H5892} hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger{H639} and of my fury{H2534} from the day{H3117} that they built{H1129}{(H8804)} it even unto this day{H3117}; that I should remove{H5493}{(H8687)} it from before my face{H6440},"
Jeremiah,32,32,"Because of all the evil{H7451} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} and of the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063}, which they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} to provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}, they, their kings{H4428}, their princes{H8269}, their priests{H3548}, and their prophets{H5030}, and the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, and the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,32,33,"And they have turned{H6437}{(H8799)} unto me the back{H6203}, and not the face{H6440}: though I taught{H3925}{(H8763)} them, rising up early{H7925}{(H8687)} and teaching{H3925}{(H8763)} them, yet they have not hearkened{H8085}{(H8802)} to receive{H3947}{(H8800)} instruction{H4148}."
Jeremiah,32,34,"But they set{H7760}{(H8799)} their abominations{H8251} in the house{H1004}, which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}, to defile{H2930}{(H8763)} it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"And they built{H1129}{(H8799)} the high places{H1116} of Baal{H1168}, which are in the valley{H1516} of the son{H1121} of Hinnom{H2011}, to cause their sons{H1121} and their daughters{H1323} to pass{H5674}{(H8687)} through the fire unto Molech{H4432}; which I commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} them not, neither came{H5927}{(H8804)} it into my mind{H3820}, that they should do{H6213}{(H8800)} this abomination{H8441}, to cause Judah{H3063} to sin{H2398}{(H8687)}."

Jeremiah,32,40,"And I will make{H3772}{(H8804)} an everlasting{H5769} covenant{H1285} with them, that I will not turn away{H7725}{(H8799)} from them{H310}, to do them good{H3190}{(H8687)}; but I will put{H5414}{(H8799)} my fear{H3374} in their hearts{H3824}, that they shall not depart{H5493}{(H8800)} from me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"Yea, I will rejoice{H7797}{(H8804)} over them to do them good{H2895}{(H8687)}, and I will plant{H5193}{(H8804)} them in this land{H776} assuredly{H571} with my whole heart{H3820} and with my whole soul{H5315}."
Jeremiah,32,42,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Like as I have brought{H935}{(H8689)} all this great{H1419} evil{H7451} upon this people{H5971}, so will I bring{H935}{(H8688)} upon them all the good{H2896} that I have promised{H1696}{(H8802)} them."

Jeremiah,33,24,"Considerest{H7200}{(H8804)} thou not what this people{H5971} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The two{H8147} families{H4940} which the LORD{H3068} hath chosen{H977}{(H8804)}, he hath even cast them off{H3988}{(H8799)}? thus they have despised{H5006}{(H8799)} my people{H5971}, that they should be no more a nation{H1471} before{H6440} them."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; If my covenant{H1285} be not with day{H3119} and night{H3915}, and if I have not appointed{H7760}{(H8804)} the ordinances{H2708} of heaven{H8064} and earth{H776};"
Jeremiah,33,26,"Then{H1571} will I cast away{H3988}{(H8799)} the seed{H2233} of Jacob{H3290}, and David{H1732} my servant{H5650}, so that I will not take{H3947}{(H8800)} any of his seed{H2233} to be rulers{H4910}{(H8802)} over the seed{H2233} of Abraham{H85}, Isaac{H3446}, and Jacob{H3290}: for I will cause their captivity{H7622} to return{H7725}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H7725}{(H8799)}, and have mercy{H7355}{(H8765)} on them."
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word{H1697} which came unto Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, when Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and all his army{H2428}, and all the kingdoms{H4467} of the earth{H776} of his dominion{H3027}{H4475}, and all the people{H5971}, fought{H3898}{(H8737)} against Jerusalem{H3389}, and against all the cities{H5892} thereof, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,34,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Go{H1980}{(H8800)} and speak{H559}{(H8804)} to Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and tell{H559}{(H8804)} him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, I will give{H5414}{(H8802)} this city{H5892} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and he shall burn{H8313}{(H8804)} it with fire{H784}:"
Jeremiah,34,3,"And thou shalt not escape out{H4422}{(H8735)} of his hand{H3027}, but shalt surely{H8610}{(H8800)} be taken{H8610}{(H8735)}, and delivered{H5414}{(H8735)} into his hand{H3027}; and thine eyes{H5869} shall behold{H7200}{(H8799)} the eyes{H5869} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and he shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} with thee mouth{H6310} to mouth{H6310}, and thou shalt go{H935}{(H8799)} to Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, O Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of thee, Thou shalt not die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}:"
Jeremiah,34,5,"But thou shalt die{H4191}{(H8799)} in peace{H7965}: and with the burnings{H4955} of thy fathers{H1}, the former{H7223} kings{H4428} which were before{H6440} thee, so shall they burn{H8313}{(H8799)} odours for thee; and they will lament{H5594}{(H8799)} thee, saying, Ah{H1945} lord{H113}! for I have pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} the word{H1697}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,34,6,"Then Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} spake{H1696}{(H8762)} all these words{H1697} unto Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} in Jerusalem{H3389},"
Jeremiah,34,7,"When the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} army{H2428} fought{H3898}{(H8737)} against Jerusalem{H3389}, and against all the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} that were left{H3498}{(H8737)}, against Lachish{H3923}, and against Azekah{H5825}: for these defenced{H4013} cities{H5892} remained{H7604}{(H8738)} of the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}."
Jeremiah,34,8,"This is the word{H1697} that came unto Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, after{H310} that the king{H4428} Zedekiah{H6667} had made{H3772}{(H8800)} a covenant{H1285} with all the people{H5971} which were at Jerusalem{H3389}, to proclaim{H7121}{(H8800)} liberty{H1865} unto them;"
Jeremiah,34,9,"That every man{H376} should let his manservant{H5650}, and every man{H376} his maidservant{H8198}, being an Hebrew{H5680} or an Hebrewess{H5680}, go{H7971}{(H8763)} free{H2670}; that none should serve{H5647}{(H8800)} himself of them, to wit, of a Jew{H3064} his brother{H251}."
Jeremiah,34,10,"Now when all the princes{H8269}, and all the people{H5971}, which had entered{H935}{(H8804)} into the covenant{H1285}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that every one{H376} should let his manservant{H5650}, and every one{H376} his maidservant{H8198}, go{H7971}{(H8763)} free{H2670}, that none should serve{H5647}{(H8800)} themselves of them any more, then they obeyed{H8085}{(H8799)}, and let them go{H7971}{(H8762)}."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward{H310} they turned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and caused the servants{H5650} and the handmaids{H8198}, whom they had let go{H7971}{(H8765)} free{H2670}, to return{H7725}{(H8686)}, and brought them into subjection{H3533}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H3533}{(H8686)} for servants{H5650} and for handmaids{H8198}."
Jeremiah,34,12,"Therefore the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,34,13,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; I made{H3772}{(H8804)} a covenant{H1285} with your fathers{H1} in the day{H3117} that I brought them forth{H3318}{(H8687)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, out of the house{H1004} of bondmen{H5650}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,34,14,"At the end{H7093} of seven{H7651} years{H8141} let ye go{H7971}{(H8762)} every man{H376} his brother{H251} an Hebrew{H5680}, which hath been sold{H4376}{(H8735)} unto thee; and when he hath served{H5647}{(H8804)} thee six{H8337} years{H8141}, thou shalt let him go{H7971}{(H8765)} free{H2670} from thee: but your fathers{H1} hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not unto me, neither inclined{H5186}{(H8689)} their ear{H241}."
Jeremiah,34,15,"And ye were now{H3117} turned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and had done{H6213}{(H8799)} right{H3477} in my sight{H5869}, in proclaiming{H7121}{(H8800)} liberty{H1865} every man{H376} to his neighbour{H7453}; and ye had made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} before{H6440} me in the house{H1004} which is called{H7121}{(H8738)} by my name{H8034}:"
Jeremiah,34,16,"But ye turned{H7725}{(H8799)} and polluted{H2490}{(H8762)} my name{H8034}, and caused every man{H376} his servant{H5650}, and every man{H376} his handmaid{H8198}, whom ye had set{H7971}{(H8765)} at liberty{H2670} at their pleasure{H5315}, to return{H7725}{(H8686)}, and brought them into subjection{H3533}{(H8799)}, to be unto you for servants{H5650} and for handmaids{H8198}."
Jeremiah,34,17,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Ye have not hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto me, in proclaiming{H7121}{(H8800)} liberty{H1865}, every one{H376} to his brother{H251}, and every man{H376} to his neighbour{H7453}: behold, I proclaim{H7121}{(H8802)} a liberty{H1865} for you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, to the sword{H2719}, to the pestilence{H1698}, and to the famine{H7458}; and I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} you to be removed{H2189}{(H8675)}{H2113} into all the kingdoms{H4467} of the earth{H776}."

Jeremiah,34,19,"The princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063}, and the princes{H8269} of Jerusalem{H3389}, the eunuchs{H5631}, and the priests{H3548}, and all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, which passed{H5674}{(H8802)} between the parts{H1335} of the calf{H5695};"
Jeremiah,34,20,"I will even give{H5414}{(H8804)} them into the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}, and into the hand{H3027} of them that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} their life{H5315}: and their dead bodies{H5038} shall be for meat{H3978} unto the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064}, and to the beasts{H929} of the earth{H776}."

Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah{H3414} called{H7121}{(H8799)} Baruch{H1263} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374}: and Baruch{H1263} wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} from the mouth{H6310} of Jeremiah{H3414} all the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he had spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} unto him, upon a roll{H4039} of a book{H5612}."
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Jeremiah{H3414} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Baruch{H1263}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I am shut up{H6113}{(H8803)}; I cannot{H3201}{(H8799)} go{H935}{(H8800)} into the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Jeremiah,36,6,"Therefore go{H935}{(H8804)} thou, and read{H7121}{(H8804)} in the roll{H4039}, which thou hast written{H3789}{(H8804)} from my mouth{H6310}, the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} in the ears{H241} of the people{H5971} in the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004} upon the fasting{H6685} day{H3117}: and also thou shalt read{H7121}{(H8799)} them in the ears{H241} of all Judah{H3063} that come out{H935}{(H8802)} of their cities{H5892}."
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be they will present{H5307}{(H8799)} their supplication{H8467} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and will return{H7725}{(H8799)} every one{H376} from his evil{H7451} way{H1870}: for great{H1419} is the anger{H639} and the fury{H2534} that the LORD{H3068} hath pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} against this people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,36,8,"And Baruch{H1263} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374} did{H6213}{(H8799)} according to all that Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} him, reading{H7121}{(H8800)} in the book{H5612} the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} in the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}."
Jeremiah,36,9,"And it came to pass in the fifth{H2549} year{H8141} of Jehoiakim{H3079} the son{H1121} of Josiah{H2977} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, in the ninth{H8671} month{H2320}, that they proclaimed{H7121}{(H8804)} a fast{H6685} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} to all the people{H5971} in Jerusalem{H3389}, and to all the people{H5971} that came{H935}{(H8802)} from the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} unto Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then read{H7121}{(H8799)} Baruch{H1263} in the book{H5612} the words{H1697} of Jeremiah{H3414} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, in the chamber{H3957} of Gemariah{H1587} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, in the higher{H5945} court{H2691}, at the entry{H6607} of the new{H2319} gate{H8179} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}, in the ears{H241} of all the people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Michaiah{H4321} the son{H1121} of Gemariah{H1587}, the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227}, had heard{H8085}{(H8799)} out of the book{H5612} all the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068},"
Jeremiah,36,12,"Then he went down{H3381}{(H8799)} into the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, into the scribe's{H5608}{(H8802)} chamber{H3957}: and, lo, all the princes{H8269} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} there, even Elishama{H476} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, and Delaiah{H1806} the son{H1121} of Shemaiah{H8098}, and Elnathan{H494} the son{H1121} of Achbor{H5907}, and Gemariah{H1587} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227}, and Zedekiah{H6667} the son{H1121} of Hananiah{H2608}, and all the princes{H8269}."
Jeremiah,36,13,"Then Michaiah{H4321} declared{H5046}{(H8686)} unto them all the words{H1697} that he had heard{H8085}{(H8804)}, when Baruch{H1263} read{H7121}{(H8800)} the book{H5612} in the ears{H241} of the people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,36,14,"Therefore all the princes{H8269} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Jehudi{H3065} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418}, the son{H1121} of Shelemiah{H8018}, the son{H1121} of Cushi{H3570}, unto Baruch{H1263}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} in thine hand{H3027} the roll{H4039} wherein thou hast read{H7121}{(H8804)} in the ears{H241} of the people{H5971}, and come{H3212}{(H8798)}. So Baruch{H1263} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the roll{H4039} in his hand{H3027}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} unto them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Sit down{H3427}{(H8798)} now, and read{H7121}{(H8798)} it in our ears{H241}. So Baruch{H1263} read{H7121}{(H8799)} it in their ears{H241}."
Jeremiah,36,16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard{H8085}{(H8800)} all the words{H1697}, they were afraid{H6342}{(H8804)} both{H413} one{H376} and other{H7453}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Baruch{H1263}, We will surely{H5046}{(H8687)} tell{H5046}{(H8686)} the king{H4428} of all these words{H1697}."
Jeremiah,36,17,"And they asked{H7592}{(H8804)} Baruch{H1263}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Tell{H5046}{(H8685)} us now, How didst thou write{H3789}{(H8804)} all these words{H1697} at his mouth{H6310}?"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Then Baruch{H1263} answered{H559}{(H8799)} them, He pronounced{H7121}{(H8799)} all these words{H1697} unto me with his mouth{H6310}, and I wrote{H3789}{(H8802)} them with ink{H1773} in the book{H5612}."
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the princes{H8269} unto Baruch{H1263}, Go{H3212}{(H8798)}, hide{H5641}{(H8734)} thee, thou and Jeremiah{H3414}; and let no man{H376} know{H3045}{(H8799)} where{H375} ye be."
Jeremiah,36,20,"And they went in{H935}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} into the court{H2691}, but they laid up{H6485}{(H8689)} the roll{H4039} in the chamber{H3957} of Elishama{H476} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, and told{H5046}{(H8686)} all the words{H1697} in the ears{H241} of the king{H4428}."
Jeremiah,36,21,"So the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Jehudi{H3065} to fetch{H3947}{(H8800)} the roll{H4039}: and he took{H3947}{(H8799)} it out of Elishama{H476} the scribe's{H5608}{(H8802)} chamber{H3957}. And Jehudi{H3065} read{H7121}{(H8799)} it in the ears{H241} of the king{H4428}, and in the ears{H241} of all the princes{H8269} which stood{H5975}{(H8802)} beside{H5921} the king{H4428}."
Jeremiah,36,22,Now the king{H4428} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in the winterhouse{H1004}{H2779} in the ninth{H8671} month{H2320}: and there was a fire on the hearth{H254} burning{H1197}{(H8794)} before{H6440} him.
Jeremiah,36,23,"And it came to pass, that when Jehudi{H3065} had read{H7121}{(H8800)} three{H7969} or four{H702} leaves{H1817}, he cut{H7167}{(H8799)} it with the penknife{H8593}{H5608}{(H8802)}, and cast{H7993}{(H8687)} it into the fire{H784} that was on the hearth{H254}, until all the roll{H4039} was consumed{H8552}{(H8800)} in the fire{H784} that was on the hearth{H254}."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid{H6342}{(H8804)}, nor rent{H7167}{(H8804)} their garments{H899}, neither the king{H4428}, nor any of his servants{H5650} that heard{H8085}{(H8802)} all these words{H1697}."
Jeremiah,36,25,Nevertheless Elnathan{H494} and Delaiah{H1806} and Gemariah{H1587} had made intercession{H6293}{(H8689)} to the king{H4428} that he would not burn{H8313}{(H8800)} the roll{H4039}: but he would not hear{H8085}{(H8804)} them.
Jeremiah,36,26,"But the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Jerahmeel{H3396} the son{H1121} of Hammelech{H4429}, and Seraiah{H8304} the son{H1121} of Azriel{H5837}, and Shelemiah{H8018} the son{H1121} of Abdeel{H5655}, to take{H3947}{(H8800)} Baruch{H1263} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)} and Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}: but the LORD{H3068} hid{H5641}{(H8686)} them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Then the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Jeremiah{H3414}, after{H310} that the king{H4428} had burned{H8313}{(H8800)} the roll{H4039}, and the words{H1697} which Baruch{H1263} wrote{H3789}{(H8804)} at the mouth{H6310} of Jeremiah{H3414}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,36,28,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} thee again{H7725}{(H8798)} another{H312} roll{H4039}, and write{H3789}{(H8798)} in it all the former{H7223} words{H1697} that were in the first{H7223} roll{H4039}, which Jehoiakim{H3079} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} hath burned{H8313}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,36,29,"And thou shalt say{H559}{(H8799)} to Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Thou hast burned{H8313}{(H8804)} this roll{H4039}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Why hast thou written{H3789}{(H8804)} therein, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} shall certainly{H935}{(H8800)} come{H935}{(H8799)} and destroy{H7843}{(H8689)} this land{H776}, and shall cause to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} from thence man{H120} and beast{H929}?"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}; He shall have none to sit{H3427}{(H8802)} upon the throne{H3678} of David{H1732}: and his dead body{H5038} shall be cast out{H7993}{(H8716)} in the day{H3117} to the heat{H2721}, and in the night{H3915} to the frost{H7140}."
Jeremiah,36,31,"And I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} him and his seed{H2233} and his servants{H5650} for their iniquity{H5771}; and I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} upon them, and upon the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and upon the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, all the evil{H7451} that I have pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} against them; but they hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not."
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then took{H3947}{(H8804)} Jeremiah{H3414} another{H312} roll{H4039}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} it to Baruch{H1263} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374}; who wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} therein from the mouth{H6310} of Jeremiah{H3414} all the words{H1697} of the book{H5612} which Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} had burned{H8313}{(H8804)} in the fire{H784}: and there were added{H3254}{(H8738)} besides unto them many{H7227} like{H1992} words{H1697}."
Jeremiah,37,1,"And king{H4428} Zedekiah{H6667} the son{H1121} of Josiah{H2977} reigned{H4427}{(H8799)} instead of Coniah{H3659} the son{H1121} of Jehoiakim{H3079}, whom Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} made king{H4427}{(H8689)} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}."
Jeremiah,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants{H5650}, nor the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, did hearken{H8085}{(H8804)} unto the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} by{H3027} the prophet{H5030} Jeremiah{H3414}."
Jeremiah,37,3,"And Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)} Jehucal{H3081} the son{H1121} of Shelemiah{H8018} and Zephaniah{H6846} the son{H1121} of Maaseiah{H4641} the priest{H3548} to the prophet{H5030} Jeremiah{H3414}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Pray{H6419}{(H8690)} now unto the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} for us."
Jeremiah,37,4,Now Jeremiah{H3414} came in{H935}{(H8804)} and went out{H3318}{(H8802)} among{H8432} the people{H5971}: for they had not put{H5414}{(H8804)} him into prison{H1004}{H3628}.
Jeremiah,37,5,"Then Pharaoh's{H6547} army{H2428} was come forth{H3318}{(H8804)} out of Egypt{H4714}: and when the Chaldeans{H3778} that besieged{H6696}{(H8802)} Jerusalem{H3389} heard{H8085}{(H8799)} tidings{H8088} of them, they departed{H5927}{(H8735)} from Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto the prophet{H5030} Jeremiah{H3414}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,37,7,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Thus shall ye say{H559}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, that sent{H7971}{(H8802)} you unto me to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of me; Behold, Pharaoh's{H6547} army{H2428}, which is come forth{H3318}{(H8802)} to help{H5833} you, shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} to Egypt{H4714} into their own land{H776}."
Jeremiah,37,8,"And the Chaldeans{H3778} shall come again{H7725}{(H8804)}, and fight{H3898}{(H8738)} against this city{H5892}, and take{H3920}{(H8804)} it, and burn{H8313}{(H8804)} it with fire{H784}."
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Deceive{H5377}{(H8686)} not yourselves{H5315}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The Chaldeans{H3778} shall surely{H1980}{(H8800)} depart{H3212}{(H8799)} from us: for they shall not depart{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For though ye had smitten{H5221}{(H8689)} the whole army{H2428} of the Chaldeans{H3778} that fight{H3898}{(H8737)} against you, and there remained{H7604}{(H8738)} but wounded{H1856}{(H8794)} men{H582} among them, yet should they rise up{H6965}{(H8799)} every man{H376} in his tent{H168}, and burn{H8313}{(H8804)} this city{H5892} with fire{H784}."
Jeremiah,37,11,"And it came to pass, that when the army{H2428} of the Chaldeans{H3778} was broken up{H5927}{(H8736)} from Jerusalem{H3389} for fear{H6440} of Pharaoh's{H6547} army{H2428},"
Jeremiah,37,12,"Then Jeremiah{H3414} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of Jerusalem{H3389} to go{H3212}{(H8800)} into the land{H776} of Benjamin{H1144}, to separate{H2505}{(H8687)} himself thence in the midst{H8432} of the people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,37,13,"And when he was in the gate{H8179} of Benjamin{H1144}, a captain{H1167} of the ward{H6488} was there, whose name{H8034} was Irijah{H3376}, the son{H1121} of Shelemiah{H8018}, the son{H1121} of Hananiah{H2608}; and he took{H8610}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thou fallest away{H5307}{(H8802)} to the Chaldeans{H3778}."
Jeremiah,37,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414}, It is false{H8267}; I fall not away{H5307}{(H8802)} to the Chaldeans{H3778}. But he hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not to him: so Irijah{H3376} took{H8610}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to the princes{H8269}."
Jeremiah,37,15,"Wherefore the princes{H8269} were wroth{H7107}{(H8799)} with Jeremiah{H3414}, and smote{H5221}{(H8689)} him, and put{H5414}{(H8804)} him in prison{H612} in the house{H1004} of Jonathan{H3083} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}: for they had made{H6213}{(H8804)} that the prison{H3608}."
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Jeremiah{H3414} was entered{H935}{(H8804)} into the dungeon{H1004}{H953}, and into the cabins{H2588}, and Jeremiah{H3414} had remained{H3427}{(H8799)} there many{H7227} days{H3117};"
Jeremiah,37,17,"Then Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and took him out{H3947}{(H8799)}: and the king{H4428} asked{H7592}{(H8799)} him secretly{H5643} in his house{H1004}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Is there any word{H1697} from the LORD{H3068}? And Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)}, There is{H3426}: for, said{H559}{(H8799)} he, thou shalt be delivered{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto king{H4428} Zedekiah{H6667}, What have I offended{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee, or against thy servants{H5650}, or against this people{H5971}, that ye have put{H5414}{(H8804)} me in prison{H1004}{H3608}?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where are now{H346} your prophets{H5030} which prophesied{H5012}{(H8738)} unto you, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} shall not come{H935}{(H8799)} against you, nor against this land{H776}?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Therefore hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now, I pray thee, O my lord{H113} the king{H4428}: let my supplication{H8467}, I pray thee, be accepted{H5307}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee; that thou cause me not to return{H7725}{(H8686)} to the house{H1004} of Jonathan{H3083} the scribe{H5608}{(H8802)}, lest I die{H4191}{(H8799)} there."
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} that they should commit{H6485}{(H8686)} Jeremiah{H3414} into the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}, and that they should give{H5414}{(H8800)} him daily{H3117} a piece{H3603} of bread{H3899} out of the bakers{H644}{(H8802)}' street{H2351}, until all the bread{H3899} in the city{H5892} were spent{H8552}{(H8800)}. Thus Jeremiah{H3414} remained{H3427}{(H8799)} in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Then Shephatiah{H8203} the son{H1121} of Mattan{H4977}, and Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Pashur{H6583}, and Jucal{H3116} the son{H1121} of Shelemiah{H8018}, and Pashur{H6583} the son{H1121} of Malchiah{H4441}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the words{H1697} that Jeremiah{H3414} had spoken{H1696}{(H8764)} unto all the people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,38,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, He that remaineth{H3427}{(H8802)} in this city{H5892} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, by the famine{H7458}, and by the pestilence{H1698}: but he that goeth forth{H3318}{(H8802)} to the Chaldeans{H3778} shall live{H2421}{(H8804)}; for he shall have his life{H5315} for a prey{H7998}, and shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H2425}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, This city{H5892} shall surely{H5414}{(H8736)} be given{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} army{H2428}, which shall take{H3920}{(H8804)} it."
Jeremiah,38,4,"Therefore the princes{H8269} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428}, We beseech thee, let this man{H376} be put to death{H4191}{(H8714)}: for thus{H3651} he weakeneth{H7503}{(H8764)} the hands{H3027} of the men{H582} of war{H4421} that remain{H7604}{(H8737)} in this city{H5892}, and the hands{H3027} of all the people{H5971}, in speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} such words{H1697} unto them: for this man{H376} seeketh{H1875}{(H8802)} not the welfare{H7965} of this people{H5971}, but the hurt{H7451}."
Jeremiah,38,5,"Then Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, he is in your hand{H3027}: for the king{H4428} is not he that can{H3201}{(H8799)} do any thing{H1697} against you."
Jeremiah,38,6,"Then took{H3947}{(H8799)} they Jeremiah{H3414}, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} him into the dungeon{H953} of Malchiah{H4441} the son{H1121} of Hammelech{H4428}, that was in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}: and they let down{H7971}{(H8762)} Jeremiah{H3414} with cords{H2256}. And in the dungeon{H953} there was no water{H4325}, but mire{H2916}: so Jeremiah{H3414} sunk{H2883}{(H8799)} in the mire{H2916}."
Jeremiah,38,7,"Now when Ebedmelech{H5663} the Ethiopian{H3569}, one{H376} of the eunuchs{H5631} which was in the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that they had put{H5414}{(H8804)} Jeremiah{H3414} in the dungeon{H953}; the king{H4428} then sitting{H3427}{(H8802)} in the gate{H8179} of Benjamin{H1144};"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebedmelech{H5663} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} to the king{H4428}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,38,9,"My lord{H113} the king{H4428}, these men{H582} have done evil{H7489}{(H8689)} in all that they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} to Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}, whom they have cast{H7993}{(H8689)} into the dungeon{H953}; and he is like to die{H4191}{(H8799)} for{H6440} hunger{H7458} in the place{H8478} where he is: for there is no more bread{H3899} in the city{H5892}."
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king{H4428} commanded{H6680}{(H8762)} Ebedmelech{H5663} the Ethiopian{H3569}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} from hence thirty{H7970} men{H582} with thee{H3027}, and take up{H5927}{(H8689)} Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} out of the dungeon{H953}, before he die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebedmelech{H5663} took{H3947}{(H8799)} the men{H582} with him{H3027}, and went{H935}{(H8799)} into the house{H1004} of the king{H4428} under the treasury{H214}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} thence old{H1094} cast clouts{H5499} and old{H1094} rotten rags{H4418}, and let them down{H7971}{(H8762)} by cords{H2256} into the dungeon{H953} to Jeremiah{H3414}."
Jeremiah,38,12,"And Ebedmelech{H5663} the Ethiopian{H3569} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, Put{H7760}{(H8798)} now these old{H1094} cast clouts{H5499} and rotten rags{H4418} under thine armholes{H679}{H3027} under the cords{H2256}. And Jeremiah{H3414} did{H6213}{(H8799)} so."
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they drew up{H4900}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} with cords{H2256}, and took him up{H5927}{(H8686)} out of the dungeon{H953}: and Jeremiah{H3414} remained{H3427}{(H8799)} in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}."
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} unto him into the third{H7992} entry{H3996} that is in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: and the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, I will ask{H7592}{(H8802)} thee a thing{H1697}; hide{H3582}{(H8762)} nothing from me."
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Zedekiah{H6667}, If I declare{H5046}{(H8686)} it unto thee, wilt thou not surely{H4191}{(H8687)} put me to death{H4191}{(H8686)}? and if I give thee counsel{H3289}{(H8799)}, wilt thou not hearken{H8085}{(H8799)} unto me?"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} secretly{H5643} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, As the LORD{H3068} liveth{H2416}, that made{H6213}{(H8804)} us this soul{H5315}, I will not put thee to death{H4191}{(H8686)}, neither will I give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee into the hand{H3027} of these men{H582} that seek{H1245}{(H8764)} thy life{H5315}."
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} unto Zedekiah{H6667}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; If thou wilt assuredly{H3318}{(H8800)} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} unto the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} princes{H8269}, then thy soul{H5315} shall live{H2421}{(H8804)}, and this city{H5892} shall not be burned{H8313}{(H8735)} with fire{H784}; and thou shalt live{H2421}{(H8804)}, and thine house{H1004}:"
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if thou wilt not go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} to the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} princes{H8269}, then shall this city{H5892} be given{H5414}{(H8738)} into the hand{H3027} of the Chaldeans{H3778}, and they shall burn{H8313}{(H8804)} it with fire{H784}, and thou shalt not escape out{H4422}{(H8735)} of their hand{H3027}."
Jeremiah,38,19,"And Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, I am afraid{H1672}{(H8802)} of the Jews{H3064} that are fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} to the Chaldeans{H3778}, lest they deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} me into their hand{H3027}, and they mock{H5953}{(H8694)} me."
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)}, They shall not deliver{H5414}{(H8799)} thee. Obey{H8085}{(H8798)}, I beseech thee, the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, which I speak{H1696}{(H8802)} unto thee: so it shall be well{H3190}{(H8799)} unto thee, and thy soul{H5315} shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if thou refuse{H3986} to go forth{H3318}{(H8800)}, this is the word{H1697} that the LORD{H3068} hath shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"And, behold, all the women{H802} that are left{H7604}{(H8738)} in the king{H4428} of Judah's{H3063} house{H1004} shall be brought forth{H3318}{(H8716)} to the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} princes{H8269}, and those women shall say{H559}{(H8802)}, Thy friends{H582}{H7965} have set thee on{H5496}{(H8689)}, and have prevailed{H3201}{(H8804)} against thee: thy feet{H7272} are sunk{H2883}{(H8717)} in the mire{H1206}, and they are turned away{H5472}{(H8738)} back{H268}."
Jeremiah,38,23,"So they shall bring out{H3318}{(H8688)} all thy wives{H802} and thy children{H1121} to the Chaldeans{H3778}: and thou shalt not escape out{H4422}{(H8735)} of their hand{H3027}, but shalt be taken{H8610}{(H8735)} by the hand{H3027} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}: and thou shalt cause this city{H5892} to be burned{H8313}{(H8799)} with fire{H784}."
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Zedekiah{H6667} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, Let no man{H376} know{H3045}{(H8799)} of these words{H1697}, and thou shalt not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the princes{H8269} hear{H8085}{(H8799)} that I have talked{H1696}{(H8765)} with thee, and they come{H935}{(H8804)} unto thee, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, Declare{H5046}{(H8685)} unto us now what thou hast said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto the king{H4428}, hide{H3582}{(H8762)} it not from us, and we will not put thee to death{H4191}{(H8686)}; also what the king{H4428} said{H1696}{(H8765)} unto thee:"
Jeremiah,38,26,"Then thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, I presented{H5307}{(H8688)} my supplication{H8467} before{H6440} the king{H4428}, that he would not cause me to return{H7725}{(H8687)} to Jonathan's{H3083} house{H1004}, to die{H4191}{(H8800)} there."
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} all the princes{H8269} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, and asked{H7592}{(H8799)} him: and he told{H5046}{(H8686)} them according to all these words{H1697} that the king{H4428} had commanded{H6680}{(H8765)}. So they left off speaking{H2790}{(H8686)} with him; for the matter{H1697} was not perceived{H8085}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah{H3414} abode{H3427}{(H8799)} in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307} until the day{H3117} that Jerusalem{H3389} was taken{H3920}{(H8738)}: and he was there when Jerusalem{H3389} was taken{H3920}{(H8738)}.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth{H8671} year{H8141} of Zedekiah{H6667} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, in the tenth{H6224} month{H2320}, came{H935}{(H8804)} Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} and all his army{H2428} against Jerusalem{H3389}, and they besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"And in the eleventh{H6249}{H6240} year{H8141} of Zedekiah{H6667}, in the fourth{H7243} month{H2320}, the ninth{H8672} day of the month{H2320}, the city{H5892} was broken up{H1234}{(H8717)}."
Jeremiah,39,3,"And all the princes{H8269} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came in{H935}{(H8799)}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} in the middle{H8432} gate{H8179}, even Nergalsharezer{H5371}, Samgarnebo{H5562}, Sarsechim{H8310}, Rabsaris{H7249}, Nergalsharezer{H5371}, Rabmag{H7248}, with all the residue{H7611} of the princes{H8269} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,39,4,"And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} saw{H7200}{(H8804)} them, and all the men{H582} of war{H4421}, then they fled{H1272}{(H8799)}, and went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of the city{H5892} by night{H3915}, by the way{H1870} of the king's{H4428} garden{H1588}, by the gate{H8179} betwixt the two walls{H2346}: and he went out{H3318}{(H8799)} the way{H1870} of the plain{H6160}."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the Chaldeans{H3778}' army{H2428} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} them, and overtook{H5381}{(H8686)} Zedekiah{H6667} in the plains{H6160} of Jericho{H3405}: and when they had taken{H3947}{(H8799)} him, they brought him up{H5927}{(H8686)} to Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} to Riblah{H7247} in the land{H776} of Hamath{H2574}, where he gave{H1696}{(H8762)} judgment{H4941} upon him."
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} slew{H7819}{(H8799)} the sons{H1121} of Zedekiah{H6667} in Riblah{H7247} before his eyes{H5869}: also the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} slew{H7819}{(H8804)} all the nobles{H2715} of Judah{H3063}.
Jeremiah,39,7,"Moreover he put out{H5786}{(H8765)} Zedekiah's{H6667} eyes{H5869}, and bound{H631}{(H8799)} him with chains{H5178}, to carry{H935}{(H8687)} him to Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,39,8,"And the Chaldeans{H3778} burned{H8313}{(H8804)} the king's{H4428} house{H1004}, and the houses{H1004} of the people{H5971}, with fire{H784}, and brake down{H5422}{(H8804)} the walls{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)} into Babylon{H894} the remnant{H3499} of the people{H5971} that remained{H7604}{(H8737)} in the city{H5892}, and those that fell away{H5307}{(H8802)}, that fell{H5307}{(H8804)} to him, with the rest{H3499} of the people{H5971} that remained{H7604}{(H8737)}."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} left{H7604}{(H8689)} of the poor{H1800} of the people{H5971}, which had nothing{H3972}, in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them vineyards{H3754} and fields{H3010} at the same time{H3117}."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} gave charge{H6680}{(H8762)} concerning Jeremiah{H3414} to{H3027} Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,39,12,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} him, and look well{H5869}{H7760}{(H8798)} to him, and do{H6213}{(H8799)} him no harm{H3972}{H7451}; but do{H6213}{(H8798)} unto him even as he shall say{H1696}{(H8762)} unto thee."
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and Nebushasban{H5021}, Rabsaris{H7249}, and Nergalsharezer{H5371}, Rabmag{H7248}, and all the king{H4428} of Babylon's{H894} princes{H7227};"
Jeremiah,39,14,"Even they sent{H7971}{(H8799)}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} out of the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}, and committed{H5414}{(H8799)} him unto Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227}, that he should carry{H3318}{(H8687)} him home{H1004}: so he dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} among{H8432} the people{H5971}."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Jeremiah{H3414}, while he was shut up{H6113}{(H8803)} in the court{H2691} of the prison{H4307}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,39,16,"Go{H1980}{(H8800)} and speak{H559}{(H8804)} to Ebedmelech{H5663} the Ethiopian{H3569}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} my words{H1697} upon this city{H5892} for evil{H7451}, and not for good{H2896}; and they shall be accomplished in that day{H3117} before{H6440} thee."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} thee in that day{H3117}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}: and thou shalt not be given{H5414}{(H8735)} into the hand{H3027} of the men{H582} of whom{H6440} thou art afraid{H3016}{(H8801)}."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely{H4422}{(H8763)} deliver{H4422}{(H8762)} thee, and thou shalt not fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, but thy life{H5315} shall be for a prey{H7998} unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust{H982}{(H8804)} in me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word{H1697} that came to Jeremiah{H3414} from the LORD{H3068}, after{H310} that Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} had let him go{H7971}{(H8763)} from Ramah{H7414}, when he had taken{H3947}{(H8800)} him being bound{H631}{(H8803)} in chains{H246} among{H8432} all that were carried away captive{H1546} of Jerusalem{H3389} and Judah{H3063}, which were carried away captive{H1540}{(H8716)} unto Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,40,2,"And the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414}, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, The LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} hath pronounced{H1696}{(H8765)} this evil{H7451} upon this place{H4725}."
Jeremiah,40,3,"Now the LORD{H3068} hath brought{H935}{(H8686)} it, and done{H6213}{(H8799)} according as he hath said{H1696}{(H8765)}: because ye have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}, and have not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} his voice{H6963}, therefore this thing{H1697} is come upon you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"And now, behold, I loose{H6605}{(H8765)} thee this day{H3117} from the chains{H246} which were upon thine hand{H3027}. If it seem good{H2896}{H5869} unto thee to come{H935}{(H8800)} with me into Babylon{H894}, come{H935}{(H8798)}; and I will look well{H7760}{(H8799)}{H5869} unto thee: but if it seem ill{H7489}{(H8804)}{H5869} unto thee to come{H935}{(H8800)} with me into Babylon{H894}, forbear{H2308}{(H8798)}: behold{H7200}{(H8798)}, all the land{H776} is before{H6440} thee: whither it seemeth{H413} good{H2896} and convenient{H3477}{H5869} for thee to go{H3212}{(H8800)}, thither go{H3212}{(H8798)}."
Jeremiah,40,5,"Now while he was not yet gone back{H7725}{(H8799)}, he said, Go back{H7725}{(H8798)} also to Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227}, whom the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} hath made governor{H6485}{(H8689)} over the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and dwell{H3427}{(H8798)} with him among{H8432} the people{H5971}: or go{H3212}{(H8798)} wheresoever it seemeth convenient{H3477}{H5869} unto thee to go{H3212}{(H8800)}. So the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} him victuals{H737} and a reward{H4864}, and let him go{H7971}{(H8762)}."
Jeremiah,40,6,Then went{H935}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414} unto Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} to Mizpah{H4708}; and dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} with him among{H8432} the people{H5971} that were left{H7604}{(H8737)} in the land{H776}.
Jeremiah,40,7,"Now when all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428} which were in the fields{H7704}, even they and their men{H582}, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} that the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} had made Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} governor{H6485}{(H8689)} in the land{H776}, and had committed{H6485}{(H8689)} unto him men{H582}, and women{H802}, and children{H2945}, and of the poor{H1803} of the land{H776}, of them that were not carried away captive{H1540}{(H8717)} to Babylon{H894};"
Jeremiah,40,8,"Then they came{H935}{(H8799)} to Gedaliah{H1436} to Mizpah{H4708}, even Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418}, and Johanan{H3110} and Jonathan{H3129} the sons{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and Seraiah{H8304} the son{H1121} of Tanhumeth{H8576}, and the sons{H1121} of Ephai{H5778} the Netophathite{H5200}, and Jezaniah{H3153} the son{H1121} of a Maachathite{H4602}, they and their men{H582}."
Jeremiah,40,9,"And Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227} sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto them and to their men{H582}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Fear{H3372}{(H8799)} not to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} the Chaldeans{H3778}: dwell in{H3427}{(H8798)} the land{H776}, and serve{H5647}{(H8798)} the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and it shall be well{H3190}{(H8799)} with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} at Mizpah{H4709} to serve{H5975}{(H8800)}{H6440} the Chaldeans{H3778}, which will come{H935}{(H8799)} unto us: but ye, gather{H622}{(H8798)} ye wine{H3196}, and summer fruits{H7019}, and oil{H8081}, and put{H7760}{(H8798)} them in your vessels{H3627}, and dwell{H3427}{(H8798)} in your cities{H5892} that ye have taken{H8610}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews{H3064} that were in Moab{H4124}, and among the Ammonites{H5983}, and in Edom{H123}, and that were in all the countries{H776}, heard{H8085}{(H8804)} that the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} had left{H5414}{(H8804)} a remnant{H7611} of Judah{H3063}, and that he had set{H6485}{(H8689)} over them Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227};"
Jeremiah,40,12,"Even all the Jews{H3064} returned out{H7725}{(H8799)} of all places{H4725} whither they were driven{H5080}{(H8738)}, and came{H935}{(H8799)} to the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}, to Gedaliah{H1436}, unto Mizpah{H4708}, and gathered{H622}{(H8799)} wine{H3196} and summer fruits{H7019} very{H3966} much{H7235}{(H8687)}."
Jeremiah,40,13,"Moreover Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428} that were in the fields{H7704}, came{H935}{(H8804)} to Gedaliah{H1436} to Mizpah{H4708},"
Jeremiah,40,14,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Dost thou certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} know{H3045}{(H8799)} that Baalis{H1185} the king{H4428} of the Ammonites{H1121}{H5983} hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} to slay{H5221}{(H8687)}{H5315} thee? But Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} believed{H539}{(H8689)} them not."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143} spake{H559}{(H8804)} to Gedaliah{H1436} in Mizpah{H4709} secretly{H5643}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Let me go{H3212}{(H8799)}, I pray thee, and I will slay{H5221}{(H8686)} Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418}, and no man{H376} shall know{H3045}{(H8799)} it: wherefore should he slay{H5221}{(H8686)}{H5315} thee, that all the Jews{H3064} which are gathered{H6908}{(H8737)} unto thee should be scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}, and the remnant{H7611} in Judah{H3063} perish{H6}{(H8804)}?"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, Thou shalt not do{H6213}{(H8799)} this thing{H1697}: for thou speakest{H1696}{(H8802)} falsely{H8267} of Ishmael{H3458}."
Jeremiah,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh{H7637} month{H2320}, that Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} the son{H1121} of Elishama{H476}, of the seed{H2233} royal{H4410}, and the princes{H7227} of the king{H4428}, even ten{H6235} men{H582} with him, came{H935}{(H8804)} unto Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} to Mizpah{H4709}; and there they did eat{H398}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} together{H3162} in Mizpah{H4708}."
Jeremiah,41,2,"Then arose{H6965}{(H8799)} Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418}, and the ten{H6235} men{H582} that were with him, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227} with the sword{H2719}, and slew{H4191}{(H8686)} him, whom the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} had made governor{H6485}{(H8689)} over the land{H776}."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael{H3458} also slew{H5221}{(H8689)} all the Jews{H3064} that were with him, even with Gedaliah{H1436}, at Mizpah{H4709}, and the Chaldeans{H3778} that were found{H4672}{(H8738)} there, and the men{H582} of war{H4421}."
Jeremiah,41,4,"And it came to pass the second{H8145} day{H3117} after he had slain{H4191}{(H8687)} Gedaliah{H1436}, and no man{H376} knew{H3045}{(H8804)} it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"That there came{H935}{(H8799)} certain{H582} from Shechem{H7927}, from Shiloh{H7887}, and from Samaria{H8111}, even fourscore{H8084} men{H376}, having their beards{H2206} shaven{H1548}{(H8794)}, and their clothes{H899} rent{H7167}{(H8803)}, and having cut{H1413}{(H8706)} themselves, with offerings{H4503} and incense{H3828} in their hand{H3027}, to bring{H935}{(H8687)} them to the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,41,6,"And Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} from Mizpah{H4709} to meet{H7125}{(H8800)} them, weeping{H1058}{(H8802)} all along{H1980}{(H8800)} as he went{H1980}{(H8802)}: and it came to pass, as he met{H6298}{(H8800)} them, he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Come{H935}{(H8798)} to Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296}."
Jeremiah,41,7,"And it was so, when they came{H935}{(H8800)} into the midst{H8432} of the city{H5892}, that Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} slew{H7819}{(H8799)} them, and cast them into the midst{H8432} of the pit{H953}, he, and the men{H582} that were with him."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten{H6235} men{H582} were found{H4672}{(H8738)} among them that said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ishmael{H3458}, Slay{H4191}{(H8686)} us not: for we have{H3426} treasures{H4301} in the field{H7704}, of wheat{H2406}, and of barley{H8184}, and of oil{H8081}, and of honey{H1706}. So he forbare{H2308}{(H8799)}, and slew{H4191}{(H8689)} them not among{H8432} their brethren{H251}."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now the pit{H953} wherein Ishmael{H3458} had cast{H7993}{(H8689)} all the dead bodies{H6297} of the men{H582}, whom he had slain{H5221}{(H8689)} because{H3027} of Gedaliah{H1436}, was it which Asa{H609} the king{H4428} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} for fear{H6440} of Baasha{H1201} king{H4428} of Israel{H3478}: and Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} filled{H4390}{(H8765)} it with them that were slain{H2491}."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael{H3458} carried away captive{H7617}{(H8799)} all the residue{H7611} of the people{H5971} that were in Mizpah{H4709}, even the king's{H4428} daughters{H1323}, and all the people{H5971} that remained{H7604}{(H8737)} in Mizpah{H4709}, whom Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} had committed{H6485}{(H8689)} to Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296}: and Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} carried them away captive{H7617}{(H8799)}, and departed{H3212}{(H8799)} to go over{H5674}{(H8800)} to the Ammonites{H1121}{H5983}."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428} that were with him, heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of all the evil{H7451} that Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} had done{H6213}{(H8804)},"
Jeremiah,41,12,"Then they took{H3947}{(H8799)} all the men{H582}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to fight{H3898}{(H8736)} with Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418}, and found{H4672}{(H8799)} him by the great{H7227} waters{H4325} that are in Gibeon{H1391}."
Jeremiah,41,13,"Now it came to pass, that when all the people{H5971} which were with Ishmael{H3458} saw{H7200}{(H8800)} Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428} that were with him, then they were glad{H8055}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people{H5971} that Ishmael{H3458} had carried away captive{H7617}{(H8804)} from Mizpah{H4709} cast about{H5437}{(H8799)} and returned{H7725}{(H8799)}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} unto Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}."
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} escaped{H4422}{(H8738)} from{H6440} Johanan{H3110} with eight{H8083} men{H582}, and went{H3212}{(H8799)} to the Ammonites{H1121}{H5983}."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then took{H3947}{(H8799)} Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428} that were with him, all the remnant{H7611} of the people{H5971} whom he had recovered{H7725}{(H8689)} from Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418}, from Mizpah{H4709}, after{H310} that he had slain{H5221}{(H8689)} Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296}, even mighty{H1397} men{H582} of war{H4421}, and the women{H802}, and the children{H2945}, and the eunuchs{H5631}, whom he had brought again{H7725}{(H8689)} from Gibeon{H1391}:"
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they departed{H3212}{(H8799)}, and dwelt in{H3427}{(H8799)} the habitation{H1628} of Chimham{H3643}, which is by{H681} Bethlehem{H1035}, to go{H3212}{(H8800)} to enter{H935}{(H8800)} into Egypt{H4714},"
Jeremiah,41,18,"Because{H6440} of the Chaldeans{H3778}: for they were afraid{H3372}{(H8804)} of them, because Ishmael{H3458} the son{H1121} of Nethaniah{H5418} had slain{H5221}{(H8689)} Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296}, whom the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} made governor{H6485}{(H8689)} in the land{H776}."

Jeremiah,42,2,"And said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication{H8467} be accepted{H5307}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee, and pray{H6419}{(H8690)} for us unto the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430}, even for all this remnant{H7611};(for we are left{H7604}{(H8738)} but a few{H4592} of many{H7235}{(H8687)}, as thine eyes{H5869} do behold{H7200}{(H8802)} us:)"
Jeremiah,42,3,"That the LORD{H3068} thy God{H430} may shew{H5046}{(H8686)} us the way{H1870} wherein we may walk{H3212}{(H8799)}, and the thing{H1697} that we may do{H6213}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} you; behold, I will pray{H6419}{(H8693)} unto the LORD{H3068} your God{H430} according to your words{H1697}; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing{H1697} the LORD{H3068} shall answer{H6030}{(H8799)} you, I will declare{H5046}{(H8686)} it unto you; I will keep{H4513} nothing{H1697} back{H4513}{(H8799)} from you."

Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it be good{H2896}, or whether it be evil{H7451}, we will obey{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, to whom we{H580} send{H7971}{(H8802)} thee; that it may be well{H3190}{(H8799)} with us, when we obey{H8085}{(H8799)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Jeremiah,42,7,"And it came to pass after{H7093} ten{H6235} days{H3117}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto Jeremiah{H3414}."

Jeremiah,42,13,"But if ye say{H559}{(H8802)}, We will not dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} in this land{H776}, neither obey{H8085}{(H8800)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430},"
Jeremiah,42,14,"Saying{H559}{(H8800)}, No; but we will go{H935}{(H8799)} into the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, where we shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} no war{H4421}, nor hear{H8085}{(H8799)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, nor have hunger{H7456}{(H8799)} of bread{H3899}; and there will we dwell{H3427}{(H8799)}:"
Jeremiah,42,15,"And now therefore hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}, ye remnant{H7611} of Judah{H3063}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; If ye wholly{H7760}{(H8800)} set{H7760}{(H8799)} your faces{H6440} to enter{H935}{(H8800)} into Egypt{H4714}, and go{H935}{(H8804)} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} there;"
Jeremiah,42,16,"Then it shall come to pass, that the sword{H2719}, which ye feared{H3373}, shall overtake{H5381}{(H8686)} you there in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and the famine{H7458}, whereof ye were afraid{H1672}{(H8802)}, shall follow close{H1692}{(H8799)} after{H310} you there in Egypt{H4714}; and there ye shall die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men{H582} that set{H7760}{(H8804)} their faces{H6440} to go{H935}{(H8800)} into Egypt{H4714} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} there; they shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, by the famine{H7458}, and by the pestilence{H1698}: and none of them shall remain{H8300} or escape{H6412} from{H6440} the evil{H7451} that I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} upon them."
Jeremiah,42,18,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; As mine anger{H639} and my fury{H2534} hath been poured forth{H5413}{(H8738)} upon the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}; so shall my fury{H2534} be poured forth{H5413}{(H8799)} upon you, when ye shall enter{H935}{(H8800)} into Egypt{H4714}: and ye shall be an execration{H423}, and an astonishment{H8047}, and a curse{H7045}, and a reproach{H2781}; and ye shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} this place{H4725} no more."
Jeremiah,42,19,"The LORD{H3068} hath said{H1696}{(H8765)} concerning you, O ye remnant{H7611} of Judah{H3063}; Go{H935}{(H8799)} ye not into Egypt{H4714}: know{H3045}{(H8799)} certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} that I have admonished{H5749}{(H8689)} you this day{H3117}."
Jeremiah,42,20,"For ye dissembled{H8582}{(H8689)} in your hearts{H5315}, when ye sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me unto the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Pray{H6419}{(H8690)} for us unto the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}; and according unto all that the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} shall say{H559}{(H8799)}, so declare{H5046}{(H8685)} unto us, and we will do{H6213}{(H8804)} it."
Jeremiah,42,21,"And now I have this day{H3117} declared{H5046}{(H8686)} it to you; but ye have not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}, nor any thing for the which he hath sent{H7971}{(H8804)} me unto you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore know{H3045}{(H8799)} certainly{H3045}{(H8800)} that ye shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, by the famine{H7458}, and by the pestilence{H1698}, in the place{H4725} whither ye desire{H2654}{(H8804)} to go{H935}{(H8800)} and to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)}."
Jeremiah,43,1,"And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah{H3414} had made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} unto all the people{H5971} all the words{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, for which the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} had sent{H7971}{(H8804)} him to them, even all these words{H1697},"
Jeremiah,43,2,"Then spake{H559}{(H8799)} Azariah{H5838} the son{H1121} of Hoshaiah{H1955}, and Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the proud{H2086} men{H582}, saying{H559}{(H8802)} unto Jeremiah{H3414}, Thou speakest{H1696}{(H8764)} falsely{H8267}: the LORD{H3068} our God{H430} hath not sent{H7971}{(H8804)} thee to say{H559}{(H8800)}, Go{H935}{(H8799)} not into Egypt{H4714} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} there:"
Jeremiah,43,3,"But Baruch{H1263} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374} setteth thee on{H5496}{(H8688)} against us, for to{H4616} deliver{H5414}{(H8800)} us into the hand{H3027} of the Chaldeans{H3778}, that they might put us to death{H4191}{(H8687)}, and carry us away captives{H1540}{(H8687)} into Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428}, and all the people{H5971}, obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}."
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Johanan{H3110} the son{H1121} of Kareah{H7143}, and all the captains{H8269} of the forces{H2428}, took{H3947}{(H8799)} all the remnant{H7611} of Judah{H3063}, that were returned{H7725}{(H8804)} from all nations{H1471}, whither they had been driven{H5080}{(H8738)}, to dwell{H1481}{(H8800)} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063};"
Jeremiah,43,6,"Even men{H1397}, and women{H802}, and children{H2945}, and the king's{H4428} daughters{H1323}, and every person{H5315} that Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} had left{H3240}{(H8689)} with Gedaliah{H1436} the son{H1121} of Ahikam{H296} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227}, and Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}, and Baruch{H1263} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374}."
Jeremiah,43,7,So they came{H935}{(H8799)} into the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}: for they obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} not the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}: thus came{H935}{(H8799)} they even to Tahpanhes{H8471}.
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto Jeremiah{H3414} in Tahpanhes{H8471}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,43,9,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} great{H1419} stones{H68} in thine hand{H3027}, and hide{H2934}{(H8804)} them in the clay{H4423} in the brickkiln{H4404}, which is at the entry{H6607} of Pharaoh's{H6547} house{H1004} in Tahpanhes{H8471}, in the sight{H5869} of the men{H582} of Judah{H3064};"
Jeremiah,43,10,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will send{H7971}{(H8802)} and take{H3947}{(H8804)} Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, my servant{H5650}, and will set{H7760}{(H8804)} his throne{H3678} upon{H4605} these stones{H68} that I have hid{H2934}{(H8804)}; and he shall spread{H5186}{(H8804)} his royal pavilion{H8237} over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"And when he cometh{H935}{(H8804)}, he shall smite{H5221}{(H8689)} the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and deliver such as are for death{H4194} to death{H4194}; and such as are for captivity{H7628} to captivity{H7628}; and such as are for the sword{H2719} to the sword{H2719}."
Jeremiah,43,12,"And I will kindle{H3341}{(H8689)} a fire{H784} in the houses{H1004} of the gods{H430} of Egypt{H4714}; and he shall burn{H8313}{(H8804)} them, and carry them away captives{H7617}{(H8804)}: and he shall array{H5844}{(H8804)} himself with the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, as a shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)} putteth on{H5844}{(H8799)} his garment{H899}; and he shall go forth{H3318}{(H8804)} from thence in peace{H7965}."
Jeremiah,43,13,"He shall break{H7665}{(H8765)} also the images{H4676} of Bethshemesh{H1053}, that is in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}; and the houses{H1004} of the gods{H430} of the Egyptians{H4714} shall he burn{H8313}{(H8799)} with fire{H784}."
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word{H1697} that came to Jeremiah{H3414} concerning all the Jews{H3064} which dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, which dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} at Migdol{H4024}, and at Tahpanhes{H8471}, and at Noph{H5297}, and in the country{H776} of Pathros{H6624}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,44,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Ye have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} all the evil{H7451} that I have brought{H935}{(H8689)} upon Jerusalem{H3389}, and upon all the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}; and, behold, this day{H3117} they are a desolation{H2723}, and no man dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} therein,"
Jeremiah,44,3,"Because{H6440} of their wickedness{H7451} which they have committed{H6213}{(H8804)} to provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}, in that they went{H3212}{(H8800)} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8763)}, and to serve{H5647}{(H8800)} other{H312} gods{H430}, whom they knew{H3045}{(H8804)} not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers{H1}."
Jeremiah,44,4,"Howbeit I sent{H7971}{(H8799)} unto you all my servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, rising early{H7925}{(H8687)} and sending{H7971}{(H8800)} them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Oh, do{H6213}{(H8799)} not this abominable{H8441} thing{H1697} that I hate{H8130}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} not, nor inclined{H5186}{(H8689)} their ear{H241} to turn{H7725}{(H8800)} from their wickedness{H7451}, to burn no incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto other{H312} gods{H430}."
Jeremiah,44,6,"Wherefore my fury{H2534} and mine anger{H639} was poured forth{H5413}{(H8799)}, and was kindled{H1197}{(H8799)} in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063} and in the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}; and they are wasted{H2723} and desolate{H8077}, as at this day{H3117}."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Therefore now thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Wherefore commit{H6213}{(H8802)} ye this great{H1419} evil{H7451} against your souls{H5315}, to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} from you man{H376} and woman{H802}, child{H5768} and suckling{H3243}{(H8802)}, out{H8432} of Judah{H3063}, to leave{H3498}{(H8687)} you none to remain{H7611};"
Jeremiah,44,8,"In that ye provoke me unto wrath{H3707}{(H8687)} with the works{H4639} of your hands{H3027}, burning incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto other{H312} gods{H430} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, whither ye be gone{H935}{(H8802)} to dwell{H1481}{(H8800)}, that ye might cut yourselves off{H3772}{(H8687)}, and that ye might be a curse{H7045} and a reproach{H2781} among all the nations{H1471} of the earth{H776}?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have ye forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} the wickedness{H7451} of your fathers{H1}, and the wickedness{H7451} of the kings{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and the wickedness{H7451} of their wives{H802}, and your own wickedness{H7451}, and the wickedness{H7451} of your wives{H802}, which they have committed{H6213}{(H8804)} in the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}, and in the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"They are not humbled{H1792}{(H8795)} even unto this day{H3117}, neither have they feared{H3372}{(H8804)}, nor walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in my law{H8451}, nor in my statutes{H2708}, that I set{H5414}{(H8804)} before{H6440} you and before{H6440} your fathers{H1}."
Jeremiah,44,11,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}; Behold, I will set{H7760}{(H8802)} my face{H6440} against you for evil{H7451}, and to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} all Judah{H3063}."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take{H3947}{(H8804)} the remnant{H7611} of Judah{H3063}, that have set{H7760}{(H8804)} their faces{H6440} to go{H935}{(H8800)} into the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} there, and they shall all be consumed{H8552}{(H8804)}, and fall{H5307}{(H8799)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}; they shall even be consumed{H8552}{(H8735)} by the sword{H2719} and by the famine{H7458}: they shall die{H4191}{(H8799)}, from the least{H6996} even unto the greatest{H1419}, by the sword{H2719} and by the famine{H7458}: and they shall be an execration{H423}, and an astonishment{H8047}, and a curse{H7045}, and a reproach{H2781}."
Jeremiah,44,13,"For I will punish{H6485}{(H8804)} them that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, as I have punished{H6485}{(H8804)} Jerusalem{H3389}, by the sword{H2719}, by the famine{H7458}, and by the pestilence{H1698}:"
Jeremiah,44,14,"So that none of the remnant{H7611} of Judah{H3063}, which are gone{H935}{(H8802)} into the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} to sojourn{H1481}{(H8800)} there, shall escape{H6412} or remain{H8300}, that they should return{H7725}{(H8800)} into the land{H776} of Judah{H3063}, to the which they have{H5375}{(H8764)} a desire{H5315} to return{H7725}{(H8800)} to dwell{H3427}{(H8800)} there: for none shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} but such as shall escape{H6405}."
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men{H582} which knew{H3045}{(H8802)} that their wives{H802} had burned incense{H6999}{(H8764)} unto other{H312} gods{H430}, and all the women{H802} that stood by{H5975}{(H8802)}, a great{H1419} multitude{H6951}, even all the people{H5971} that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, in Pathros{H6624}, answered{H6030}{(H8799)} Jeremiah{H3414}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,44,16,"As for the word{H1697} that thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} unto us in the name{H8034} of the LORD{H3068}, we will not hearken{H8085}{(H8802)} unto thee."
Jeremiah,44,17,"But we will certainly{H6213}{(H8800)} do{H6213}{(H8799)} whatsoever thing{H1697} goeth forth{H3318}{(H8804)} out of our own mouth{H6310}, to burn incense{H6999}{(H8763)} unto the queen{H4446} of heaven{H8064}, and to pour out{H5258}{(H8687)} drink offerings{H5262} unto her, as we have done{H6213}{(H8804)}, we, and our fathers{H1}, our kings{H4428}, and our princes{H8269}, in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and in the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}: for then had we plenty{H7646}{(H8799)} of victuals{H3899}, and were well{H2896}, and saw{H7200}{(H8804)} no evil{H7451}."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we left off{H2308}{(H8804)} to burn incense{H6999}{(H8763)} to the queen{H4446} of heaven{H8064}, and to pour out{H5258}{(H8687)} drink offerings{H5262} unto her, we have wanted{H2637}{(H8804)} all things, and have been consumed{H8552}{(H8804)} by the sword{H2719} and by the famine{H7458}."
Jeremiah,44,19,"And when we burned incense{H6999}{(H8764)} to the queen{H4446} of heaven{H8064}, and poured out{H5258}{(H8687)} drink offerings{H5262} unto her, did we make{H6213}{(H8804)} her cakes{H3561} to worship{H6087}{(H8687)} her, and pour out{H5258}{(H8687)} drink offerings{H5262} unto her, without{H1107} our men{H582}?"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto all the people{H5971}, to the men{H1397}, and to the women{H802}, and to all the people{H5971} which had given him that answer{H1697}{H6030}{(H8802)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Jeremiah,44,21,"The incense{H7002} that ye burned{H6999}{(H8765)} in the cities{H5892} of Judah{H3063}, and in the streets{H2351} of Jerusalem{H3389}, ye, and your fathers{H1}, your kings{H4428}, and your princes{H8269}, and the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, did not the LORD{H3068} remember{H2142}{(H8804)} them, and came{H5927}{(H8799)} it not into his mind{H3820}?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"So that the LORD{H3068} could{H3201}{(H8799)} no longer bear{H5375}{(H8800)}, because{H6440} of the evil{H7455} of your doings{H4611}, and because{H6440} of the abominations{H8441} which ye have committed{H6213}{(H8804)}; therefore is your land{H776} a desolation{H2723}, and an astonishment{H8047}, and a curse{H7045}, without an inhabitant{H3427}{(H8802)}, as at this day{H3117}."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because{H6440}{H834} ye have burned incense{H6999}{(H8765)}, and because ye have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against the LORD{H3068}, and have not obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068}, nor walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in his law{H8451}, nor in his statutes{H2708}, nor in his testimonies{H5715}; therefore this evil{H7451} is happened{H7122}{(H8804)} unto you, as at this day{H3117}."

Jeremiah,48,9,"Give{H5414}{(H8798)} wings{H6731} unto Moab{H4124}, that it may flee{H5323}{(H8800)} and get away{H3318}{(H8799)}: for the cities{H5892} thereof shall be desolate{H8047}, without any to dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein{H2004}."
Jeremiah,48,10,"Cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be he that doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} the work{H4399} of the LORD{H3068} deceitfully{H7423}, and cursed{H779}{(H8803)} be he that keepeth back{H4513}{(H8802)} his sword{H2719} from blood{H1818}."
Jeremiah,48,11,"Moab{H4124} hath been at ease{H7599}{(H8768)} from his youth{H5271}, and he hath settled{H8252}{(H8802)} on his lees{H8105}, and hath not been emptied{H7324}{(H8717)} from vessel{H3627} to vessel{H3627}, neither hath he gone{H1980}{(H8804)} into captivity{H1473}: therefore his taste{H2940} remained{H5975}{(H8804)} in him, and his scent{H7381} is not changed{H4171}{(H8738)}."
Jeremiah,48,12,"Therefore, behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will send{H7971}{(H8765)} unto him wanderers{H6808}{(H8802)}, that shall cause him to wander{H6808}{(H8765)}, and shall empty{H7324}{(H8686)} his vessels{H3627}, and break{H5310}{(H8762)} their bottles{H5035}."
Jeremiah,48,13,"And Moab{H4124} shall be ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} of Chemosh{H3645}, as the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} was ashamed{H954}{(H8804)} of Bethel{H1008} their confidence{H4009}."
Jeremiah,48,14,"How say{H559}{(H8799)} ye, We are mighty{H1368} and strong{H2428} men{H582} for the war{H4421}?"

Jeremiah,48,26,"Make ye him drunken{H7937}{(H8685)}: for he magnified{H1431}{(H8689)} himself against the LORD{H3068}: Moab{H4124} also shall wallow{H5606}{(H8804)} in his vomit{H6892}, and he also shall be in derision{H7814}."
Jeremiah,48,27,"For was not Israel{H3478} a derision{H7814} unto thee? was he found{H4672}{(H8738)} among thieves{H1590}? for since{H1767} thou spakest{H1697} of him, thou skippedst{H5110}{(H8709)} for joy."
Jeremiah,48,28,"O ye that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in Moab{H4124}, leave{H5800}{(H8798)} the cities{H5892}, and dwell{H7931}{(H8798)} in the rock{H5553}, and be like the dove{H3123} that maketh her nest{H7077}{(H8762)} in the sides{H5676} of the hole's{H6354} mouth{H6310}."

Jeremiah,48,36,"Therefore mine heart{H3820} shall sound{H1993}{(H8799)} for Moab{H4124} like pipes{H2485}, and mine heart{H3820} shall sound{H1993}{(H8799)} like pipes{H2485} for the men{H582} of Kirheres{H7025}: because the riches{H3502} that he hath gotten{H6213}{(H8804)} are perished{H6}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,48,37,"For every head{H7218} shall be bald{H7144}, and every beard{H2206} clipped{H1639}{(H8803)}: upon all the hands{H3027} shall be cuttings{H1417}, and upon the loins{H4975} sackcloth{H8242}."
Jeremiah,48,38,"There shall be lamentation{H4553} generally upon all the housetops{H1406} of Moab{H4124}, and in the streets{H7339} thereof: for I have broken{H7665}{(H8804)} Moab{H4124} like a vessel{H3627} wherein is no pleasure{H2656}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,48,39,"They shall howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, saying, How is it broken down{H2865}{(H8804)}! how hath Moab{H4124} turned{H6437}{(H8689)} the back{H6203} with shame{H954}{(H8804)}! so shall Moab{H4124} be a derision{H7814} and a dismaying{H4288} to all them about{H5439} him."
Jeremiah,48,40,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, he shall fly{H1675}{(H8799)} as an eagle{H5404}, and shall spread{H6566}{(H8804)} his wings{H3671} over Moab{H4124}."

Jeremiah,49,1,"Concerning the Ammonites{H1121}{H5983}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Hath Israel{H3478} no sons{H1121}? hath he no heir{H3423}{(H8802)}? why then doth their king{H4428} inherit{H3423}{(H8804)} Gad{H1410}, and his people{H5971} dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} in his cities{H5892}?"

Jeremiah,50,35,"A sword{H2719} is upon the Chaldeans{H3778}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, and upon the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Babylon{H894}, and upon her princes{H8269}, and upon her wise{H2450} men."
Jeremiah,50,36,A sword{H2719} is upon the liars{H907}; and they shall dote{H2973}{(H8738)}: a sword{H2719} is upon her mighty men{H1368}; and they shall be dismayed{H2865}{(H8804)}.
Jeremiah,50,37,"A sword{H2719} is upon their horses{H5483}, and upon their chariots{H7393}, and upon all the mingled people{H6153} that are in the midst{H8432} of her; and they shall become as women{H802}: a sword{H2719} is upon her treasures{H214}; and they shall be robbed{H962}{(H8795)}."
Jeremiah,50,38,"A drought{H2721} is upon her waters{H4325}; and they shall be dried up{H3001}{(H8804)}: for it is the land{H776} of graven images{H6456}, and they are mad{H1984}{(H8704)} upon their idols{H367}."
Jeremiah,50,39,"Therefore the wild beasts of the desert{H6728} with the wild beasts of the islands{H338} shall dwell{H3427}{(H8799)} there, and the owls{H1323}{H3284} shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} therein: and it shall be no more inhabited{H3427}{(H8799)} for ever{H5331}; neither shall it be dwelt{H7931}{(H8799)} in from generation{H1755} to generation{H1755}."
Jeremiah,50,40,"As God{H430} overthrew{H4114} Sodom{H5467} and Gomorrah{H6017} and the neighbour{H7934} cities thereof, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}; so shall no man{H376} abide{H3427}{(H8799)} there, neither shall any son{H1121} of man{H120} dwell{H1481}{(H8799)} therein."
Jeremiah,50,41,"Behold, a people{H5971} shall come{H935}{(H8802)} from the north{H6828}, and a great{H1419} nation{H1471}, and many{H7227} kings{H4428} shall be raised up{H5782}{(H8735)} from the coasts{H3411} of the earth{H776}."
Jeremiah,50,42,"They shall hold{H2388}{(H8686)} the bow{H7198} and the lance{H3591}: they are cruel{H394}, and will not shew mercy{H7355}{(H8762)}: their voice{H6963} shall roar{H1993}{(H8799)} like the sea{H3220}, and they shall ride{H7392}{(H8799)} upon horses{H5483}, every one put in array{H6186}{(H8803)}, like a man{H376} to the battle{H4421}, against thee, O daughter{H1323} of Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,50,43,"The king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} hath heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the report{H8088} of them, and his hands{H3027} waxed feeble{H7503}{(H8804)}: anguish{H6869} took hold{H2388}{(H8689)} of him, and pangs{H2427} as of a woman in travail{H3205}{(H8802)}."
Jeremiah,50,44,"Behold, he shall come up{H5927}{(H8799)} like a lion{H738} from the swelling{H1347} of Jordan{H3383} unto the habitation{H5116} of the strong{H386}: but I will make{H7323} them suddenly{H7280}{(H8686)} run away{H7323}{(H8686)}{(H8675)}{H7323}{(H8799)} from her: and who is a chosen{H977}{(H8803)} man, that I may appoint{H6485}{(H8799)} over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time{H3259}{(H8686)}? and who is that shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)} that will stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me?"
Jeremiah,50,45,"Therefore hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the counsel{H6098} of the LORD{H3068}, that he hath taken{H3289}{(H8804)} against Babylon{H894}; and his purposes{H4284}, that he hath purposed{H2803}{(H8804)} against the land{H776} of the Chaldeans{H3778}: Surely the least{H6810} of the flock{H6629} shall draw them out{H5498}{(H8799)}: surely he shall make their habitation{H5116} desolate{H8074}{(H8686)} with them."
Jeremiah,50,46,"At the noise{H6963} of the taking{H8610}{(H8738)} of Babylon{H894} the earth{H776} is moved{H7493}{(H8735)}, and the cry{H2201} is heard{H8085}{(H8738)} among the nations{H1471}."
Jeremiah,51,1,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, I will raise up{H5782}{(H8688)} against Babylon{H894}, and against them that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} in the midst{H3820} of them that rise up{H6965}{(H8801)} against me, a destroying{H7843}{(H8688)} wind{H7307};"
Jeremiah,51,2,"And will send{H7971}{(H8765)} unto Babylon{H894} fanners{H2114}{(H8801)}, that shall fan{H2219}{(H8765)} her, and shall empty{H1238}{(H8787)} her land{H776}: for in the day{H3117} of trouble{H7451} they shall be against her round about{H5439}."
Jeremiah,51,3,"Against him that bendeth{H1869} let the archer{H1869}{(H8802)} bend{H1869}{(H8799)} his bow{H7198}, and against him that lifteth himself up{H5927}{(H8691)} in his brigandine{H5630}: and spare{H2550}{(H8799)} ye not her young men{H970}; destroy ye utterly{H2763}{(H8685)} all her host{H6635}."
Jeremiah,51,4,"Thus the slain{H2491} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} in the land{H776} of the Chaldeans{H3778}, and they that are thrust through{H1856}{(H8794)} in her streets{H2351}."
Jeremiah,51,5,"For Israel{H3478} hath not been forsaken{H488}, nor Judah{H3063} of his God{H430}, of the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; though their land{H776} was filled{H4390}{(H8804)} with sin{H817} against the Holy One{H6918} of Israel{H3478}."
Jeremiah,51,6,"Flee out{H5127}{(H8798)} of the midst{H8432} of Babylon{H894}, and deliver{H4422}{(H8761)} every man{H376} his soul{H5315}: be not cut off{H1826}{(H8735)} in her iniquity{H5771}; for this is the time{H6256} of the LORD'S{H3068} vengeance{H5360}; he will render{H7999}{(H8764)} unto her a recompence{H1576}."
Jeremiah,51,7,"Babylon{H894} hath been a golden{H2091} cup{H3563} in the LORD'S{H3068} hand{H3027}, that made all the earth{H776} drunken{H7937}{(H8764)}: the nations{H1471} have drunken{H8354}{(H8804)} of her wine{H3196}; therefore the nations{H1471} are mad{H1984}{(H8704)}."
Jeremiah,51,8,"Babylon{H894} is suddenly{H6597} fallen{H5307}{(H8804)} and destroyed{H7665}{(H8735)}: howl{H3213}{(H8685)} for her; take{H3947}{(H8798)} balm{H6875} for her pain{H4341}, if so be she may be healed{H7495}{(H8735)}."
Jeremiah,51,9,"We would have healed{H7495}{(H8765)} Babylon{H894}, but she is not healed{H7495}{(H8738)}: forsake{H5800}{(H8798)} her, and let us go{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} into his own country{H776}: for her judgment{H4941} reacheth{H5060}{(H8804)} unto heaven{H8064}, and is lifted up{H5375}{(H8738)} even to the skies{H7834}."
Jeremiah,51,10,"The LORD{H3068} hath brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} our righteousness{H6666}: come{H935}{(H8798)}, and let us declare{H5608}{(H8762)} in Zion{H6726} the work{H4639} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}."
Jeremiah,51,11,"Make bright{H1305}{(H8685)} the arrows{H2671}; gather{H4390}{(H8798)} the shields{H7982}: the LORD{H3068} hath raised up{H5782}{(H8689)} the spirit{H7307} of the kings{H4428} of the Medes{H4074}: for his device{H4209} is against Babylon{H894}, to destroy{H7843}{(H8687)} it; because it is the vengeance{H5360} of the LORD{H3068}, the vengeance{H5360} of his temple{H1964}."
Jeremiah,51,12,"Set up{H5375}{(H8798)} the standard{H5251} upon the walls{H2346} of Babylon{H894}, make the watch{H4929} strong{H2388}{(H8685)}, set up{H6965}{(H8685)} the watchmen{H8104}{(H8802)}, prepare{H3559}{(H8685)} the ambushes{H693}{(H8802)}: for the LORD{H3068} hath both devised{H2161}{(H8804)} and done{H6213}{(H8804)} that which he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} against the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Babylon{H894}."

Jeremiah,51,16,"When he uttereth{H5414}{(H8800)} his voice{H6963}, there is a multitude{H1995} of waters{H4325} in the heavens{H8064}; and he causeth the vapours{H5387} to ascend{H5927}{(H8686)} from the ends{H7097} of the earth{H776}: he maketh{H6213}{(H8804)} lightnings{H1300} with rain{H4306}, and bringeth forth{H3318}{(H8686)} the wind{H7307} out of his treasures{H214}."
Jeremiah,51,17,"Every man{H120} is brutish{H1197}{(H8738)} by his knowledge{H1847}; every founder{H6884}{(H8802)} is confounded{H3001}{(H8689)} by the graven image{H6459}: for his molten image{H5262} is falsehood{H8267}, and there is no breath{H7307} in them."
Jeremiah,51,18,"They are vanity{H1892}, the work{H4639} of errors{H8595}: in the time{H6256} of their visitation{H6486} they shall perish{H6}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,51,19,The portion{H2506} of Jacob{H3290} is not like them; for he is the former{H3335}{(H8802)} of all things: and Israel is the rod{H7626} of his inheritance{H5159}: the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635} is his name{H8034}.
Jeremiah,51,20,"Thou art my battle axe{H4661} and weapons{H3627} of war{H4421}: for with thee will I break in pieces{H5310}{(H8765)} the nations{H1471}, and with thee will I destroy{H7843}{(H8689)} kingdoms{H4467};"

Jeremiah,51,47,"Therefore, behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, that I will do judgment{H6485}{(H8804)} upon the graven images{H6456} of Babylon{H894}: and her whole land{H776} shall be confounded{H954}{(H8799)}, and all her slain{H2491} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} in the midst{H8432} of her."
Jeremiah,51,48,"Then the heaven{H8064} and the earth{H776}, and all that is therein, shall sing{H7442}{(H8765)} for Babylon{H894}: for the spoilers{H7703}{(H8802)} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} unto her from the north{H6828}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,51,49,"As{H1571} Babylon{H894} hath caused the slain{H2491} of Israel{H3478} to fall{H5307}{(H8800)}, so at Babylon{H894} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} the slain{H2491} of all the earth{H776}."
Jeremiah,51,50,"Ye that have escaped{H6405} the sword{H2719}, go away{H1980}{(H8798)}, stand not still{H5975}{(H8799)}: remember{H2142}{(H8798)} the LORD{H3068} afar off{H7350}, and let Jerusalem{H3389} come{H5927}{(H8799)} into your mind{H3824}."
Jeremiah,51,51,"We are confounded{H954}{(H8804)}, because we have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} reproach{H2781}: shame{H3639} hath covered{H3680}{(H8765)} our faces{H6440}: for strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} are come{H935}{(H8804)} into the sanctuaries{H4720} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}."
Jeremiah,51,52,"Wherefore, behold, the days{H3117} come{H935}{(H8802)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}, that I will do judgment{H6485}{(H8804)} upon her graven images{H6456}: and through all her land{H776} the wounded{H2491} shall groan{H602}{(H8799)}."
Jeremiah,51,53,"Though Babylon{H894} should mount up{H5927}{(H8799)} to heaven{H8064}, and though she should fortify{H1219}{(H8762)} the height{H4791} of her strength{H5797}, yet{H227} from me shall spoilers{H7703}{(H8802)} come{H935}{(H8799)} unto her, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Jeremiah,51,54,"A sound{H6963} of a cry{H2201} cometh from Babylon{H894}, and great{H1419} destruction{H7667} from the land{H776} of the Chaldeans{H3778}:"
Jeremiah,51,55,"Because the LORD{H3068} hath spoiled{H7703}{(H8802)} Babylon{H894}, and destroyed{H6}{(H8765)} out of her the great{H1419} voice{H6963}; when her waves{H1530} do roar{H1993}{(H8804)} like great{H7227} waters{H4325}, a noise{H7588} of their voice{H6963} is uttered{H5414}{(H8738)}:"
Jeremiah,51,56,"Because the spoiler{H7703}{(H8802)} is come{H935}{(H8804)} upon her, even upon Babylon{H894}, and her mighty men{H1368} are taken{H3920}{(H8738)}, every one of their bows{H7198} is broken{H2865}{(H8765)}: for the LORD{H3068} God{H410} of recompences{H1578} shall surely{H7999}{(H8763)} requite{H7999}{(H8762)}."
Jeremiah,51,57,"And I will make drunk{H7937}{(H8689)} her princes{H8269}, and her wise{H2450} men, her captains{H6346}, and her rulers{H5461}, and her mighty men{H1368}: and they shall sleep{H3462}{(H8804)} a perpetual{H5769} sleep{H8142}, and not wake{H6974}{(H8686)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the King{H4428}, whose name{H8034} is the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}."
Jeremiah,51,58,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068} of hosts{H6635}; The broad{H7342} walls{H2346} of Babylon{H894} shall be utterly{H6209}{(H8771)} broken{H6209}{(H8698)}, and her high{H1364} gates{H8179} shall be burned{H3341}{(H8799)} with fire{H784}; and the people{H5971} shall labour{H3021}{(H8799)} in vain{H7385}, and the folk{H3816} in{H1767} the fire{H784}, and they shall be weary{H3286}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,51,59,"The word{H1697} which Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030} commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} Seraiah{H8304} the son{H1121} of Neriah{H5374}, the son{H1121} of Maaseiah{H4271}, when he went{H3212}{(H8800)} with Zedekiah{H6667} the king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} into Babylon{H894} in the fourth{H7243} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)}. And this Seraiah{H8304} was a quiet{H4496} prince{H8269}."
Jeremiah,51,60,"So Jeremiah{H3414} wrote{H3789}{(H8799)} in a{H259} book{H5612} all the evil{H7451} that should come{H935}{(H8799)} upon Babylon{H894}, even all these words{H1697} that are written{H3789}{(H8803)} against Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,51,61,"And Jeremiah{H3414} said{H559}{(H8799)} to Seraiah{H8304}, When thou comest{H935}{(H8800)} to Babylon{H894}, and shalt see{H7200}{(H8804)}, and shalt read{H7121}{(H8804)} all these words{H1697};"
Jeremiah,51,62,"Then shalt thou say{H559}{(H8804)}, O LORD{H3068}, thou hast spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} against this place{H4725}, to cut it off{H3772}{(H8687)}, that none shall remain{H3427}{(H8802)} in it, neither man{H120} nor beast{H929}, but that it shall be desolate{H8077} for ever{H5769}."
Jeremiah,51,63,"And it shall be, when thou hast made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of reading{H7121}{(H8800)} this book{H5612}, that thou shalt bind{H7194}{(H8799)} a stone{H68} to it, and cast{H7993}{(H8689)} it into the midst{H8432} of Euphrates{H6578}:"
Jeremiah,51,64,"And thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus shall Babylon{H894} sink{H8257}{(H8799)}, and shall not rise{H6965}{(H8799)} from{H6440} the evil{H7451} that I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} upon her: and they shall be weary{H3286}{(H8804)}. Thus far are the words{H1697} of Jeremiah{H3414}."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah{H6667} was one{H259} and twenty{H6242} years{H8141} old{H1121} when he began to reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, and he reigned{H4427}{(H8804)} eleven{H259}{H6240} years{H8141} in Jerusalem{H3389}. And his mother's{H517} name{H8034} was Hamutal{H2537} the daughter{H1323} of Jeremiah{H3414} of Libnah{H3841}."
Jeremiah,52,2,"And he did{H6213}{(H8799)} that which was evil{H7451} in the eyes{H5869} of the LORD{H3068}, according to all that Jehoiakim{H3079} had done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,52,3,"For through{H5921} the anger{H639} of the LORD{H3068} it came to pass in Jerusalem{H3389} and Judah{H3063}, till he had cast them out{H7993}{(H8687)} from his presence{H6440}, that Zedekiah{H6667} rebelled{H4775}{(H8799)} against the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,52,4,"And it came to pass in the ninth{H8671} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)}, in the tenth{H6224} month{H2320}, in the tenth{H6218} day of the month{H2320}, that Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} came{H935}{(H8804)}, he and all his army{H2428}, against Jerusalem{H3389}, and pitched{H2583}{(H8799)} against it, and built{H1129}{(H8799)} forts{H1785} against it round about{H5439}."
Jeremiah,52,5,So{H935}{(H8799)} the city{H5892} was besieged{H4692} unto the eleventh{H6249}{H6240} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Zedekiah{H6667}.
Jeremiah,52,6,"And in the fourth{H7243} month{H2320}, in the ninth{H8672} day of the month{H2320}, the famine{H7458} was sore{H2388}{(H8799)} in the city{H5892}, so that there was no bread{H3899} for the people{H5971} of the land{H776}."
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city{H5892} was broken up{H1234}{(H8735)}, and all the men{H582} of war{H4421} fled{H1272}{(H8799)}, and went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of the city{H5892} by night{H3915} by the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} between the two walls{H2346}, which was by the king's{H4428} garden{H1588};(now the Chaldeans{H3778} were by the city{H5892} round about{H5439}:) and they went{H3212}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the plain{H6160}."
Jeremiah,52,8,"But the army{H2428} of the Chaldeans{H3778} pursued{H7291}{(H8799)} after{H310} the king{H4428}, and overtook{H5381}{(H8686)} Zedekiah{H6667} in the plains{H6160} of Jericho{H3405}; and all his army{H2428} was scattered{H6327}{(H8738)} from him."
Jeremiah,52,9,"Then they took{H8610}{(H8799)} the king{H4428}, and carried him up{H5927}{(H8686)} unto the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} to Riblah{H7247} in the land{H776} of Hamath{H2574}; where he gave{H1696}{(H8762)} judgment{H4941} upon him."
Jeremiah,52,10,And the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} slew{H7819}{(H8799)} the sons{H1121} of Zedekiah{H6667} before his eyes{H5869}: he slew{H7819}{(H8804)} also all the princes{H8269} of Judah{H3063} in Riblah{H7247}.
Jeremiah,52,11,"Then he put out{H5786}{(H8765)} the eyes{H5869} of Zedekiah{H6667}; and the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} bound{H631}{(H8799)} him in chains{H5178}, and carried{H935}{(H8686)} him to Babylon{H894}, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} him in prison{H1004}{H6486} till the day{H3117} of his death{H4194}."
Jeremiah,52,12,"Now in the fifth{H2549} month{H2320}, in the tenth{H6218} day of the month{H2320}, which was the nineteenth{H8672}{H6240}{H8141} year{H8141} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, came{H935}{(H8804)} Nebuzaradan{H5018}, captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876}, which served{H5975}{(H8804)}{H6440} the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, into Jerusalem{H3389},"
Jeremiah,52,13,"And burned{H8313}{(H8799)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the king's{H4428} house{H1004}; and all the houses{H1004} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and all the houses{H1004} of the great{H1419} men, burned{H8313}{(H8804)} he with fire{H784}:"
Jeremiah,52,14,"And all the army{H2428} of the Chaldeans{H3778}, that were with the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876}, brake down{H5422}{(H8804)} all the walls{H2346} of Jerusalem{H3389} round about{H5439}."
Jeremiah,52,15,"Then Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)} certain of the poor{H1803} of the people{H5971}, and the residue{H3499} of the people{H5971} that remained{H7604}{(H8737)} in the city{H5892}, and those that fell away{H5307}{(H8802)}, that fell{H5307}{(H8804)} to the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, and the rest{H3499} of the multitude{H527}."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} left{H7604}{(H8689)} certain of the poor{H1803} of the land{H776} for vinedressers{H3755} and for husbandmen{H3009}{(H8802)}.
Jeremiah,52,17,"Also the pillars{H5982} of brass{H5178} that were in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and the bases{H4350}, and the brasen{H5178} sea{H3220} that was in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, the Chaldeans{H3778} brake{H7665}{(H8765)}, and carried{H5375}{(H8799)} all the brass{H5178} of them to Babylon{H894}."
Jeremiah,52,18,"The caldrons{H5518} also, and the shovels{H3257}, and the snuffers{H4212}, and the bowls{H4219}, and the spoons{H3709}, and all the vessels{H3627} of brass{H5178} wherewith they ministered{H8334}{(H8762)}, took they away{H3947}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,52,19,"And the basons{H5592}, and the firepans{H4289}, and the bowls{H4219}, and the caldrons{H5518}, and the candlesticks{H4501}, and the spoons{H3709}, and the cups{H4518}; that which was of gold{H2091} in gold{H2091}, and that which was of silver{H3701} in silver{H3701}, took{H3947} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} away{H3947}{(H8804)}."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two{H8147} pillars{H5982}, one{H259} sea{H3220}, and twelve{H8147}{H6240} brasen{H5178} bulls{H1241} that were under the bases{H4350}, which king{H4428} Solomon{H8010} had made{H6213}{(H8804)} in the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: the brass{H5178} of all these vessels{H3627} was without weight{H4948}."
Jeremiah,52,21,"And concerning the pillars{H5982}, the height{H6967} of one{H259} pillar{H5982} was eighteen{H8083}{H6240} cubits{H520}; and a fillet{H2339} of twelve{H8147}{H6240} cubits{H520} did compass{H5437}{(H8799)} it; and the thickness{H5672} thereof was four{H702} fingers{H676}: it was hollow{H5014}{(H8803)}."
Jeremiah,52,22,"And a chapiter{H3805} of brass{H5178} was upon it; and the height{H6967} of one{H259} chapiter{H3805} was five{H2568} cubits{H520}, with network{H7639} and pomegranates{H7416} upon the chapiters{H3805} round about{H5439}, all of brass{H5178}. The second{H8145} pillar{H5982} also and the pomegranates{H7416} were like unto these."
Jeremiah,52,23,And there were ninety{H8673} and six{H8337} pomegranates{H7416} on a side{H7307}; and all the pomegranates{H7416} upon the network{H7639} were an hundred{H3967} round about{H5439}.
Jeremiah,52,24,"And the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} took{H3947}{(H8799)} Seraiah{H8304} the chief{H7218} priest{H3548}, and Zephaniah{H6846} the second{H4932} priest{H3548}, and the three{H7969} keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the door{H5592}:"
Jeremiah,52,25,"He took{H3947}{(H8804)} also out of the city{H5892} an{H259} eunuch{H5631}, which had the charge{H6496} of the men{H582} of war{H4421}; and seven{H7651} men{H582} of them that were near{H7200}{(H8802)} the king's{H4428} person{H6440}, which were found{H4672}{(H8738)} in the city{H5892}; and the principal{H8269} scribe{H5608}{(H8802)} of the host{H6635}, who mustered{H6633}{(H8688)} the people{H5971} of the land{H776}; and threescore{H8346} men{H376} of the people{H5971} of the land{H776}, that were found{H4672}{(H8737)} in the midst{H8432} of the city{H5892}."
Jeremiah,52,26,"So Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} took{H3947}{(H8799)} them, and brought{H3212}{(H8686)} them to the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} to Riblah{H7247}."
Jeremiah,52,27,"And the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} smote{H5221}{(H8686)} them, and put them to death{H4191}{(H8686)} in Riblah{H7247} in the land{H127} of Hamath{H2574}. Thus Judah{H3063} was carried away captive{H1540}{(H8799)} out of his own land{H776}."
Jeremiah,52,28,This is the people{H5971} whom Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)}: in the seventh{H7651} year{H8141} three{H7969} thousand{H505} Jews{H3064} and three{H7969} and twenty{H6242}:
Jeremiah,52,29,In the eighteenth{H8083}{H6240} year{H8141} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} he carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)} from Jerusalem{H3389} eight{H8083} hundred{H3967} thirty{H7970} and two{H8147} persons{H5315}:
Jeremiah,52,30,In the three{H7969} and twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} Nebuzaradan{H5018} the captain{H7227} of the guard{H2876} carried away captive{H1540}{(H8689)} of the Jews{H3064} seven{H7651} hundred{H3967} forty{H705} and five{H2568} persons{H5315}: all the persons{H5315} were four{H702} thousand{H505} and six{H8337} hundred{H3967}.
Jeremiah,52,31,"And it came to pass in the seven{H7651} and thirtieth{H7970} year{H8141} of the captivity{H1546} of Jehoiachin{H3078} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, in the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} month{H2320}, in the five{H2568} and twentieth{H6242} day of the month{H2320}, that Evilmerodach{H192} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} in the first year{H8141} of his reign{H4438} lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} the head{H7218} of Jehoiachin{H3078} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063}, and brought him forth{H3318}{(H8686)} out of prison{H1004}{H3628},"
Jeremiah,52,32,"And spake{H1696}{(H8762)} kindly{H2896} unto him, and set{H5414}{(H8799)} his throne{H3678} above{H4605} the throne{H3678} of the kings{H4428} that were with him in Babylon{H894},"
Jeremiah,52,33,And changed{H8138}{(H8765)} his prison{H3608} garments{H899}: and he did continually{H8548} eat{H398}{(H8804)} bread{H3899} before{H6440} him all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}.
Jeremiah,52,34,"And for his diet{H737}, there was a continual{H8548} diet{H737} given{H5414}{(H8738)} him of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}, every{H3117} day{H3117} a portion{H1697} until the day{H3117} of his death{H4194}, all the days{H3117} of his life{H2416}."
Lamentations,1,1,"How doth the city{H5892} sit{H3427}{(H8804)} solitary{H910}, that was full{H7227} of people{H5971}! how is she become as a widow{H490}! she that was great{H7227} among the nations{H1471}, and princess{H8282} among the provinces{H4082}, how is she become tributary{H4522}!"

Lamentations,5,17,For this our heart{H3820} is faint{H1739}; for these things our eyes{H5869} are dim{H2821}{(H8804)}.
Lamentations,5,18,"Because of the mountain{H2022} of Zion{H6726}, which is desolate{H8074}{(H8804)}, the foxes{H7776} walk{H1980}{(H8765)} upon it."
Lamentations,5,19,"Thou, O LORD{H3068}, remainest{H3427}{(H8799)} for ever{H5769}; thy throne{H3678} from generation{H1755} to generation{H1755}."
Lamentations,5,20,"Wherefore dost thou forget{H7911}{(H8799)} us for ever{H5331}, and forsake{H5800}{(H8799)} us so long{H753} time{H3117}?"
Lamentations,5,21,"Turn{H7725}{(H8685)} thou us unto thee, O LORD{H3068}, and we shall be turned{H7725}{(H8799)}; renew{H2318}{(H8761)} our days{H3117} as of old{H6924}."
Lamentations,5,22,But thou hast utterly{H3988}{(H8800)} rejected{H3988}{(H8804)} us; thou art very{H3966} wroth{H7107}{(H8804)} against us.
Ezekiel,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth{H7970} year{H8141}, in the fourth{H7243} month, in the fifth{H2568} day of the month{H2320}, as I was among{H8432} the captives{H1473} by the river{H5104} of Chebar{H3529}, that the heavens{H8064} were opened{H6605}{(H8738)}, and I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} visions{H4759} of God{H430}."
Ezekiel,1,2,"In the fifth{H2568} day of the month{H2320}, which was the fifth{H2549} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Jehoiachin's{H3112} captivity{H1546},"
Ezekiel,1,3,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came expressly unto Ezekiel{H3168} the priest{H3548}, the son{H1121} of Buzi{H941}, in the land{H776} of the Chaldeans{H3778} by the river{H5104} Chebar{H3529}; and the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was there upon him."
Ezekiel,1,4,"And I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, a whirlwind{H7307}{H5591} came{H935}{(H8802)} out of the north{H6828}, a great{H1419} cloud{H6051}, and a fire{H784} infolding{H3947}{(H8693)} itself, and a brightness{H5051} was about{H5439} it, and out of the midst{H8432} thereof as the colour{H5869} of amber{H2830}, out of the midst{H8432} of the fire{H784}."
Ezekiel,1,5,Also out of the midst{H8432} thereof came the likeness{H1823} of four{H702} living creatures{H2416}. And this was their appearance{H4758}; they{H2007} had the likeness{H1823} of a man{H120}.
Ezekiel,1,6,"And every one{H259} had four{H702} faces{H6440}, and every one{H259} had four{H702} wings{H3671}."
Ezekiel,1,7,And their feet{H7272} were straight{H3477} feet{H7272}; and the sole{H3709} of their feet{H7272} was like the sole{H3709} of a calf's{H5695} foot{H7272}: and they sparkled{H5340}{(H8802)} like the colour{H5869} of burnished{H7044} brass{H5178}.
Ezekiel,1,8,And they had the hands{H3027} of a man{H120} under their wings{H3671} on their four{H702} sides{H7253}; and they four{H702} had their faces{H6440} and their wings{H3671}.
Ezekiel,1,9,Their wings{H3671} were joined{H2266}{(H8802)} one{H802} to another{H269}; they turned{H5437}{(H8735)} not when they went{H3212}{(H8800)}; they went{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} straight{H5676} forward{H6440}.
Ezekiel,1,10,"As for the likeness{H1823} of their faces{H6440}, they four{H702} had the face{H6440} of a man{H120}, and the face{H6440} of a lion{H738}, on the right side{H3225}: and they four{H702} had the face{H6440} of an ox{H7794} on the left side{H8040}; they four{H702} also had the face{H6440} of an eagle{H5404}."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Thus were their faces{H6440}: and their wings{H3671} were stretched{H6504}{(H8803)} upward{H4605}; two{H8147} wings of every one{H376} were joined{H2266}{(H8802)} one{H376} to another{H376}, and two{H8147} covered{H3680}{(H8764)} their bodies{H1472}."
Ezekiel,1,12,"And they went{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} straight{H5676} forward{H6440}: whither the spirit{H7307} was to go{H3212}{(H8800)}, they went{H3212}{(H8799)}; and they turned{H5437}{(H8735)} not when they went{H3212}{(H8800)}."
Ezekiel,1,13,"As for the likeness{H1823} of the living creatures{H2416}, their appearance{H4758} was like burning{H1197}{(H8802)} coals{H1513} of fire{H784}, and like the appearance{H4758} of lamps{H3940}: it went up and down{H1980}{(H8693)} among the living creatures{H2416}; and the fire{H784} was bright{H5051}, and out of the fire{H784} went forth{H3318}{(H8802)} lightning{H1300}."
Ezekiel,1,14,And the living creatures{H2416} ran{H7519}{(H8800)} and returned{H7725}{(H8800)} as the appearance{H4758} of a flash of lightning{H965}.
Ezekiel,1,15,"Now as I beheld{H7200}{(H8799)} the living creatures{H2416}, behold one{H259} wheel{H212} upon the earth{H776} by{H681} the living creatures{H2416}, with his four{H702} faces{H6440}."
Ezekiel,1,16,The appearance{H4758} of the wheels{H212} and their work{H4639} was like unto the colour{H5869} of a beryl{H8658}: and they four{H702} had one{H259} likeness{H1823}: and their appearance{H4758} and their work{H4639} was as it were a wheel{H212} in the middle{H8432} of a wheel{H212}.
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they went{H3212}{(H8800)}, they went{H3212}{(H8799)} upon their four{H702} sides{H7253}: and they turned{H5437}{(H8735)} not when they went{H3212}{(H8800)}."
Ezekiel,1,18,"As for their rings{H1354}, they were so high{H1363} that they were dreadful{H3374}; and their rings{H1354} were full{H4392} of eyes{H5869} round about{H5439} them four{H702}."
Ezekiel,1,19,"And when the living creatures{H2416} went{H3212}{(H8800)}, the wheels{H212} went{H3212}{(H8799)} by them{H681}: and when the living creatures{H2416} were lifted up{H5375}{(H8736)} from the earth{H776}, the wheels{H212} were lifted up{H5375}{(H8735)}."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Whithersoever the spirit{H7307} was to go{H3212}{(H8800)}, they went{H3212}{(H8799)}, thither was their spirit{H7307} to go{H3212}{(H8800)}; and the wheels{H212} were lifted up{H5375}{(H8735)} over against{H5980} them: for the spirit{H7307} of the living creature{H2416} was in the wheels{H212}."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When those went{H3212}{(H8800)}, these went{H3212}{(H8799)}; and when those stood{H5975}{(H8800)}, these stood{H5975}{(H8799)}; and when those were lifted up{H5375}{(H8736)} from the earth{H776}, the wheels{H212} were lifted up{H5375}{(H8735)} over against{H5980} them: for the spirit{H7307} of the living creature{H2416} was in the wheels{H212}."
Ezekiel,1,22,"And the likeness{H1823} of the firmament{H7549} upon the heads{H7218} of the living creature{H2416} was as the colour{H5869} of the terrible{H3372}{(H8737)} crystal{H7140}, stretched forth{H5186}{(H8803)} over their heads{H7218} above{H4605}."
Ezekiel,1,23,"And under the firmament{H7549} were their wings{H3671} straight{H3477}, the one{H802} toward the other{H269}: every one{H376} had two{H8147}, which covered{H3680}{(H8764)} on this side{H2007}, and every one{H376} had two{H8147}, which covered{H3680}{(H8764)} on that side{H2007}, their bodies{H1472}."
Ezekiel,1,24,"And when they went{H3212}{(H8800)}, I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} the noise{H6963} of their wings{H3671}, like the noise{H6963} of great{H7227} waters{H4325}, as the voice{H6963} of the Almighty{H7706}, the voice{H6963} of speech{H1999}, as the noise{H6963} of an host{H4264}: when they stood{H5975}{(H8800)}, they let down{H7503}{(H8762)} their wings{H3671}."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And there was a voice{H6963} from the firmament{H7549} that was over their heads{H7218}, when they stood{H5975}{(H8800)}, and had let down{H7503}{(H8762)} their wings{H3671}."
Ezekiel,1,26,"And above{H4605} the firmament{H7549} that was over their heads{H7218} was the likeness{H1823} of a throne{H3678}, as the appearance{H4758} of a sapphire{H5601} stone{H68}: and upon the likeness{H1823} of the throne{H3678} was the likeness{H1823} as the appearance{H4758} of a man{H120} above{H4605} upon it."
Ezekiel,1,27,"And I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} as the colour{H5869} of amber{H2830}, as the appearance{H4758} of fire{H784} round about{H5439} within{H1004} it, from the appearance{H4758} of his loins{H4975} even upward{H4605}, and from the appearance{H4758} of his loins{H4975} even downward{H4295}, I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} as it were the appearance{H4758} of fire{H784}, and it had brightness{H5051} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,1,28,"As the appearance{H4758} of the bow{H7198} that is in the cloud{H6051} in the day{H3117} of rain{H1653}, so was the appearance{H4758} of the brightness{H5051} round about{H5439}. This was the appearance{H4758} of the likeness{H1823} of the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068}. And when I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} it, I fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon my face{H6440}, and I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} a voice{H6963} of one that spake{H1696}{(H8764)}."
Ezekiel,2,1,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, stand{H5975}{(H8798)} upon thy feet{H7272}, and I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto thee."
Ezekiel,2,2,"And the spirit{H7307} entered{H935}{(H8799)} into me when he spake{H1696}{(H8765)} unto me, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} me upon my feet{H7272}, that I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} him that spake{H1696}{(H8693)} unto me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, I send{H7971}{(H8802)} thee to the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, to a rebellious{H4775}{(H8802)} nation{H1471} that hath rebelled{H4775}{(H8804)} against me: they and their fathers{H1} have transgressed{H6586}{(H8804)} against me, even unto this very{H6106} day{H3117}."
Ezekiel,2,4,"For they are impudent{H7186}{H6440} children{H1121} and stiffhearted{H2389}{H3820}. I do send{H7971}{(H8802)} thee unto them; and thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear{H8085}{(H8799)}, or whether they will forbear{H2308}{(H8799)},(for they are a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004},) yet shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that there hath been a prophet{H5030} among{H8432} them."
Ezekiel,2,6,"And thou, son{H1121} of man{H120}, be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of them, neither be afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of their words{H1697}, though briers{H5621} and thorns{H5544} be with thee, and thou dost dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} among scorpions{H6137}: be not afraid{H3372}{(H8799)} of their words{H1697}, nor be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)} at their looks{H6440}, though they be a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,2,7,"And thou shalt speak{H1696}{(H8765)} my words{H1697} unto them, whether they will hear{H8085}{(H8799)}, or whether they will forbear{H2308}{(H8799)}: for they are most rebellious{H4805}."
Ezekiel,2,8,"But thou, son{H1121} of man{H120}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} what I say{H1696}{(H8764)} unto thee; Be not{H1961}{(H8799)} thou rebellious{H4805} like that rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}: open{H6475}{(H8798)} thy mouth{H6310}, and eat{H398}{(H8798)} that I give{H5414}{(H8802)} thee."
Ezekiel,2,9,"And when I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, behold, an hand{H3027} was sent{H7971}{(H8803)} unto me; and, lo, a roll{H4039} of a book{H5612} was therein;"
Ezekiel,2,10,"And he spread{H6566}{(H8799)} it before{H6440} me; and it was written{H3789}{(H8803)} within{H6440} and without{H268}: and there was written{H3789}{(H8803)} therein lamentations{H7015}, and mourning{H1899}, and woe{H1958}."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Moreover he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, eat{H398}{(H8798)} that thou findest{H4672}{(H8799)}; eat{H398}{(H8798)} this roll{H4039}, and go{H3212}{(H8798)} speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened{H6605}{(H8799)} my mouth{H6310}, and he caused me to eat{H398}{(H8686)} that roll{H4039}."
Ezekiel,3,3,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, cause thy belly{H990} to eat{H398}{(H8686)}, and fill{H4390}{(H8762)} thy bowels{H4578} with this roll{H4039} that I give{H5414}{(H8802)} thee. Then did I eat{H398}{(H8799)} it; and it was in my mouth{H6310} as honey{H1706} for sweetness{H4966}."
Ezekiel,3,4,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, go{H3212}{(H8798)}, get{H935}{(H8798)} thee unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} with my words{H1697} unto them."
Ezekiel,3,5,"For thou art not sent{H7971}{(H8803)} to a people{H5971} of a strange{H6012} speech{H8193} and of an hard{H3515} language{H3956}, but to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478};"
Ezekiel,3,6,"Not to many{H7227} people{H5971} of a strange{H6012} speech{H8193} and of an hard{H3515} language{H3956}, whose words{H1697} thou canst not understand{H8085}{(H8799)}. Surely, had I sent{H7971}{(H8804)} thee to them, they would have hearkened{H8085}{(H8799)} unto thee."
Ezekiel,3,7,But the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} will{H14}{(H8799)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto thee; for they will{H14}{(H8802)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto me: for all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} are impudent{H2389}{H4696} and hardhearted{H7186}{H3820}.
Ezekiel,3,8,"Behold, I have made{H5414}{(H8804)} thy face{H6440} strong{H2389} against{H5980} their faces{H6440}, and thy forehead{H4696} strong{H2389} against{H5980} their foreheads{H4696}."
Ezekiel,3,9,"As an adamant{H8068} harder{H2389} than flint{H6864} have I made{H5414}{(H8804)} thy forehead{H4696}: fear{H3372}{(H8799)} them not, neither be dismayed{H2865}{(H8735)} at their looks{H6440}, though they be a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,3,10,"Moreover he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, all my words{H1697} that I shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} unto thee receive{H3947}{(H8798)} in thine heart{H3824}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} with thine ears{H241}."
Ezekiel,3,11,"And go{H3212}{(H8798)}, get{H935}{(H8798)} thee to them of the captivity{H1473}, unto the children{H1121} of thy people{H5971}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} unto them, and tell{H559}{(H8804)} them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; whether they will hear{H8085}{(H8799)}, or whether they will forbear{H2308}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the spirit{H7307} took me up{H5375}{(H8799)}, and I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} behind{H310} me a voice{H6963} of a great{H1419} rushing{H7494}, saying, Blessed{H1288}{(H8803)} be the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} from his place{H4725}."
Ezekiel,3,13,"I heard also the noise{H6963} of the wings{H3671} of the living creatures{H2416} that touched{H5401}{(H8688)} one{H802} another{H269}, and the noise{H6963} of the wheels{H212} over against{H5980} them, and a noise{H6963} of a great{H1419} rushing{H7494}."
Ezekiel,3,14,"So the spirit{H7307} lifted me up{H5375}{(H8804)}, and took me away{H3947}{(H8799)}, and I went{H3212}{(H8799)} in bitterness{H4751}, in the heat{H2534} of my spirit{H7307}; but the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was strong{H2388}{(H8804)} upon me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"Then I came{H935}{(H8799)} to them of the captivity{H1473} at Telabib{H8512}, that dwelt{H3427}{(H8802)} by the river{H5104} of Chebar{H3529}, and I sat{H3427}{(H8799)} where they sat{H3427}{(H8799)}, and remained{H3427}{(H8799)} there astonished{H8074}{(H8688)} among{H8432} them seven{H7651} days{H3117}."
Ezekiel,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end{H7097} of seven{H7651} days{H3117}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,3,17,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, I have made{H5414}{(H8804)} thee a watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}: therefore hear{H8085}{(H8804)} the word{H1697} at my mouth{H6310}, and give them warning{H2094}{(H8689)} from me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say{H559}{(H8800)} unto the wicked{H7563}, Thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}; and thou givest him not warning{H2094}{(H8689)}, nor speakest{H1696}{(H8765)} to warn{H2094}{(H8687)} the wicked{H7563} from his wicked{H7563} way{H1870}, to save his life{H2421}{(H8763)}; the same wicked{H7563} man shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} in his iniquity{H5771}; but his blood{H1818} will I require{H1245}{(H8762)} at thine hand{H3027}."
Ezekiel,3,19,"Yet if thou warn{H2094}{(H8689)} the wicked{H7563}, and he turn{H7725}{(H8804)} not from his wickedness{H7562}, nor from his wicked{H7563} way{H1870}, he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} in his iniquity{H5771}; but thou hast delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} thy soul{H5315}."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Again{H7725}, When a righteous{H6662} man doth turn{H7725}{(H8800)} from his righteousness{H6664}, and commit{H6213}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}, and I lay{H5414}{(H8804)} a stumblingblock{H4383} before{H6440} him, he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)}: because thou hast not given him warning{H2094}{(H8689)}, he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} in his sin{H2403}, and his righteousness{H6666} which he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} shall not be remembered{H2142}{(H8735)}; but his blood{H1818} will I require{H1245}{(H8762)} at thine hand{H3027}."
Ezekiel,3,21,"Nevertheless if thou warn{H2094}{(H8689)} the righteous{H6662} man, that the righteous{H6662} sin{H2398}{(H8800)} not, and he doth not sin{H2398}{(H8804)}, he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}, because he is warned{H2094}{(H8737)}; also thou hast delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} thy soul{H5315}."
Ezekiel,3,22,"And the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was there upon me; and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Arise{H6965}{(H8798)}, go forth{H3318}{(H8798)} into the plain{H1237}, and I will there talk{H1696}{(H8762)} with thee."
Ezekiel,3,23,"Then I arose{H6965}{(H8799)}, and went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} into the plain{H1237}: and, behold, the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} there, as the glory{H3519} which I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} by the river{H5104} of Chebar{H3529}: and I fell{H5307}{(H8799)} on my face{H6440}."
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then the spirit{H7307} entered{H935}{(H8799)} into me, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} me upon my feet{H7272}, and spake{H1696}{(H8762)} with me, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Go{H935}{(H8798)}, shut{H5462}{(H8734)} thyself within{H8432} thine house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,3,25,"But thou, O son{H1121} of man{H120}, behold, they shall put{H5414}{(H8804)} bands{H5688} upon thee, and shall bind{H631}{(H8804)} thee with them, and thou shalt not go out{H3318}{(H8799)} among{H8432} them:"
Ezekiel,3,26,"And I will make thy tongue{H3956} cleave{H1692}{(H8686)} to the roof of thy mouth{H2441}, that thou shalt be dumb{H481}{(H8738)}, and shalt not be to them a reprover{H376}{H3198}{(H8688)}: for they are a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak{H1696}{(H8763)} with{H854} thee, I will open{H6605}{(H8799)} thy mouth{H6310}, and thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; He that heareth{H8085}{(H8802)}, let him hear{H8085}{(H8799)}; and he that forbeareth{H2310}, let him forbear{H2308}{(H8799)}: for they are a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,4,1,"Thou also, son{H1121} of man{H120}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} thee a tile{H3843}, and lay{H5414}{(H8804)} it before{H6440} thee, and pourtray{H2710}{(H8804)} upon it the city{H5892}, even Jerusalem{H3389}:"
Ezekiel,4,2,"And lay{H5414}{(H8804)} siege{H4692} against it, and build{H1129}{(H8804)} a fort{H1785} against it, and cast{H8210}{(H8804)} a mount{H5550} against it; set{H5414}{(H8804)} the camp{H4264} also against it, and set{H7760}{(H8798)} battering rams{H3733} against it round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Moreover take{H3947}{(H8798)} thou unto thee an iron{H1270} pan{H4227}, and set{H5414}{(H8804)} it for a wall{H7023} of iron{H1270} between thee and the city{H5892}: and set{H3559}{(H8689)} thy face{H6440} against it, and it shall be besieged{H4692}, and thou shalt lay siege{H6696}{(H8804)} against it. This shall be a sign{H226} to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,4,4,"Lie{H7901}{(H8798)} thou also upon thy left{H8042} side{H6654}, and lay{H7760}{(H8804)} the iniquity{H5771} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} upon it: according to the number{H4557} of the days{H3117} that thou shalt lie{H7901}{(H8799)} upon it thou shalt bear{H5375}{(H8799)} their iniquity{H5771}."
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I have laid{H5414}{(H8804)} upon thee the years{H8141} of their iniquity{H5771}, according to the number{H4557} of the days{H3117}, three{H7969} hundred{H3967} and ninety{H8673} days{H3117}: so shalt thou bear{H5375}{(H8804)} the iniquity{H5771} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,4,6,"And when thou hast accomplished{H3615}{(H8765)} them{H428}, lie{H7901}{(H8804)} again{H8145} on thy right{H3233}{(H8675)}{H3227} side{H6654}, and thou shalt bear{H5375}{(H8804)} the iniquity{H5771} of the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} forty{H705} days{H3117}: I have appointed{H5414}{(H8804)} thee each day{H3117}{H3117} for a year{H8141}{H8141}."
Ezekiel,4,7,"Therefore thou shalt set{H3559}{(H8686)} thy face{H6440} toward the siege{H4692} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and thine arm{H2220} shall be uncovered{H2834}{(H8803)}, and thou shalt prophesy{H5012}{(H8738)} against it."
Ezekiel,4,8,"And, behold, I will lay{H5414}{(H8804)} bands{H5688} upon thee, and thou shalt not turn{H2015}{(H8735)} thee from one side{H6654} to another{H6654}, till thou hast ended{H3615}{(H8763)} the days{H3117} of thy siege{H4692}."
Ezekiel,4,9,"Take{H3947}{(H8798)} thou also unto thee wheat{H2406}, and barley{H8184}, and beans{H6321}, and lentiles{H5742}, and millet{H1764}, and fitches{H3698}, and put{H5414}{(H8804)} them in one{H259} vessel{H3627}, and make{H6213}{(H8804)} thee bread{H3899} thereof, according to the number{H4557} of the days{H3117} that thou shalt lie{H7901}{(H8802)} upon thy side{H6654}, three{H7969} hundred{H3967} and ninety{H8673} days{H3117} shalt thou eat{H398}{(H8799)} thereof."
Ezekiel,4,10,"And thy meat{H3978} which thou shalt eat{H398}{(H8799)} shall be by weight{H4946}, twenty{H6242} shekels{H8255} a day{H3117}: from time{H6256} to time{H6256} shalt thou eat{H398}{(H8799)} it."
Ezekiel,4,11,"Thou shalt drink{H8354}{(H8799)} also water{H4325} by measure{H4884}, the sixth part{H8345} of an hin{H1969}: from time{H6256} to time{H6256} shalt thou drink{H8354}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,4,12,"And thou shalt eat{H398}{(H8799)} it as barley{H8184} cakes{H5692}, and thou shalt bake{H5746}{(H8799)} it with dung{H1561} that cometh out{H6627} of man{H120}, in their sight{H5869}."
Ezekiel,4,13,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)}, Even thus shall the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} eat{H398}{(H8799)} their defiled{H2931} bread{H3899} among the Gentiles{H1471}, whither I will drive{H5080}{(H8686)} them."
Ezekiel,4,14,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, Ah{H162} Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}! behold, my soul{H5315} hath not been polluted{H2930}{(H8794)}: for from my youth{H5271} up even till now have I not eaten{H398}{(H8804)} of that which dieth of itself{H5038}, or is torn in pieces{H2966}; neither came{H935}{(H8804)} there abominable{H6292} flesh{H1320} into my mouth{H6310}."
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Lo{H7200}{(H8798)}, I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} thee cow's{H1241} dung{H6832}{(H8675)}{H6832} for man's{H120} dung{H1561}, and thou shalt prepare{H6213}{(H8804)} thy bread{H3899} therewith."
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreover he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, behold, I will break{H7665}{(H8799)} the staff{H4294} of bread{H3899} in Jerusalem{H3389}: and they shall eat{H398}{(H8804)} bread{H3899} by weight{H4948}, and with care{H1674}; and they shall drink{H8354}{(H8799)} water{H4325} by measure{H4884}, and with astonishment{H8078}:"
Ezekiel,4,17,"That they may want{H2637}{(H8799)} bread{H3899} and water{H4325}, and be astonied{H8074}{(H8738)} one{H376} with another{H251}, and consume away{H4743}{(H8738)} for their iniquity{H5771}."
Ezekiel,5,1,"And thou, son{H1121} of man{H120}, take{H3947}{(H8798)} thee a sharp{H2299} knife{H2719}, take{H3947}{(H8799)} thee a barber's{H1532} razor{H8593}, and cause it to pass{H5674}{(H8689)} upon thine head{H7218} and upon thy beard{H2206}: then take{H3947}{(H8804)} thee balances{H3976} to weigh{H4948}, and divide{H2505}{(H8765)} the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,"Thou shalt burn{H1197}{(H8686)} with fire{H217} a third part{H7992} in the midst{H8432} of the city{H5892}, when the days{H3117} of the siege{H4692} are fulfilled{H4390}{(H8800)}: and thou shalt take{H3947}{(H8804)} a third part{H7992}, and smite{H5221}{(H8686)} about{H5439} it with a knife{H2719}: and a third part{H7992} thou shalt scatter{H2219}{(H8799)} in the wind{H7307}; and I will draw out{H7324}{(H8686)} a sword{H2719} after{H310} them."
Ezekiel,5,3,"Thou shalt also take{H3947}{(H8804)} thereof a few{H4592} in number{H4557}, and bind{H6696}{(H8804)} them in thy skirts{H3671}."
Ezekiel,5,4,"Then take of them again{H3947}{(H8799)}, and cast{H7993}{(H8689)} them into the midst{H8432} of the fire{H784}, and burn{H8313}{(H8804)} them in the fire{H784}; for thereof shall a fire{H784} come forth{H3318}{(H8799)} into all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,5,5,Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; This is Jerusalem{H3389}: I have set{H7760}{(H8804)} it in the midst{H8432} of the nations{H1471} and countries{H776} that are round about{H5439} her.
Ezekiel,5,6,"And she hath changed{H4784}{(H8686)} my judgments{H4941} into wickedness{H7564} more than the nations{H1471}, and my statutes{H2708} more than the countries{H776} that are round about{H5439} her: for they have refused{H3988}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941} and my statutes{H2708}, they have not walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in them."
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because ye multiplied{H1995}{(H8800)} more than the nations{H1471} that are round about{H5439} you, and have not walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in my statutes{H2708}, neither have kept{H6213}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941}, neither have done{H6213}{(H8804)} according to the judgments{H4941} of the nations{H1471} that are round about{H5439} you;"
Ezekiel,5,8,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute{H6213}{(H8804)} judgments{H4941} in the midst{H8432} of thee in the sight{H5869} of the nations{H1471}."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And I will do{H6213}{(H8804)} in thee that which I have not done{H6213}{(H8804)}, and whereunto I will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} any more the like, because{H3282} of all thine abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore the fathers{H1} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} the sons{H1121} in the midst{H8432} of thee, and the sons{H1121} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} their fathers{H1}; and I will execute{H6213}{(H8804)} judgments{H8201} in thee, and the whole remnant{H7611} of thee will I scatter{H2219}{(H8765)} into all the winds{H7307}."
Ezekiel,5,11,"Wherefore, as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Surely, because thou hast defiled{H2930}{(H8765)} my sanctuary{H4720} with all thy detestable things{H8251}, and with all thine abominations{H8441}, therefore will I also diminish{H1639}{(H8799)} thee; neither shall mine eye{H5869} spare{H2347}{(H8799)}, neither will I have any pity{H2550}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,5,12,"A third part{H7992} of thee shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} with the pestilence{H1698}, and with famine{H7458} shall they be consumed{H3615}{(H8799)} in the midst{H8432} of thee: and a third part{H7992} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719} round about{H5439} thee; and I will scatter{H2219}{(H8762)} a third part{H7992} into all the winds{H7307}, and I will draw out{H7324}{(H8686)} a sword{H2719} after{H310} them."
Ezekiel,5,13,"Thus shall mine anger{H639} be accomplished{H3615}{(H8804)}, and I will cause my fury{H2534} to rest{H5117}{(H8689)} upon them, and I will be comforted{H5162}{(H8694)}: and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I the LORD{H3068} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it in my zeal{H7068}, when I have accomplished{H3615}{(H8763)} my fury{H2534} in them."
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreover I will make{H5414}{(H8799)} thee waste{H2723}, and a reproach{H2781} among the nations{H1471} that are round about{H5439} thee, in the sight{H5869} of all that pass by{H5674}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,5,15,"So it shall be a reproach{H2781} and a taunt{H1422}, an instruction{H4148} and an astonishment{H4923} unto the nations{H1471} that are round about{H5439} thee, when I shall execute{H6213}{(H8800)} judgments{H8201} in thee in anger{H639} and in fury{H2534} and in furious{H2534} rebukes{H8433}. I the LORD{H3068} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I shall send{H7971}{(H8762)} upon them the evil{H7451} arrows{H2671} of famine{H7458}, which shall be for their destruction{H4889}, and which I will send{H7971}{(H8763)} to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} you: and I will increase{H3254}{(H8686)} the famine{H7458} upon you, and will break{H7665}{(H8804)} your staff{H4294} of bread{H3899}:"
Ezekiel,5,17,"So will I send{H7971}{(H8765)} upon you famine{H7458} and evil{H7451} beasts{H2416}, and they shall bereave{H7921}{(H8765)} thee; and pestilence{H1698} and blood{H1818} shall pass through{H5674}{(H8799)} thee; and I will bring{H935}{(H8686)} the sword{H2719} upon thee. I the LORD{H3068} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,6,1,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,6,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} toward the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against them,"
Ezekiel,6,3,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Ye mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} to the mountains{H2022}, and to the hills{H1389}, to the rivers{H650}, and to the valleys{H1516}; Behold, I, even I, will bring{H935}{(H8688)} a sword{H2719} upon you, and I will destroy{H6}{(H8765)} your high places{H1116}."
Ezekiel,6,4,"And your altars{H4196} shall be desolate{H8074}{(H8738)}, and your images{H2553} shall be broken{H7665}{(H8738)}: and I will cast down{H5307}{(H8689)} your slain{H2491} men before{H6440} your idols{H1544}."
Ezekiel,6,5,And I will lay{H5414}{(H8804)} the dead carcases{H6297} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} before{H6440} their idols{H1544}; and I will scatter{H2219}{(H8765)} your bones{H6106} round about{H5439} your altars{H4196}.
Ezekiel,6,6,"In all your dwellingplaces{H4186} the cities{H5892} shall be laid waste{H2717}{(H8799)}, and the high places{H1116} shall be desolate{H3456}{(H8799)}; that your altars{H4196} may be laid waste{H2717}{(H8799)} and made desolate{H816}{(H8799)}, and your idols{H1544} may be broken{H7665}{(H8738)} and cease{H7673}{(H8738)}, and your images{H2553} may be cut down{H1438}{(H8738)}, and your works{H4639} may be abolished{H4229}{(H8738)}."
Ezekiel,6,7,"And the slain{H2491} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of you, and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,6,8,"Yet will I leave a remnant{H3498}{(H8689)}, that ye may have some that shall escape{H6412} the sword{H2719} among the nations{H1471}, when ye shall be scattered{H2219}{(H8736)} through the countries{H776}."
Ezekiel,6,9,"And they that escape{H6412} of you shall remember{H2142}{(H8804)} me among the nations{H1471} whither they shall be carried captives{H7617}{(H8738)}, because I am broken{H7665}{(H8738)} with their whorish{H2181}{(H8802)} heart{H3820}, which hath departed{H5493}{(H8804)} from me, and with their eyes{H5869}, which go a whoring{H2181}{(H8802)} after{H310} their idols{H1544}: and they shall lothe{H6962}{(H8738)} themselves{H6440} for the evils{H7451} which they have committed{H6213}{(H8804)} in all their abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,6,10,"And they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, and that I have not said{H1696}{(H8765)} in vain{H2600} that I would do{H6213}{(H8800)} this evil{H7451} unto them."
Ezekiel,6,11,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Smite{H5221}{(H8685)} with thine hand{H3709}, and stamp{H7554}{(H8798)} with thy foot{H7272}, and say{H559}{(H8798)}, Alas{H253} for all the evil{H7451} abominations{H8441} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}! for they shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, by the famine{H7458}, and by the pestilence{H1698}."
Ezekiel,6,12,He that is far off{H7350} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} of the pestilence{H1698}; and he that is near{H7138} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}; and he that remaineth{H7604}{(H8737)} and is besieged{H5341}{(H8803)} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} by the famine{H7458}: thus will I accomplish{H3615}{(H8765)} my fury{H2534} upon them.
Ezekiel,6,13,"Then shall ye know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when their slain{H2491} men shall be among{H8432} their idols{H1544} round about{H5439} their altars{H4196}, upon every high{H7311}{(H8802)} hill{H1389}, in all the tops{H7218} of the mountains{H2022}, and under every green{H7488} tree{H6086}, and under every thick{H5687} oak{H424}, the place{H4725} where they did offer{H5414}{(H8804)} sweet{H5207} savour{H7381} to all their idols{H1544}."
Ezekiel,6,14,"So will I stretch out{H5186}{(H8804)} my hand{H3027} upon them, and make{H5414}{(H8804)} the land{H776} desolate{H8077}, yea, more desolate{H4923} than the wilderness{H4057} toward Diblath{H1689}, in all their habitations{H4186}: and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,7,1,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,7,2,"Also, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} unto the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}; An end{H7093}, the end{H7093} is come{H935}{(H8804)} upon the four{H702} corners{H3671} of the land{H776}."
Ezekiel,7,3,"Now is the end{H7093} come upon thee, and I will send{H7971}{(H8765)} mine anger{H639} upon thee, and will judge{H8199}{(H8804)} thee according to thy ways{H1870}, and will recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} upon thee all thine abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,7,4,"And mine eye{H5869} shall not spare{H2347}{(H8799)} thee, neither will I have pity{H2550}{(H8799)}: but I will recompense{H5414}{(H8799)} thy ways{H1870} upon thee, and thine abominations{H8441} shall be in the midst{H8432} of thee: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,7,5,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; An evil{H7451}, an only{H259} evil{H7451}, behold, is come{H935}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end{H7093} is come{H935}{(H8804)}, the end{H7093} is come{H935}{(H8804)}: it watcheth{H6974}{(H8689)} for thee; behold, it is come{H935}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,7,7,"The morning{H6843} is come{H935}{(H8804)} unto thee, O thou that dwellest{H3427}{(H8802)} in the land{H776}: the time{H6256} is come{H935}{(H8804)}{(H8676)}{H935}{(H8802)}, the day{H3117} of trouble{H4103} is near{H7138}, and not the sounding again{H1906} of the mountains{H2022}."
Ezekiel,7,8,"Now will I shortly{H7138} pour out{H8210}{(H8799)} my fury{H2534} upon thee, and accomplish{H3615}{(H8765)} mine anger{H639} upon thee: and I will judge{H8199}{(H8804)} thee according to thy ways{H1870}, and will recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} thee for all thine abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,7,9,"And mine eye{H5869} shall not spare{H2347}{(H8799)}, neither will I have pity{H2550}{(H8799)}: I will recompense{H5414}{(H8799)} thee according to thy ways{H1870} and thine abominations{H8441} that are in the midst{H8432} of thee; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068} that smiteth{H5221}{(H8688)}."
Ezekiel,7,10,"Behold the day{H3117}, behold, it is come{H935}{(H8802)}: the morning{H6843} is gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)}; the rod{H4294} hath blossomed{H6692}{(H8804)}, pride{H2087} hath budded{H6524}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence{H2555} is risen up{H6965}{(H8804)} into a rod{H4294} of wickedness{H7562}: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude{H1995}, nor of any{H1991} of theirs: neither shall there be wailing{H5089} for them."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time{H6256} is come{H935}{(H8804)}, the day{H3117} draweth near{H5060}{(H8689)}: let not the buyer{H7069}{(H8802)} rejoice{H8055}{(H8799)}, nor the seller{H4376}{(H8802)} mourn{H56}{(H8691)}: for wrath{H2740} is upon all the multitude{H1995} thereof."
Ezekiel,7,13,"For the seller{H4376}{(H8802)} shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)} to that which is sold{H4465}, although they were yet alive{H2416}: for the vision{H2377} is touching the whole multitude{H1995} thereof, which shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)}; neither shall any{H376} strengthen{H2388}{(H8691)} himself in the iniquity{H5771} of his life{H2416}."
Ezekiel,7,14,"They have blown{H8628}{(H8804)} the trumpet{H8619}, even to make all ready{H3559}{(H8687)}; but none goeth{H1980}{(H8802)} to the battle{H4421}: for my wrath{H2740} is upon all the multitude{H1995} thereof."
Ezekiel,7,15,"The sword{H2719} is without{H2351}, and the pestilence{H1698} and the famine{H7458} within{H1004}: he that is in the field{H7704} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} with the sword{H2719}; and he that is in the city{H5892}, famine{H7458} and pestilence{H1698} shall devour{H398}{(H8799)} him."
Ezekiel,7,16,"But they that escape{H6403}{(H8804)} of them shall escape{H6412}, and shall be on the mountains{H2022} like doves{H3123} of the valleys{H1516}, all of them mourning{H1993}{(H8802)}, every one{H376} for his iniquity{H5771}."
Ezekiel,7,17,"All hands{H3027} shall be feeble{H7503}{(H8799)}, and all knees{H1290} shall be weak{H3212}{(H8799)} as water{H4325}."
Ezekiel,7,18,"They shall also gird{H2296}{(H8804)} themselves with sackcloth{H8242}, and horror{H6427} shall cover{H3680}{(H8765)} them; and shame{H955} shall be upon all faces{H6440}, and baldness{H7144} upon all their heads{H7218}."
Ezekiel,7,19,"They shall cast{H7993}{(H8686)} their silver{H3701} in the streets{H2351}, and their gold{H2091} shall be removed{H5079}: their silver{H3701} and their gold{H2091} shall not be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to deliver{H5337}{(H8687)} them in the day{H3117} of the wrath{H5678} of the LORD{H3068}: they shall not satisfy{H7646}{(H8762)} their souls{H5315}, neither fill{H4390}{(H8762)} their bowels{H4578}: because it is the stumblingblock{H4383} of their iniquity{H5771}."
Ezekiel,7,20,"As for the beauty{H6643} of his ornament{H5716}, he set{H7760}{(H8804)} it in majesty{H1347}: but they made{H6213}{(H8804)} the images{H6754} of their abominations{H8441} and of their detestable things{H8251} therein: therefore have I set{H5414}{(H8804)} it far{H5079} from them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"And I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} it into the hands{H3027} of the strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} for a prey{H957}, and to the wicked{H7563} of the earth{H776} for a spoil{H7998}; and they shall pollute{H2490}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"My face{H6440} will I turn{H5437}{(H8689)} also from them, and they shall pollute{H2490}{(H8765)} my secret{H6845}{(H8803)} place: for the robbers{H6530} shall enter{H935}{(H8804)} into it, and defile{H2490}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,7,23,"Make{H6213}{(H8798)} a chain{H7569}: for the land{H776} is full{H4390}{(H8804)} of bloody{H1818} crimes{H4941}, and the city{H5892} is full{H4390}{(H8804)} of violence{H2555}."
Ezekiel,7,24,"Wherefore I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} the worst{H7451} of the heathen{H1471}, and they shall possess{H3423}{(H8804)} their houses{H1004}: I will also make the pomp{H1347} of the strong{H5794} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)}; and their holy places{H6942}{(H8764)} shall be defiled{H2490}{(H8738)}{(H8676)}{H5157}{(H8765)}."
Ezekiel,7,25,"Destruction{H7089} cometh{H935}{(H8804)}; and they shall seek{H1245}{(H8765)} peace{H7965}, and there shall be none."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Mischief{H1943} shall come{H935}{(H8799)} upon mischief{H1943}, and rumour{H8052} shall be upon rumour{H8052}; then shall they seek{H1245}{(H8765)} a vision{H2377} of the prophet{H5030}; but the law{H8451} shall perish{H6}{(H8799)} from the priest{H3548}, and counsel{H6098} from the ancients{H2205}."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king{H4428} shall mourn{H56}{(H8691)}, and the prince{H5387} shall be clothed{H3847}{(H8799)} with desolation{H8077}, and the hands{H3027} of the people{H5971} of the land{H776} shall be troubled{H926}{(H8735)}: I will do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto them after their way{H1870}, and according to their deserts{H4941} will I judge{H8199}{(H8799)} them; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth{H8345} year{H8141}, in the sixth{H8345} month, in the fifth{H2568} day of the month{H2320}, as I sat{H3427}{(H8802)} in mine house{H1004}, and the elders{H2205} of Judah{H3063} sat{H3427}{(H8802)} before{H6440} me, that the hand{H3027} of the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} there upon me."
Ezekiel,8,2,"Then I beheld{H7200}{(H8799)}, and lo a likeness{H1823} as the appearance{H4758} of fire{H784}: from the appearance{H4758} of his loins{H4975} even downward{H4295}, fire{H784}; and from his loins{H4975} even upward{H4605}, as the appearance{H4758} of brightness{H2096}, as the colour{H5869} of amber{H2830}."
Ezekiel,8,3,"And he put forth{H7971}{(H8799)} the form{H8403} of an hand{H3027}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} me by a lock{H6734} of mine head{H7218}; and the spirit{H7307} lifted me up{H5375}{(H8799)} between the earth{H776} and the heaven{H8064}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} me in the visions{H4759} of God{H430} to Jerusalem{H3389}, to the door{H6607} of the inner{H6442} gate{H8179} that looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the north{H6828}; where was the seat{H4186} of the image{H5566} of jealousy{H7068}, which provoketh to jealousy{H7069}{(H8688)}."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And, behold, the glory{H3519} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} was there, according to the vision{H4758} that I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} in the plain{H1237}."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, lift up{H5375}{(H8798)} thine eyes{H5869} now the way{H1870} toward the north{H6828}. So I lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869} the way{H1870} toward the north{H6828}, and behold northward{H6828} at the gate{H8179} of the altar{H4196} this image{H5566} of jealousy{H7068} in the entry{H872}."
Ezekiel,8,6,"He said{H559}{(H8799)} furthermore unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, seest{H7200}{(H8802)} thou what they do{H6213}{(H8802)}? even the great{H1419} abominations{H8441} that the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} committeth{H6213}{(H8802)} here, that I should go far off{H7368}{(H8800)} from my sanctuary{H4720}? but turn{H7725}{(H8799)} thee yet again, and thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8799)} greater{H1419} abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,8,7,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me to the door{H6607} of the court{H2691}; and when I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, behold a{H259} hole{H2356} in the wall{H7023}."
Ezekiel,8,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, dig{H2864}{(H8798)} now in the wall{H7023}: and when I had digged{H2864}{(H8799)} in the wall{H7023}, behold a{H259} door{H6607}."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Go in{H935}{(H8798)}, and behold{H7200}{(H8798)} the wicked{H7451} abominations{H8441} that they do{H6213}{(H8802)} here."
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in{H935}{(H8799)} and saw{H7200}{(H8799)}; and behold every form{H8403} of creeping things{H7431}, and abominable{H8263} beasts{H929}, and all the idols{H1544} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, pourtrayed{H2707}{(H8794)} upon the wall{H7023} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,8,11,"And there stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} them seventy{H7657} men{H376} of the ancients{H2205} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, and in the midst{H8432} of them stood{H5975}{(H8802)} Jaazaniah{H2970} the son{H1121} of Shaphan{H8227}, with every man{H376} his censer{H4730} in his hand{H3027}; and a thick{H6282} cloud{H6051} of incense{H7004} went up{H5927}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, hast thou seen{H7200}{(H8804)} what the ancients{H2205} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} do{H6213}{(H8802)} in the dark{H2822}, every man{H376} in the chambers{H2315} of his imagery{H4906}? for they say{H559}{(H8802)}, The LORD{H3068} seeth{H7200}{(H8802)} us not; the LORD{H3068} hath forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the earth{H776}."
Ezekiel,8,13,"He said{H559}{(H8799)} also unto me, Turn{H7725}{(H8799)} thee yet again, and thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8799)} greater{H1419} abominations{H8441} that they do{H6213}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,8,14,"Then he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me to the door{H6607} of the gate{H8179} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004} which was toward the north{H6828}; and, behold, there sat{H3427}{(H8802)} women{H802} weeping{H1058}{(H8764)} for Tammuz{H8542}."
Ezekiel,8,15,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Hast thou seen{H7200}{(H8804)} this, O son{H1121} of man{H120}? turn{H7725}{(H8799)} thee yet again, and thou shalt see{H7200}{(H8799)} greater{H1419} abominations{H8441} than these."
Ezekiel,8,16,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me into the inner{H6442} court{H2691} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}, and, behold, at the door{H6607} of the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, between the porch{H197} and the altar{H4196}, were about five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} men{H376}, with their backs{H268} toward the temple{H1964} of the LORD{H3068}, and their faces{H6440} toward the east{H6924}; and they worshipped{H7812}{(H8693)} the sun{H8121} toward the east{H6924}."
Ezekiel,8,17,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Hast thou seen{H7200}{(H8804)} this, O son{H1121} of man{H120}? Is it a light thing{H7043}{(H8738)} to the house{H1004} of Judah{H3063} that they commit{H6213}{(H8800)} the abominations{H8441} which they commit{H6213}{(H8804)} here? for they have filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the land{H776} with violence{H2555}, and have returned{H7725}{(H8799)} to provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}: and, lo, they put{H7971}{(H8802)} the branch{H2156} to their nose{H639}."
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal{H6213}{(H8799)} in fury{H2534}: mine eye{H5869} shall not spare{H2347}{(H8799)}, neither will I have pity{H2550}{(H8799)}: and though they cry{H7121}{(H8804)} in mine ears{H241} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, yet will I not hear{H8085}{(H8799)} them."
Ezekiel,9,1,"He cried{H7121}{(H8799)} also in mine ears{H241} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Cause them that have charge{H6486} over the city{H5892} to draw near{H7126}{(H8804)}, even every man{H376} with his destroying{H4892} weapon{H3627} in his hand{H3027}."
Ezekiel,9,2,"And, behold, six{H8337} men{H582} came{H935}{(H8802)} from the way{H1870} of the higher{H5945} gate{H8179}, which lieth{H6437}{(H8716)} toward the north{H6828}, and every man{H376} a slaughter{H4660} weapon{H3627} in his hand{H3027}; and one{H259} man{H376} among{H8432} them was clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with linen{H906}, with a writer's{H5608}{(H8802)} inkhorn{H7083} by his side{H4975}: and they went in{H935}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} beside{H681} the brasen{H5178} altar{H4196}."
Ezekiel,9,3,"And the glory{H3519} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} was gone up{H5927}{(H8738)} from the cherub{H3742}, whereupon he was, to the threshold{H4670} of the house{H1004}. And he called{H7121}{(H8799)} to the man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with linen{H906}, which had the writer's{H5608}{(H8802)} inkhorn{H7083} by his side{H4975};"
Ezekiel,9,4,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto him, Go through{H5674}{(H8798)} the midst{H8432} of the city{H5892}, through the midst{H8432} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and set{H8427}{(H8689)} a mark{H8420} upon the foreheads{H4696} of the men{H582} that sigh{H584}{(H8737)} and that cry{H602}{(H8737)} for all the abominations{H8441} that be done{H6213}{(H8737)} in the midst{H8432} thereof."
Ezekiel,9,5,"And to the others{H428} he said{H559}{(H8804)} in mine hearing{H241}, Go{H5674}{(H8798)} ye after{H310} him through the city{H5892}, and smite{H5221}{(H8685)}: let not your eye{H5869} spare{H2347}{(H8799)}, neither have ye pity{H2550}{(H8799)}:"
Ezekiel,9,6,"Slay{H2026}{(H8799)} utterly{H4889} old{H2205} and young{H970}, both maids{H1330}, and little children{H2945}, and women{H802}: but come not near{H5066}{(H8799)} any man{H376} upon whom is the mark{H8420}; and begin{H2490}{(H8686)} at my sanctuary{H4720}. Then they began{H2490}{(H8686)} at the ancient{H2205} men{H582} which were before{H6440} the house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,9,7,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, Defile{H2930}{(H8761)} the house{H1004}, and fill{H4390}{(H8761)} the courts{H2691} with the slain{H2491}: go ye forth{H3318}{(H8798)}. And they went forth{H3318}{(H8804)}, and slew{H5221}{(H8689)} in the city{H5892}."
Ezekiel,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were slaying{H5221}{(H8687)} them, and I was left{H7604}{(H8737)}, that I fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon my face{H6440}, and cried{H2199}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ah{H162} Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}! wilt thou destroy{H7843}{(H8688)} all the residue{H7611} of Israel{H3478} in thy pouring out{H8210}{(H8800)} of thy fury{H2534} upon Jerusalem{H3389}?"
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, The iniquity{H5771} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} and Judah{H3063} is exceeding{H3966}{H3966} great{H1419}, and the land{H776} is full{H4390}{(H8735)} of blood{H1818}, and the city{H5892} full{H4390}{(H8804)} of perverseness{H4297}: for they say{H559}{(H8804)}, The LORD{H3068} hath forsaken{H5800}{(H8804)} the earth{H776}, and the LORD{H3068} seeth{H7200}{(H8802)} not."
Ezekiel,9,10,"And as for me also, mine eye{H5869} shall not spare{H2347}{(H8799)}, neither will I have pity{H2550}{(H8799)}, but I will recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} their way{H1870} upon their head{H7218}."
Ezekiel,9,11,"And, behold, the man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with linen{H906}, which had the inkhorn{H7083} by his side{H4975}, reported{H7725}{(H8688)} the matter{H1697}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} as thou hast commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} me."
Ezekiel,10,1,"Then I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, in the firmament{H7549} that was above the head{H7218} of the cherubims{H3742} there appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} over them as it were a sapphire{H5601} stone{H68}, as the appearance{H4758} of the likeness{H1823} of a throne{H3678}."
Ezekiel,10,2,"And he spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto the man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with linen{H906}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Go in{H935}{(H8798)} between{H996} the wheels{H1534}, even under the cherub{H3742}, and fill{H4390}{(H8761)} thine hand{H2651} with coals{H1513} of fire{H784} from between{H996} the cherubims{H3742}, and scatter{H2236}{(H8798)} them over the city{H5892}. And he went in{H935}{(H8799)} in my sight{H5869}."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubims{H3742} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} on the right side{H3225} of the house{H1004}, when the man{H376} went in{H935}{(H8800)}; and the cloud{H6051} filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the inner{H6442} court{H2691}."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} went up{H7311}{(H8799)} from the cherub{H3742}, and stood over the threshold{H4670} of the house{H1004}; and the house{H1004} was filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with the cloud{H6051}, and the court{H2691} was full{H4390}{(H8804)} of the brightness{H5051} of the LORD'S{H3068} glory{H3519}."
Ezekiel,10,5,"And the sound{H6963} of the cherubims{H3742}' wings{H3671} was heard{H8085}{(H8738)} even to the outer{H2435} court{H2691}, as the voice{H6963} of the Almighty{H7706} God{H410} when he speaketh{H1696}{(H8763)}."
Ezekiel,10,6,"And it came to pass, that when he had commanded{H6680}{(H8763)} the man{H376} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with linen{H906}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Take{H3947}{(H8798)} fire{H784} from between the wheels{H1534}, from between the cherubims{H3742}; then he went in{H935}{(H8799)}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} beside{H681} the wheels{H212}."
Ezekiel,10,7,"And one cherub{H3742} stretched forth{H7971}{(H8799)} his hand{H3027} from between the cherubims{H3742} unto the fire{H784} that was between the cherubims{H3742}, and took{H5375}{(H8799)} thereof, and put{H5414}{(H8799)} it into the hands{H2651} of him that was clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with linen{H906}: who took{H3947}{(H8799)} it, and went out{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,10,8,And there appeared{H7200}{(H8735)} in the cherubims{H3742} the form{H8403} of a man's{H120} hand{H3027} under their wings{H3671}.
Ezekiel,10,9,"And when I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, behold the four{H702} wheels{H212} by{H681} the cherubims{H3742}, one{H259} wheel{H212} by{H681} one{H259} cherub{H3742}, and another{H259} wheel{H212} by{H681} another{H259} cherub{H3742}: and the appearance{H4758} of the wheels{H212} was as the colour{H5869} of a beryl{H8658} stone{H68}."
Ezekiel,10,10,"And as for their appearances{H4758}, they four{H702} had one{H259} likeness{H1823}, as if a wheel{H212} had been in the midst{H8432} of a wheel{H212}."
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they went{H3212}{(H8800)}, they went{H3212}{(H8800)} upon their four{H702} sides{H7253}; they turned{H5437}{(H8735)} not as they went{H3212}{(H8800)}, but to the place{H4725} whither the head{H7218} looked{H6437}{(H8799)} they followed{H3212}{(H8799)}{H310} it; they turned{H5437}{(H8735)} not as they went{H3212}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,10,12,"And their whole body{H1320}, and their backs{H1354}, and their hands{H3027}, and their wings{H3671}, and the wheels{H212}, were full{H4392} of eyes{H5869} round about{H5439}, even the wheels{H212} that they four{H702} had."
Ezekiel,10,13,"As for the wheels{H212}, it was cried{H7121}{(H8795)} unto them in my hearing{H241}, O wheel{H1534}."
Ezekiel,10,14,"And every one{H259} had four{H702} faces{H6440}: the first{H259} face{H6440} was the face{H6440} of a cherub{H3742}, and the second{H8145} face{H6440} was the face{H6440} of a man{H120}, and the third{H7992} the face{H6440} of a lion{H738}, and the fourth{H7243} the face{H6440} of an eagle{H5404}."
Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubims{H3742} were lifted up{H7426}{(H8735)}. This is the living creature{H2416} that I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} by the river{H5104} of Chebar{H3529}.
Ezekiel,10,16,"And when the cherubims{H3742} went{H3212}{(H8800)}, the wheels{H212} went{H3212}{(H8799)} by them{H681}: and when the cherubims{H3742} lifted up{H5375}{(H8800)} their wings{H3671} to mount up{H7311}{(H8800)} from the earth{H776}, the same wheels{H212} also{H1992} turned{H5437}{(H8735)} not from beside{H681} them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When they stood{H5975}{(H8800)}, these stood{H5975}{(H8799)}; and when they were lifted up{H7311}{(H8800)}, these lifted up{H7426}{(H8735)} themselves also: for the spirit{H7307} of the living creature{H2416} was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,"Then the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} departed{H3318}{(H8799)} from off the threshold{H4670} of the house{H1004}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} over the cherubims{H3742}."
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the cherubims{H3742} lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} their wings{H3671}, and mounted up{H7426}{(H8735)} from the earth{H776} in my sight{H5869}: when they went out{H3318}{(H8800)}, the wheels{H212} also were beside{H5980} them, and every one stood{H5975}{(H8799)} at the door{H6607} of the east{H6931} gate{H8179} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}; and the glory{H3519} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} was over them above{H4605}."
Ezekiel,10,20,This is the living creature{H2416} that I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} under the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} by the river{H5104} of Chebar{H3529}; and I knew{H3045}{(H8799)} that they were the cherubims{H3742}.
Ezekiel,10,21,"Every one{H259} had four{H702} faces{H6440} apiece{H259}, and every one{H259} four{H702} wings{H3671}; and the likeness{H1823} of the hands{H3027} of a man{H120} was under their wings{H3671}."
Ezekiel,10,22,"And the likeness{H1823} of their faces{H6440} was the same{H1992} faces{H6440} which I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} by the river{H5104} of Chebar{H3529}, their appearances{H4758} and themselves: they went{H3212}{(H8799)} every one{H376} straight{H5676} forward{H6440}."
Ezekiel,11,1,"Moreover the spirit{H7307} lifted me up{H5375}{(H8799)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} me unto the east{H6931} gate{H8179} of the LORD'S{H3068} house{H1004}, which looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} eastward{H6921}: and behold at the door{H6607} of the gate{H8179} five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} men{H376}; among{H8432} whom I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} Jaazaniah{H2970} the son{H1121} of Azur{H5809}, and Pelatiah{H6410} the son{H1121} of Benaiah{H1141}, princes{H8269} of the people{H5971}."
Ezekiel,11,2,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, these are the men{H582} that devise{H2803}{(H8802)} mischief{H205}, and give{H3289}{(H8802)} wicked{H7451} counsel{H6098} in this city{H5892}:"
Ezekiel,11,3,"Which say{H559}{(H8802)}, It is not near{H7138}; let us build{H1129}{(H8800)} houses{H1004}: this city is the caldron{H5518}, and we be the flesh{H1320}."
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against them, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)}, O son{H1121} of man{H120}."
Ezekiel,11,5,"And the Spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068} fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon me, and said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Speak{H559}{(H8798)}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Thus have ye said{H559}{(H8799)}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}: for I know{H3045}{(H8804)} the things that come{H4609} into your mind{H7307}, every one of them."
Ezekiel,11,6,"Ye have multiplied{H7235}{(H8689)} your slain{H2491} in this city{H5892}, and ye have filled{H4390}{(H8765)} the streets{H2351} thereof with the slain{H2491}."
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Your slain{H2491} whom ye have laid{H7760}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of it, they are the flesh{H1320}, and this city is the caldron{H5518}: but I will bring you forth{H3318}{(H8689)} out of the midst{H8432} of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"Ye have feared{H3372}{(H8804)} the sword{H2719}; and I will bring{H935}{(H8686)} a sword{H2719} upon you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,11,9,"And I will bring you out{H3318}{(H8689)} of the midst{H8432} thereof, and deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} you into the hands{H3027} of strangers{H2114}{(H8801)}, and will execute{H6213}{(H8804)} judgments{H8201} among you."
Ezekiel,11,10,Ye shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}; I will judge{H8199}{(H8799)} you in the border{H1366} of Israel{H3478}; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}.
Ezekiel,11,11,"This city shall not be your caldron{H5518}, neither shall ye be the flesh{H1320} in the midst{H8432} thereof; but I will judge{H8199}{(H8799)} you in the border{H1366} of Israel{H3478}:"
Ezekiel,11,12,"And ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}: for ye have not walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in my statutes{H2706}, neither executed{H6213}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941}, but have done{H6213}{(H8804)} after the manners{H4941} of the heathen{H1471} that are round about{H5439} you."
Ezekiel,11,13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied{H5012}{(H8736)}, that Pelatiah{H6410} the son{H1121} of Benaiah{H1141} died{H4191}{(H8804)}. Then fell I down{H5307}{(H8799)} upon my face{H6440}, and cried{H2199}{(H8799)} with a loud{H1419} voice{H6963}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Ah{H162} Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}! wilt thou make{H6213}{(H8802)} a full end{H3617} of the remnant{H7611} of Israel{H3478}?"
Ezekiel,11,14,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,11,15,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, thy brethren{H251}, even thy brethren{H251}, the men{H582} of thy kindred{H1353}, and all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389} have said{H559}{(H8804)}, Get you far{H7368}{(H8798)} from the LORD{H3068}: unto us is this land{H776} given{H5414}{(H8738)} in possession{H4181}."
Ezekiel,11,16,"Therefore say{H559}{(H8798)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Although I have cast them far off{H7368}{(H8689)} among the heathen{H1471}, and although I have scattered{H6327}{(H8689)} them among the countries{H776}, yet will I be to them as a little{H4592} sanctuary{H4720} in the countries{H776} where they shall come{H935}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,11,17,"Therefore say{H559}{(H8798)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will even gather{H6908}{(H8765)} you from the people{H5971}, and assemble{H622}{(H8804)} you out of the countries{H776} where ye have been scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} you the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,11,18,"And they shall come{H935}{(H8804)} thither, and they shall take away{H5493}{(H8689)} all the detestable things{H8251} thereof and all the abominations{H8441} thereof from thence."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} them one{H259} heart{H3820}, and I will put{H5414}{(H8799)} a new{H2319} spirit{H7307} within{H7130} you; and I will take{H5493}{(H8689)} the stony{H68} heart{H3820} out of their flesh{H1320}, and will give{H5414}{(H8804)} them an heart{H3820} of flesh{H1320}:"
Ezekiel,11,20,"That they may walk{H3212}{(H8799)} in my statutes{H2708}, and keep{H8104}{(H8799)} mine ordinances{H4941}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} them: and they shall be my people{H5971}, and I will be their God{H430}."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for them whose heart{H3820} walketh{H1980}{(H8802)} after the heart{H3820} of their detestable things{H8251} and their abominations{H8441}, I will recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} their way{H1870} upon their own heads{H7218}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then did the cherubims{H3742} lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} their wings{H3671}, and the wheels{H212} beside{H5980} them; and the glory{H3519} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} was over them above{H4605}."
Ezekiel,11,23,"And the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from the midst{H8432} of the city{H5892}, and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} upon the mountain{H2022} which is on the east side{H6924} of the city{H5892}."
Ezekiel,11,24,"Afterwards the spirit{H7307} took me up{H5375}{(H8804)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} me in a vision{H4758} by the Spirit{H7307} of God{H430} into Chaldea{H3778}, to them of the captivity{H1473}. So the vision{H4758} that I had seen{H7200}{(H8804)} went up{H5927}{(H8799)} from me."
Ezekiel,11,25,Then I spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto them of the captivity{H1473} all the things{H1697} that the LORD{H3068} had shewed{H7200}{(H8689)} me.
Ezekiel,12,1,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} also came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,12,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, thou dwellest{H3427}{(H8802)} in the midst{H8432} of a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}, which have eyes{H5869} to see{H7200}{(H8800)}, and see{H7200}{(H8804)} not; they have ears{H241} to hear{H8085}{(H8800)}, and hear{H8085}{(H8804)} not: for they are a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,12,3,"Therefore, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, prepare{H6213}{(H8798)} thee stuff{H3627} for removing{H1473}, and remove{H1540}{(H8798)} by day{H3119} in their sight{H5869}; and thou shalt remove{H1540}{(H8804)} from thy place{H4725} to another{H312} place{H4725} in their sight{H5869}: it may be they will consider{H7200}{(H8799)}, though they be a rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,12,4,"Then shalt thou bring forth{H3318}{(H8689)} thy stuff{H3627} by day{H3119} in their sight{H5869}, as stuff{H3627} for removing{H1473}: and thou shalt go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} at even{H6153} in their sight{H5869}, as they that go forth{H4161} into captivity{H1473}."
Ezekiel,12,5,"Dig{H2864}{(H8798)} thou through the wall{H7023} in their sight{H5869}, and carry out{H3318}{(H8689)} thereby."
Ezekiel,12,6,"In their sight{H5869} shalt thou bear{H5375}{(H8799)} it upon thy shoulders{H3802}, and carry it forth{H3318}{(H8686)} in the twilight{H5939}: thou shalt cover{H3680}{(H8762)} thy face{H6440}, that thou see{H7200}{(H8799)} not the ground{H776}: for I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} thee for a sign{H4159} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,12,7,"And I did{H6213}{(H8799)} so as I was commanded{H6680}{(H8795)}: I brought forth{H3318}{(H8689)} my stuff{H3627} by day{H3119}, as stuff{H3627} for captivity{H1473}, and in the even{H6153} I digged{H2864}{(H8804)} through the wall{H7023} with mine hand{H3027}; I brought it forth{H3318}{(H8689)} in the twilight{H5939}, and I bare{H5375}{(H8804)} it upon my shoulder{H3802} in their sight{H5869}."
Ezekiel,12,8,"And in the morning{H1242} came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,12,9,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, hath not the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, the rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}, said{H559}{(H8804)} unto thee, What doest{H6213}{(H8802)} thou?"
Ezekiel,12,10,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} thou unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; This burden{H4853} concerneth the prince{H5387} in Jerusalem{H3389}, and all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} that are among{H8432} them."
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say{H559}{(H8798)}, I am your sign{H4159}: like as I have done{H6213}{(H8804)}, so shall it be done{H6213}{(H8735)} unto them: they shall remove{H1473} and go{H3212}{(H8799)} into captivity{H7628}."
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the prince{H5387} that is among{H8432} them shall bear{H5375}{(H8799)} upon his shoulder{H3802} in the twilight{H5939}, and shall go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}: they shall dig{H2864}{(H8799)} through the wall{H7023} to carry out{H3318}{(H8687)} thereby: he shall cover{H3680}{(H8762)} his face{H6440}, that{H3282} he see{H7200}{(H8799)} not the ground{H776} with his eyes{H5869}."
Ezekiel,12,13,"My net{H7568} also will I spread{H6566}{(H8804)} upon him, and he shall be taken{H8610}{(H8738)} in my snare{H4686}: and I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} him to Babylon{H894} to the land{H776} of the Chaldeans{H3778}; yet shall he not see{H7200}{(H8799)} it, though he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"And I will scatter{H2219}{(H8762)} toward every wind{H7307} all that are about{H5439} him to help{H5828} him, and all his bands{H102}; and I will draw out{H7324}{(H8686)} the sword{H2719} after{H310} them."
Ezekiel,12,15,"And they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I shall scatter{H6327}{(H8687)} them among the nations{H1471}, and disperse{H2219}{(H8765)} them in the countries{H776}."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will leave{H3498}{(H8689)} a few{H4557} men{H582} of them from the sword{H2719}, from the famine{H7458}, and from the pestilence{H1698}; that they may declare{H5608}{(H8762)} all their abominations{H8441} among the heathen{H1471} whither they come{H935}{(H8804)}; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,12,17,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,12,18,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, eat{H398}{(H8799)} thy bread{H3899} with quaking{H7494}, and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} thy water{H4325} with trembling{H7269} and with carefulness{H1674};"
Ezekiel,12,19,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} unto the people{H5971} of the land{H127}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} of the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and of the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}; They shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} their bread{H3899} with carefulness{H1674}, and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} their water{H4325} with astonishment{H8078}, that her land{H776} may be desolate{H3456}{(H8799)} from all that is therein{H4393}, because of the violence{H2555} of all them that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} therein."
Ezekiel,12,20,"And the cities{H5892} that are inhabited{H3427}{(H8737)} shall be laid waste{H2717}{(H8799)}, and the land{H776} shall be desolate{H8077}; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,12,21,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,12,22,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, what is that proverb{H4912} that ye have in the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The days{H3117} are prolonged{H748}{(H8799)}, and every vision{H2377} faileth{H6}{(H8804)}?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Tell{H559}{(H8798)} them therefore, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will make this proverb{H4912} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)}, and they shall no more use it as a proverb{H4911}{(H8799)} in Israel{H3478}; but say{H1696}{(H8761)} unto them, The days{H3117} are at hand{H7126}{(H8804)}, and the effect{H1697} of every vision{H2377}."
Ezekiel,12,24,For there shall be no more any vain{H7723} vision{H2377} nor flattering{H2509} divination{H4738} within{H8432} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}.
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I am the LORD{H3068}: I will speak{H1696}{(H8762)}, and the word{H1697} that I shall speak{H1696}{(H8762)} shall come to pass{H6213}{(H8735)}; it shall be no more prolonged{H4900}{(H8735)}: for in your days{H3117}, O rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}, will I say{H1696}{(H8762)} the word{H1697}, and will perform{H6213}{(H8804)} it, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,12,26,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,12,27,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, behold, they of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} say{H559}{(H8802)}, The vision{H2377} that he seeth{H2372}{(H8802)} is for many{H7227} days{H3117} to come, and he prophesieth{H5012}{(H8738)} of the times{H6256} that are far{H7350} off."
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say{H559}{(H8798)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; There shall none of my words{H1697} be prolonged{H4900}{(H8735)} any more, but the word{H1697} which I have spoken{H1696}{(H8762)} shall be done{H6213}{(H8735)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,13,1,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,13,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against the prophets{H5030} of Israel{H3478} that prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} thou unto them that prophesy{H5030} out of their own hearts{H3820}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} ye the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068};"
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Woe{H1945} unto the foolish{H5036} prophets{H5030}, that follow{H1980}{(H8802)}{H310} their own spirit{H7307}, and have seen{H7200}{(H8804)} nothing!"
Ezekiel,13,4,"O Israel{H3478}, thy prophets{H5030} are like the foxes{H7776} in the deserts{H2723}."
Ezekiel,13,5,"Ye have not gone up{H5927}{(H8804)} into the gaps{H6556}, neither made up{H1443}{(H8799)} the hedge{H1447} for the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} in the battle{H4421} in the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,13,6,"They have seen{H2372}{(H8804)} vanity{H7723} and lying{H3577} divination{H7081}, saying{H559}{(H8802)}, The LORD{H3068} saith{H5002}{(H8803)}: and the LORD{H3068} hath not sent{H7971}{(H8804)} them: and they have made others to hope{H3176}{(H8765)} that they would confirm{H6965}{(H8763)} the word{H1697}."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Have ye not seen{H2372}{(H8804)} a vain{H7723} vision{H4236}, and have ye not spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} a lying{H3577} divination{H4738}, whereas ye say{H559}{(H8802)}, The LORD{H3068} saith{H5002}{(H8803)} it; albeit I have not spoken{H559}{(H8804)}?"
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because ye have spoken{H1696}{(H8763)} vanity{H7723}, and seen{H2372}{(H8804)} lies{H3577}, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,13,9,"And mine hand{H3027} shall be upon the prophets{H5030} that see{H2374} vanity{H7723}, and that divine{H7080}{(H8802)} lies{H3577}: they shall not be in the assembly{H5475} of my people{H5971}, neither shall they be written{H3789}{(H8735)} in the writing{H3791} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, neither shall they enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,13,10,"Because, even because they have seduced{H2937}{(H8689)} my people{H5971}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Peace{H7965}; and there was no peace{H7965}; and one built up{H1129}{(H8802)} a wall{H2434}, and, lo{H2009}, others daubed{H2902}{(H8802)} it with untempered{H8602} morter:"
Ezekiel,13,11,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} unto them which daub{H2902}{(H8802)} it with untempered{H8602} morter, that it shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)}: there shall be an overflowing{H7857}{(H8802)} shower{H1653}; and ye{H859}, O great hailstones{H417}{H68}, shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)}; and a stormy{H5591} wind{H7307} shall rend{H1234}{(H8762)} it."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Lo, when the wall{H7023} is fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}, shall it not be said{H559}{(H8735)} unto you, Where is the daubing{H2915} wherewith ye have daubed{H2902}{(H8804)} it?"
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will even rend{H1234}{(H8765)} it with a stormy{H5591} wind{H7307} in my fury{H2534}; and there shall be an overflowing{H7857}{(H8802)} shower{H1653} in mine anger{H639}, and great hailstones{H417}{H68} in my fury{H2534} to consume{H3617} it."
Ezekiel,13,14,"So will I break down{H2040}{(H8804)} the wall{H7023} that ye have daubed{H2902}{(H8804)} with untempered{H8602} morter, and bring{H5060}{(H8689)} it down to the ground{H776}, so that the foundation{H3247} thereof shall be discovered{H1540}{(H8738)}, and it shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)}, and ye shall be consumed{H3615}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} thereof: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,13,15,"Thus will I accomplish{H3615}{(H8765)} my wrath{H2534} upon the wall{H7023}, and upon them that have daubed{H2902}{(H8802)} it with untempered{H8602} morter, and will say{H559}{(H8799)} unto you, The wall{H7023} is no more, neither they that daubed{H2902}{(H8802)} it;"
Ezekiel,13,16,"To wit, the prophets{H5030} of Israel{H3478} which prophesy{H5012}{(H8737)} concerning Jerusalem{H3389}, and which see{H2374} visions{H2377} of peace{H7965} for her, and there is no peace{H7965}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,13,17,"Likewise, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} against the daughters{H1323} of thy people{H5971}, which prophesy{H5012}{(H8693)} out of their own heart{H3820}; and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} thou against them,"
Ezekiel,13,18,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Woe{H1945} to the women that sew{H8609}{(H8764)} pillows{H3704} to all armholes{H679}{H3027}, and make{H6213}{(H8802)} kerchiefs{H4555} upon the head{H7218} of every stature{H6967} to hunt{H6679}{(H8780)} souls{H5315}! Will ye hunt{H6679}{(H8779)} the souls{H5315} of my people{H5971}, and will ye save{H2421} the souls{H5315} alive{H2421}{(H8762)} that come unto you?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"And will ye pollute{H2490}{(H8762)} me among my people{H5971} for handfuls{H8168} of barley{H8184} and for pieces{H6595} of bread{H3899}, to slay{H4191}{(H8687)} the souls{H5315} that should not die{H4191}{(H8799)}, and to save{H2421} the souls{H5315} alive{H2421}{(H8763)} that should not live{H2421}{(H8799)}, by your lying{H3576}{(H8763)} to my people{H5971} that hear{H8085}{(H8802)} your lies{H3577}?"
Ezekiel,13,20,"Wherefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I am against your pillows{H3704}, wherewith ye{H859} there hunt{H6679}{(H8781)} the souls{H5315} to make them fly{H6524}{(H8802)}, and I will tear{H7167}{(H8804)} them from your arms{H2220}, and will let the souls{H5315} go{H7971}{(H8765)}, even the souls{H5315} that ye hunt{H6679}{(H8781)} to make them fly{H6524}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,13,21,"Your kerchiefs{H4555} also will I tear{H7167}{(H8804)}, and deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} my people{H5971} out of your hand{H3027}, and they shall be no more in your hand{H3027} to be hunted{H4686}; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because with lies{H8267} ye have made the heart{H3820} of the righteous{H6662} sad{H3512}{(H8687)}, whom I have not made sad{H3510}{(H8689)}; and strengthened{H2388}{(H8763)} the hands{H3027} of the wicked{H7451}, that he should not return{H7725}{(H8800)} from his wicked{H7563} way{H1870}, by promising him life{H2421}{(H8687)}:"
Ezekiel,13,23,"Therefore ye shall see{H2372}{(H8799)} no more vanity{H7723}, nor divine{H7080}{(H8799)} divinations{H7081}: for I will deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} my people{H5971} out of your hand{H3027}: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,14,1,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} certain{H582} of the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} unto me, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me."
Ezekiel,14,2,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,14,3,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, these men{H582} have set up{H5927}{(H8689)} their idols{H1544} in their heart{H3820}, and put{H5414}{(H8804)} the stumblingblock{H4383} of their iniquity{H5771} before{H5227} their face{H6440}: should I be enquired{H1875}{(H8735)} of at all{H1875}{(H8736)} by them?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto them, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Every man{H376} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} that setteth up{H5927}{(H8686)} his idols{H1544} in his heart{H3820}, and putteth{H7760}{(H8799)} the stumblingblock{H4383} of his iniquity{H5771} before{H5227} his face{H6440}, and cometh{H935}{(H8804)} to the prophet{H5030}; I the LORD{H3068} will answer{H6030}{(H8738)} him that cometh{H935}{(H8804)} according to the multitude{H7230} of his idols{H1544};"
Ezekiel,14,5,"That I may take{H8610}{(H8800)} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} in their own heart{H3820}, because they are all estranged{H2114}{(H8738)} from me through their idols{H1544}."

Ezekiel,14,10,And they shall bear{H5375}{(H8804)} the punishment of their iniquity{H5771}: the punishment{H5771} of the prophet{H5030} shall be even as the punishment{H5771} of him that seeketh{H1875}{(H8802)} unto him;

Ezekiel,14,13,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, when the land{H776} sinneth{H2398}{(H8799)} against me by trespassing{H4603}{(H8800)} grievously{H4604}, then will I stretch out{H5186}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} upon it, and will break{H7665}{(H8804)} the staff{H4294} of the bread{H3899} thereof, and will send{H7971}{(H8689)} famine{H7458} upon it, and will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} man{H120} and beast{H929} from it:"
Ezekiel,14,14,"Though these three{H7969} men{H582}, Noah{H5146}, Daniel{H1840}, and Job{H347}, were in it{H8432}, they should deliver{H5337}{(H8762)} but their own souls{H5315} by their righteousness{H6666}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,14,15,"If{H3863} I cause noisome{H7451} beasts{H2416} to pass through{H5674}{(H8686)} the land{H776}, and they spoil{H7921}{(H8765)} it, so that it be desolate{H8077}, that no man may pass through{H5674}{(H8802)} because{H6440} of the beasts{H2416}:"
Ezekiel,14,16,"Though these three{H7969} men{H582} were in it{H8432}, as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, they shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} neither sons{H1121} nor daughters{H1323}; they only shall be delivered{H5337}{(H8735)}, but the land{H776} shall be desolate{H8077}."
Ezekiel,14,17,"Or if I bring{H935}{(H8686)} a sword{H2719} upon that land{H776}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Sword{H2719}, go through{H5674}{(H8799)} the land{H776}; so that I cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} man{H120} and beast{H929} from it:"
Ezekiel,14,18,"Though these three{H7969} men{H582} were in it{H8432}, as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, they shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} neither sons{H1121} nor daughters{H1323}, but they only shall be delivered{H5337}{(H8735)} themselves."
Ezekiel,14,19,"Or if I send{H7971}{(H8762)} a pestilence{H1698} into that land{H776}, and pour out{H8210}{(H8804)} my fury{H2534} upon it in blood{H1818}, to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} from it man{H120} and beast{H929}:"
Ezekiel,14,20,"Though Noah{H5146}, Daniel{H1840}, and Job{H347}, were in it{H8432}, as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, they shall deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} neither son{H1121} nor{H518} daughter{H1323}; they shall but deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} their own souls{H5315} by their righteousness{H6666}."
Ezekiel,14,21,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; How much more when I send{H7971}{(H8765)} my four{H702} sore{H7451} judgments{H8201} upon Jerusalem{H3389}, the sword{H2719}, and the famine{H7458}, and the noisome{H7451} beast{H2416}, and the pestilence{H1698}, to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} from it man{H120} and beast{H929}?"
Ezekiel,14,22,"Yet, behold, therein shall be left{H3498}{(H8738)} a remnant{H6413} that shall be brought forth{H3318}{(H8716)}, both sons{H1121} and daughters{H1323}: behold, they shall come forth{H3318}{(H8802)} unto you, and ye shall see{H7200}{(H8804)} their way{H1870} and their doings{H5949}: and ye shall be comforted{H5162}{(H8738)} concerning the evil{H7451} that I have brought{H935}{(H8689)} upon Jerusalem{H3389}, even concerning all that I have brought{H935}{(H8689)} upon it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"And they shall comfort{H5162}{(H8765)} you, when ye see{H7200}{(H8799)} their ways{H1870} and their doings{H5949}: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I have not done{H6213}{(H8804)} without cause{H2600} all that I have done{H6213}{(H8804)} in it, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,15,1,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,15,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, What is the vine{H1612} tree{H6086} more than any tree{H6086}, or than a branch{H2156} which is among the trees{H6086} of the forest{H3293}?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Shall wood{H6086} be taken{H3947}{(H8714)} thereof to do{H6213}{(H8800)} any work{H4399}? or will men take{H3947}{(H8799)} a pin{H3489} of it to hang{H8518}{(H8800)} any vessel{H3627} thereon?
Ezekiel,15,4,"Behold, it is cast{H5414}{(H8738)} into the fire{H784} for fuel{H402}; the fire{H784} devoureth{H398}{(H8804)} both{H8147} the ends{H7098} of it, and the midst{H8432} of it is burned{H2787}{(H8737)}. Is it meet{H6743}{(H8799)} for any work{H4399}?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Behold, when it was whole{H8549}, it was meet{H6213}{(H8735)} for no work{H4399}: how much less shall it be meet{H6213}{(H8738)} yet for any work{H4399}, when the fire{H784} hath devoured{H398}{(H8804)} it, and it is burned{H2787}{(H8735)}?"
Ezekiel,15,6,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; As the vine{H1612} tree{H6086} among the trees{H6086} of the forest{H3293}, which I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} to the fire{H784} for fuel{H402}, so will I give{H5414}{(H8804)} the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Ezekiel,15,7,"And I will set{H5414}{(H8804)} my face{H6440} against them; they shall go out{H3318}{(H8804)} from one fire{H784}, and another fire{H784} shall devour{H398}{(H8799)} them; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I set{H7760}{(H8800)} my face{H6440} against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,"And I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} the land{H776} desolate{H8077}, because they have committed{H4603}{(H8804)} a trespass{H4604}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,16,1,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,16,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, cause Jerusalem{H3389} to know{H3045}{(H8685)} her abominations{H8441},"
Ezekiel,16,3,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} unto Jerusalem{H3389}; Thy birth{H4351} and thy nativity{H4138} is of the land{H776} of Canaan{H3669}; thy father{H1} was an Amorite{H567}, and thy mother{H517} an Hittite{H2850}."
Ezekiel,16,4,"And as for thy nativity{H4138}, in the day{H3117} thou wast born{H3205}{(H8715)} thy navel{H8270} was not cut{H3772}{(H8795)}, neither wast thou washed{H7364}{(H8795)} in water{H4325} to supple{H4935} thee; thou wast not salted{H4414}{(H8717)} at all{H4414}{(H8715)}, nor swaddled{H2853}{(H8795)} at all{H2853}{(H8715)}."
Ezekiel,16,5,"None eye{H5869} pitied{H2347}{(H8804)} thee, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} any{H259} of these unto thee, to have compassion{H2550}{(H8800)} upon thee; but thou wast cast out{H7993}{(H8714)} in the open{H6440} field{H7704}, to the lothing{H1604} of thy person{H5315}, in the day{H3117} that thou wast born{H3205}{(H8715)}."
Ezekiel,16,6,"And when I passed{H5674}{(H8799)} by thee, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)} thee polluted{H947}{(H8711)} in thine own blood{H1818}, I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee when thou wast in thy blood{H1818}, Live{H2421}{(H8798)}; yea, I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee when thou wast in thy blood{H1818}, Live{H2421}{(H8798)}."
Ezekiel,16,7,"I have caused{H5414}{(H8804)} thee to multiply{H7233} as the bud{H6780} of the field{H7704}, and thou hast increased{H7235}{(H8799)} and waxen great{H1431}{(H8799)}, and thou art come{H935}{(H8799)} to excellent{H5716} ornaments{H5716}: thy breasts{H7699} are fashioned{H3559}{(H8738)}, and thine hair{H8181} is grown{H6779}{(H8765)}, whereas thou wast naked{H5903} and bare{H6181}."
Ezekiel,16,8,"Now when I passed{H5674}{(H8799)} by thee, and looked{H7200}{(H8799)} upon thee, behold, thy time{H6256} was the time{H6256} of love{H1730}; and I spread{H6566}{(H8799)} my skirt{H3671} over thee, and covered{H3680}{(H8762)} thy nakedness{H6172}: yea, I sware{H7650}{(H8735)} unto thee, and entered{H935}{(H8799)} into a covenant{H1285} with thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, and thou becamest mine."
Ezekiel,16,9,"Then washed{H7364}{(H8799)} I thee with water{H4325}; yea, I throughly washed away{H7857}{(H8799)} thy blood{H1818} from thee, and I anointed{H5480}{(H8799)} thee with oil{H8081}."
Ezekiel,16,10,"I clothed{H3847}{(H8686)} thee also with broidered work{H7553}, and shod{H5274}{(H8799)} thee with badgers' skin{H8476}, and I girded{H2280}{(H8799)} thee about with fine linen{H8336}, and I covered{H3680}{(H8762)} thee with silk{H4897}."
Ezekiel,16,11,"I decked{H5710}{(H8799)} thee also with ornaments{H5716}, and I put{H5414}{(H8799)} bracelets{H6781} upon thy hands{H3027}, and a chain{H7242} on thy neck{H1627}."
Ezekiel,16,12,"And I put{H5414}{(H8799)} a jewel{H5141} on thy forehead{H639}, and earrings{H5694} in thine ears{H241}, and a beautiful{H8597} crown{H5850} upon thine head{H7218}."
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus wast thou decked{H5710}{(H8799)} with gold{H2091} and silver{H3701}; and thy raiment{H4403} was of fine linen{H8336}{(H8675)}{H8336}, and silk{H4897}, and broidered work{H7553}; thou didst eat{H398}{(H8804)} fine flour{H5560}, and honey{H1706}, and oil{H8081}: and thou wast exceeding{H3966} beautiful{H3302}{(H8799)}, and thou didst prosper{H6743}{(H8799)} into a kingdom{H4410}."
Ezekiel,16,14,"And thy renown{H8034} went forth{H3318}{(H8799)} among the heathen{H1471} for thy beauty{H3308}: for it was perfect{H3632} through my comeliness{H1926}, which I had put{H7760}{(H8804)} upon thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,16,15,"But thou didst trust{H982}{(H8799)} in thine own beauty{H3308}, and playedst the harlot{H2181}{(H8799)} because of thy renown{H8034}, and pouredst out{H8210}{(H8799)} thy fornications{H8457} on every one that passed by{H5674}{(H8802)}; his it was."
Ezekiel,16,16,"And of thy garments{H899} thou didst take{H3947}{(H8799)}, and deckedst{H6213}{(H8799)} thy high places{H1116} with divers colours{H2921}{(H8803)}, and playedst the harlot{H2181}{(H8799)} thereupon: the like things shall not come{H935}{(H8802)}, neither shall it be so."
Ezekiel,16,17,"Thou hast also taken{H3947}{(H8799)} thy fair{H8597} jewels{H3627} of my gold{H2091} and of my silver{H3701}, which I had given{H5414}{(H8804)} thee, and madest{H6213}{(H8799)} to thyself images{H6754} of men{H2145}, and didst commit whoredom{H2181}{(H8799)} with them,"
Ezekiel,16,18,"And tookest{H3947}{(H8799)} thy broidered{H7553} garments{H899}, and coveredst{H3680}{(H8762)} them: and thou hast set{H5414}{(H8804)} mine oil{H8081} and mine incense{H7004} before{H6440} them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"My meat{H3899} also which I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} thee, fine flour{H5560}, and oil{H8081}, and honey{H1706}, wherewith I fed{H398}{(H8689)} thee, thou hast even set{H5414}{(H8804)} it before{H6440} them for a sweet{H5207} savour{H7381}: and thus it was, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,16,20,"Moreover thou hast taken{H3947}{(H8799)} thy sons{H1121} and thy daughters{H1323}, whom thou hast borne{H3205}{(H8804)} unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed{H2076}{(H8799)} unto them to be devoured{H398}{(H8800)}. Is this of thy whoredoms{H8457} a small matter{H4592},"
Ezekiel,16,21,"That thou hast slain{H7819}{(H8799)} my children{H1121}, and delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} them to cause them to pass through{H5674}{(H8687)} the fire for them?"
Ezekiel,16,22,"And in all thine abominations{H8441} and thy whoredoms{H8457} thou hast not remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} the days{H3117} of thy youth{H5271}, when thou wast naked{H5903} and bare{H6181}, and wast polluted{H947}{(H8711)} in thy blood{H1818}."
Ezekiel,16,23,"And it came to pass after{H310} all thy wickedness{H7451},(woe{H188}, woe{H188} unto thee! saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069};)"
Ezekiel,16,24,"That thou hast also built{H1129}{(H8799)} unto thee an eminent place{H1354}, and hast made{H6213}{(H8799)} thee an high place{H7413} in every street{H7339}."
Ezekiel,16,25,"Thou hast built{H1129}{(H8804)} thy high place{H7413} at every head{H7218} of the way{H1870}, and hast made thy beauty{H3308} to be abhorred{H8581}{(H8762)}, and hast opened{H6589}{(H8762)} thy feet{H7272} to every one that passed by{H5674}{(H8802)}, and multiplied{H7235}{(H8686)} thy whoredoms{H8457}."
Ezekiel,16,26,"Thou hast also committed fornication{H2181}{(H8799)} with the Egyptians{H1121}{H4714} thy neighbours{H7934}, great{H1432} of flesh{H1320}; and hast increased{H7235}{(H8686)} thy whoredoms{H8457}, to provoke me to anger{H3707}{(H8687)}."
Ezekiel,16,27,"Behold, therefore I have stretched out{H5186}{(H8804)} my hand{H3027} over thee, and have diminished{H1639}{(H8799)} thine ordinary{H2706} food, and delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} thee unto the will{H5315} of them that hate{H8130}{(H8802)} thee, the daughters{H1323} of the Philistines{H6430}, which are ashamed{H3637}{(H8737)} of thy lewd{H2154} way{H1870}."
Ezekiel,16,28,"Thou hast played the whore{H2181}{(H8799)} also with the Assyrians{H1121}{H804}, because{H1115} thou wast unsatiable{H7646}{(H8804)}; yea, thou hast played the harlot{H2181}{(H8799)} with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied{H7654}."
Ezekiel,16,29,Thou hast moreover multiplied{H7235}{(H8686)} thy fornication{H8457} in the land{H776} of Canaan{H3667} unto Chaldea{H3778}; and yet thou wast not satisfied{H7646}{(H8804)} herewith{H2063}.
Ezekiel,16,30,"How weak{H535}{(H8802)} is thine heart{H3826}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, seeing thou doest{H6213}{(H8800)} all these things, the work{H4639} of an imperious{H7986} whorish{H2181}{(H8803)} woman{H802};"
Ezekiel,16,31,"In that thou buildest{H1129}{(H8800)} thine eminent place{H1354} in the head{H7218} of every way{H1870}, and makest{H6213}{(H8804)} thine high place{H7413} in every street{H7339}; and hast not been as an harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, in that thou scornest{H7046}{(H8763)} hire{H868};"
Ezekiel,16,32,"But as a wife{H802} that committeth adultery{H5003}{(H8764)}, which taketh{H3947}{(H8799)} strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} instead of her husband{H376}!"
Ezekiel,16,33,"They give{H5414}{(H8799)} gifts{H5078} to all whores{H2181}{(H8802)}: but thou givest{H5414}{(H8804)} thy gifts{H5083} to all thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, and hirest{H7809}{(H8799)} them, that they may come{H935}{(H8800)} unto thee on every side{H5439} for thy whoredom{H8457}."
Ezekiel,16,34,"And the contrary{H2016} is in thee from other women{H802} in thy whoredoms{H8457}, whereas none followeth{H310} thee to commit whoredoms{H2181}{(H8795)}: and in that thou givest{H5414}{(H8800)} a reward{H868}, and no reward{H868} is given{H5414}{(H8738)} unto thee, therefore thou art{H1961}{(H8799)} contrary{H2016}."
Ezekiel,16,35,"Wherefore, O harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because thy filthiness{H5178} was poured out{H8210}{(H8736)}, and thy nakedness{H6172} discovered{H1540}{(H8735)} through thy whoredoms{H8457} with thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, and with all the idols{H1544} of thy abominations{H8441}, and by the blood{H1818} of thy children{H1121}, which thou didst give{H5414}{(H8804)} unto them;"
Ezekiel,16,37,"Behold, therefore I will gather{H6908}{(H8764)} all thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, with whom thou hast taken pleasure{H6149}{(H8804)}, and all them that thou hast loved{H157}{(H8804)}, with all them that thou hast hated{H8130}{(H8804)}; I will even gather{H6908}{(H8765)} them round about{H5439} against thee, and will discover{H1540}{(H8765)} thy nakedness{H6172} unto them, that they may see{H7200}{(H8804)} all thy nakedness{H6172}."
Ezekiel,16,38,"And I will judge{H8199}{(H8804)} thee, as women that break wedlock{H5003}{(H8802)} and shed{H8210}{(H8802)} blood{H1818} are judged{H4941}; and I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee blood{H1818} in fury{H2534} and jealousy{H7068}."
Ezekiel,16,39,"And I will also give{H5414}{(H8804)} thee into their hand{H3027}, and they shall throw down{H2040}{(H8804)} thine eminent place{H1354}, and shall break down{H5422}{(H8765)} thy high places{H7413}: they shall strip{H6584}{(H8689)} thee also of thy clothes{H899}, and shall take{H3947}{(H8804)} thy fair{H8597} jewels{H3627}, and leave{H3240}{(H8689)} thee naked{H5903} and bare{H6181}."
Ezekiel,16,40,"They shall also bring up{H5927}{(H8689)} a company{H6951} against thee, and they shall stone{H7275}{(H8804)} thee with stones{H68}, and thrust thee through{H1333}{(H8765)} with their swords{H2719}."
Ezekiel,16,41,"And they shall burn{H8313}{(H8804)} thine houses{H1004} with fire{H784}, and execute{H6213}{(H8804)} judgments{H8201} upon thee in the sight{H5869} of many{H7227} women{H802}: and I will cause thee to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} from playing the harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}, and thou also shalt give{H5414}{(H8799)} no hire{H868} any more."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So will I make my fury{H2534} toward thee to rest{H5117}{(H8689)}, and my jealousy{H7068} shall depart{H5493}{(H8804)} from thee, and I will be quiet{H8252}{(H8804)}, and will be no more angry{H3707}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because thou hast not remembered{H2142}{(H8804)} the days{H3117} of thy youth{H5271}, but hast fretted{H7264}{(H8799)} me in all these things; behold{H1887}, therefore I also will recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} thy way{H1870} upon thine head{H7218}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}: and thou shalt not commit{H6213}{(H8804)} this lewdness{H2154} above all thine abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,16,44,"Behold, every one that useth proverbs{H4911}{(H8802)} shall use this proverb{H4911}{(H8799)} against thee, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, As is the mother{H517}, so is her daughter{H1323}."
Ezekiel,16,45,"Thou art thy mother's{H517} daughter{H1323}, that lotheth{H1602}{(H8802)} her husband{H376} and her children{H1121}; and thou art the sister{H269} of thy sisters{H269}, which lothed{H1602}{(H8804)} their husbands{H582} and their children{H1121}: your mother{H517} was an Hittite{H2850}, and your father{H1} an Amorite{H567}."
Ezekiel,16,46,"And thine elder{H1419} sister{H269} is Samaria{H8111}, she and her daughters{H1323} that dwell{H3427}{(H8802)} at thy left hand{H8040}: and thy younger{H6996} sister{H269}, that dwelleth{H3427}{(H8802)} at thy right hand{H3225}, is Sodom{H5467} and her daughters{H1323}."
Ezekiel,16,47,"Yet hast thou not walked{H1980}{(H8804)} after their ways{H1870}, nor done{H6213}{(H8804)} after their abominations{H8441}: but, as if that were a very{H6985} little{H4592}{H6962}{(H8804)} thing, thou wast corrupted{H7843}{(H8686)} more than they{H2004} in all thy ways{H1870}."
Ezekiel,16,48,"As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, Sodom{H5467} thy sister{H269} hath not done{H6213}{(H8804)}, she nor her daughters{H1323}, as thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}, thou and thy daughters{H1323}."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Behold, this was the iniquity{H5771} of thy sister{H269} Sodom{H5467}, pride{H1347}, fulness{H7653} of bread{H3899}, and abundance{H7962} of idleness{H8252}{(H8687)} was in her and in her daughters{H1323}, neither did she strengthen{H2388}{(H8689)} the hand{H3027} of the poor{H6041} and needy{H34}."
Ezekiel,16,50,"And they were haughty{H1361}{(H8799)}, and committed{H6213}{(H8799)} abomination{H8441} before{H6440} me: therefore I took them away{H5493}{(H8686)} as I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} good."
Ezekiel,16,51,"Neither hath Samaria{H8111} committed{H2398}{(H8804)} half{H2677} of thy sins{H2403}; but thou hast multiplied{H7235}{(H8686)} thine abominations{H8441} more than they{H2007}, and hast justified{H6663}{(H8762)} thy sisters{H269} in all thine abominations{H8441} which thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,16,52,"Thou also, which hast judged{H6419}{(H8765)} thy sisters{H269}, bear{H5375}{(H8798)} thine own shame{H3639} for thy sins{H2403} that thou hast committed more abominable{H8581}{(H8689)} than they{H2004}: they are more righteous{H6663}{(H8799)} than thou: yea, be thou confounded{H954}{(H8798)} also, and bear{H5375}{(H8798)} thy shame{H3639}, in that thou hast justified{H6663}{(H8763)} thy sisters{H269}."
Ezekiel,16,53,"When I shall bring again{H7725}{(H8804)} their captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622}, the captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622} of Sodom{H5467} and her daughters{H1323}, and the captivity{H7622}{(H8676)}{H7622} of Samaria{H8111} and her daughters{H1323}, then will I bring again the captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622} of thy captives{H7622} in the midst{H8432} of them:"
Ezekiel,16,54,"That thou mayest bear{H5375}{(H8799)} thine own shame{H3639}, and mayest be confounded{H3637}{(H8738)} in all that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}, in that thou art a comfort{H5162}{(H8763)} unto them."
Ezekiel,16,55,"When thy sisters{H269}, Sodom{H5467} and her daughters{H1323}, shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} to their former estate{H6927}, and Samaria{H8111} and her daughters{H1323} shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} to their former estate{H6927}, then thou and thy daughters{H1323} shall return{H7725}{(H8799)} to your former estate{H6927}."
Ezekiel,16,56,"For thy sister{H269} Sodom{H5467} was not mentioned{H8052} by thy mouth{H6310} in the day{H3117} of thy pride{H1347},"
Ezekiel,16,57,"Before thy wickedness{H7451} was discovered{H1540}{(H8735)}, as at the time{H6256} of thy reproach{H2781} of the daughters{H1323} of Syria{H758}, and all that are round about{H5439} her, the daughters{H1323} of the Philistines{H6430}, which despise{H7590}{(H8801)} thee round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,16,58,"Thou hast borne{H5375}{(H8804)} thy lewdness{H2154} and thine abominations{H8441}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,16,59,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will even deal{H6213}{(H8804)} with thee as thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}, which hast despised{H959}{(H8804)} the oath{H423} in breaking{H6565}{(H8687)} the covenant{H1285}."
Ezekiel,16,60,"Nevertheless I will remember{H2142}{(H8804)} my covenant{H1285} with thee in the days{H3117} of thy youth{H5271}, and I will establish{H6965}{(H8689)} unto thee an everlasting{H5769} covenant{H1285}."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then thou shalt remember{H2142}{(H8804)} thy ways{H1870}, and be ashamed{H3637}{(H8738)}, when thou shalt receive{H3947}{(H8800)} thy sisters{H269}, thine elder{H1419} and thy younger{H6996}: and I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} them unto thee for daughters{H1323}, but not by thy covenant{H1285}."
Ezekiel,16,62,And I will establish{H6965}{(H8689)} my covenant{H1285} with thee; and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}:
Ezekiel,16,63,"That thou mayest remember{H2142}{(H8799)}, and be confounded{H954}{(H8804)}, and never open{H6610} thy mouth{H6310} any more because{H6440} of thy shame{H3639}, when I am pacified{H3722}{(H8763)} toward thee for all that thou hast done{H6213}{(H8804)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."

Ezekiel,17,3,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; A great{H1419} eagle{H5404} with great{H1419} wings{H3671}, longwinged{H83}{H750}, full{H4392} of feathers{H5133}, which had divers colours{H7553}, came{H935}{(H8804)} unto Lebanon{H3844}, and took{H3947}{(H8799)} the highest branch{H6788} of the cedar{H730}:"
Ezekiel,17,4,"He cropped off{H6998}{(H8804)} the top{H7218} of his young twigs{H3242}, and carried{H935}{(H8686)} it into a land{H776} of traffick{H3667}; he set{H7760}{(H8804)} it in a city{H5892} of merchants{H7402}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,17,5,"He took{H3947}{(H8799)} also of the seed{H2233} of the land{H776}, and planted{H5414}{(H8799)} it in a fruitful{H2233} field{H7704}; he placed{H3947}{(H8804)} it by great{H7227} waters{H4325}, and set{H7760}{(H8804)} it as a willow tree{H6851}."
Ezekiel,17,6,"And it grew{H6779}{(H8799)}, and became a spreading{H5628}{(H8802)} vine{H1612} of low{H8217} stature{H6967}, whose branches{H1808} turned{H6437}{(H8800)} toward him, and the roots{H8328} thereof were under him: so it became a vine{H1612}, and brought forth{H6213}{(H8799)} branches{H905}, and shot{H7971}{(H8762)} forth sprigs{H6288}."
Ezekiel,17,7,"There was also another{H259} great{H1419} eagle{H5404} with great{H1419} wings{H3671} and many{H7227} feathers{H5133}: and, behold, this vine{H1612} did bend{H3719}{(H8804)} her roots{H8328} toward him, and shot forth{H7971}{(H8765)} her branches{H1808} toward him, that he might water{H8248}{(H8687)} it by the furrows{H6170} of her plantation{H4302}."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It was planted{H8362}{(H8803)} in a good{H2896} soil{H7704} by great{H7227} waters{H4325}, that it might bring forth{H6213}{(H8800)} branches{H6057}, and that it might bear{H5375}{(H8800)} fruit{H6529}, that it might be a goodly{H155} vine{H1612}."
Ezekiel,17,9,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} thou, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Shall it prosper{H6743}{(H8799)}? shall he not pull up{H5423}{(H8762)} the roots{H8328} thereof, and cut off{H7082}{(H8779)} the fruit{H6529} thereof, that it wither{H3001}{(H8804)}? it shall wither{H3001}{(H8799)} in all the leaves{H2964} of her spring{H6780}, even without great{H1419} power{H2220} or many{H7227} people{H5971} to pluck it up{H5375}{(H8800)} by the roots{H8328} thereof."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Yea, behold, being planted{H8362}{(H8803)}, shall it prosper{H6743}{(H8799)}? shall it not utterly{H3001}{(H8800)} wither{H3001}{(H8799)}, when the east{H6921} wind{H7307} toucheth{H5060}{(H8800)} it? it shall wither{H3001}{(H8799)} in the furrows{H6170} where it grew{H6780}."
Ezekiel,17,11,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,17,12,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} now to the rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}, Know{H3045}{(H8804)} ye not what these things mean? tell{H559}{(H8798)} them, Behold, the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} is come{H935}{(H8802)} to Jerusalem{H3389}, and hath taken{H3947}{(H8799)} the king{H4428} thereof, and the princes{H8269} thereof, and led{H935}{(H8686)} them with him to Babylon{H894};"
Ezekiel,17,13,"And hath taken{H3947}{(H8799)} of the king's{H4410} seed{H2233}, and made{H3772}{(H8799)} a covenant{H1285} with him, and hath taken{H935}{(H8686)} an oath{H423} of him: he hath also taken{H3947}{(H8804)} the mighty{H352} of the land{H776}:"
Ezekiel,17,14,"That the kingdom{H4467} might be base{H8217}, that it might not lift itself up{H5375}{(H8692)}, but that by keeping{H8104}{(H8800)} of his covenant{H1285} it might stand{H5975}{(H8800)}."
Ezekiel,17,15,"But he rebelled{H4775}{(H8799)} against him in sending{H7971}{(H8800)} his ambassadors{H4397} into Egypt{H4714}, that they might give{H5414}{(H8800)} him horses{H5483} and much{H7227} people{H5971}. Shall he prosper{H6743}{(H8799)}? shall he escape{H4422}{(H8735)} that doeth{H6213}{(H8802)} such things? or shall he break{H6565}{(H8689)} the covenant{H1285}, and be delivered{H4422}{(H8738)}?"
Ezekiel,17,16,"As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, surely in the place{H4725} where the king{H4428} dwelleth that made him king{H4427}{(H8688)}, whose oath{H423} he despised{H959}{(H8804)}, and whose covenant{H1285} he brake{H6565}{(H8689)}, even with him in the midst{H8432} of Babylon{H894} he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Neither shall Pharaoh{H6547} with his mighty{H1419} army{H2428} and great{H7227} company{H6951} make{H6213}{(H8799)} for him in the war{H4421}, by casting up{H8210}{(H8800)} mounts{H5550}, and building{H1129}{(H8800)} forts{H1785}, to cut off{H3772}{(H8687)} many{H7227} persons{H5315}:"
Ezekiel,17,18,"Seeing he despised{H959}{(H8804)} the oath{H423} by breaking{H6565}{(H8687)} the covenant{H1285}, when, lo, he had given{H5414}{(H8804)} his hand{H3027}, and hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} all these things, he shall not escape{H4422}{(H8735)}."
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; As I live{H2416}, surely mine oath{H423} that he hath despised{H959}{(H8804)}, and my covenant{H1285} that he hath broken{H6331}{(H8689)}, even it will I recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} upon his own head{H7218}."
Ezekiel,17,20,"And I will spread{H6566}{(H8804)} my net{H7568} upon him, and he shall be taken{H8610}{(H8738)} in my snare{H4686}, and I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} him to Babylon{H894}, and will plead{H8199}{(H8738)} with him there for his trespass{H4603}{(H8804)} that he hath trespassed{H4604} against me."

Ezekiel,18,14,"Now, lo, if he beget{H3205}{(H8689)} a son{H1121}, that seeth{H7200}{(H8799)} all his father's{H1} sins{H2403} which he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)}, and considereth{H7200}{(H8799)}, and doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} not such like{H2004},"
Ezekiel,18,15,"That hath not eaten{H398}{(H8804)} upon the mountains{H2022}, neither hath lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} his eyes{H5869} to the idols{H1544} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, hath not defiled{H2930}{(H8765)} his neighbour's{H7453} wife{H802},"
Ezekiel,18,16,"Neither hath oppressed{H3238}{(H8689)} any{H376}, hath not withholden{H2254}{(H8804)} the pledge{H2258}, neither hath spoiled{H1497}{(H8804)} by violence{H1500}, but hath given{H5414}{(H8804)} his bread{H3899} to the hungry{H7457}, and hath covered{H3680}{(H8765)} the naked{H5903} with a garment{H899},"
Ezekiel,18,17,"That hath taken off{H7725}{(H8689)} his hand{H3027} from the poor{H6041}, that hath not received{H3947}{(H8804)} usury{H5392} nor increase{H8636}, hath executed{H6213}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941}, hath walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in my statutes{H2708}; he shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)} for the iniquity{H5771} of his father{H1}, he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,18,"As for his father{H1}, because he cruelly{H6233} oppressed{H6231}{(H8804)}, spoiled{H1497}{(H8804)} his brother{H251} by violence{H1499}, and did{H6213}{(H8804)} that which is not good{H2896} among{H8432} his people{H5971}, lo, even he shall die{H4191}{(H8801)} in his iniquity{H5771}."
Ezekiel,18,19,"Yet say{H559}{(H8804)} ye, Why? doth not the son{H1121} bear{H5375}{(H8804)} the iniquity{H5771} of the father{H1}? When the son{H1121} hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} that which is lawful{H4941} and right{H6666}, and hath kept{H8104}{(H8804)} all my statutes{H2708}, and hath done{H6213}{(H8799)} them, he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The soul{H5315} that sinneth{H2398}{(H8802)}, it shall die{H4191}{(H8799)}. The son{H1121} shall not bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the iniquity{H5771} of the father{H1}, neither shall the father{H1} bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the iniquity{H5771} of the son{H1121}: the righteousness{H6666} of the righteous{H6662} shall be upon him, and the wickedness{H7564} of the wicked{H7563} shall be upon him."
Ezekiel,18,21,"But if the wicked{H7563} will turn{H7725}{(H8799)} from all his sins{H2403} that he hath committed{H6213}{(H8804)}, and keep{H8104}{(H8804)} all my statutes{H2708}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} that which is lawful{H4941} and right{H6666}, he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}, he shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,22,"All his transgressions{H6588} that he hath committed{H6213}{(H8804)}, they shall not be mentioned{H2142}{(H8735)} unto him: in his righteousness{H6666} that he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} he shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,23,"Have I any pleasure{H2654}{(H8799)} at all{H2654}{(H8800)} that the wicked{H7563} should die{H4194}? saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}: and not that he should return{H7725}{(H8800)} from his ways{H1870}, and live{H2421}{(H8804)}?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"But when the righteous{H6662} turneth away{H7725}{(H8800)} from his righteousness{H6666}, and committeth{H6213}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}, and doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} according to all the abominations{H8441} that the wicked{H7563} man doeth{H6213}{(H8804)}, shall he live{H2425}{(H8804)}? All his righteousness{H6666} that he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} shall not be mentioned{H2142}{(H8735)}: in his trespass{H4603}{(H8804)} that he hath trespassed{H4604}, and in his sin{H2403} that he hath sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, in them shall he die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,25,"Yet ye say{H559}{(H8804)}, The way{H1870} of the Lord{H136} is not equal{H8505}{(H8735)}. Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} now, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; Is not my way{H1870} equal{H8505}{(H8735)}? are not your ways{H1870} unequal{H8505}{(H8735)}?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a righteous{H6662} man turneth away{H7725}{(H8800)} from his righteousness{H6666}, and committeth{H6213}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}, and dieth{H4191}{(H8804)} in them; for his iniquity{H5766} that he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} shall he die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when the wicked{H7563} man turneth away{H7725}{(H8800)} from his wickedness{H7564} that he hath committed{H6213}{(H8804)}, and doeth{H6213}{(H8799)} that which is lawful{H4941} and right{H6666}, he shall save{H2421} his soul{H5315} alive{H2421}{(H8762)}."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considereth{H7200}{(H8799)}, and turneth away{H7725}{(H8799)} from all his transgressions{H6588} that he hath committed{H6213}{(H8804)}, he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}, he shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet saith{H559}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, The way{H1870} of the Lord{H136} is not equal{H8505}{(H8735)}. O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, are not my ways{H1870} equal{H8505}{(H8735)}? are not your ways{H1870} unequal{H8505}{(H8735)}?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"Therefore I will judge{H8199}{(H8799)} you, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, every one{H376} according to his ways{H1870}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}. Repent{H7725}{(H8798)}, and turn{H7725}{(H8685)} yourselves from all your transgressions{H6588}; so iniquity{H5771} shall not be your ruin{H4383}."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away{H7993}{(H8685)} from you all your transgressions{H6588}, whereby ye have transgressed{H6586}{(H8804)}; and make{H6213}{(H8798)} you a new{H2319} heart{H3820} and a new{H2319} spirit{H7307}: for why will ye die{H4191}{(H8799)}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure{H2654}{(H8799)} in the death{H4194} of him that dieth{H4191}{(H8801)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}: wherefore turn{H7725}{(H8685)} yourselves, and live{H2421}{(H8798)} ye."
Ezekiel,19,1,"Moreover take thou up{H5375}{(H8798)} a lamentation{H7015} for the princes{H5387} of Israel{H3478},"
Ezekiel,19,2,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, What is thy mother{H517}? A lioness{H3833}: she lay down{H7257}{(H8804)} among lions{H738}, she nourished{H7235}{(H8765)} her whelps{H1482} among{H8432} young lions{H3715}."
Ezekiel,19,3,"And she brought up{H5927}{(H8686)} one{H259} of her whelps{H1482}: it became a young lion{H3715}, and it learned{H3925}{(H8799)} to catch{H2963}{(H8800)} the prey{H2964}; it devoured{H398}{(H8804)} men{H120}."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations{H1471} also heard{H8085}{(H8799)} of him; he was taken{H8610}{(H8738)} in their pit{H7845}, and they brought{H935}{(H8686)} him with chains{H2397} unto the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Ezekiel,19,5,"Now when she saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that she had waited{H3176}{(H8738)}, and her hope{H8615} was lost{H6}{(H8804)}, then she took{H3947}{(H8799)} another{H259} of her whelps{H1482}, and made{H7760}{(H8804)} him a young lion{H3715}."
Ezekiel,19,6,"And he went up and down{H1980}{(H8691)} among{H8432} the lions{H738}, he became a young lion{H3715}, and learned{H3925}{(H8799)} to catch{H2963}{(H8800)} the prey{H2964}, and devoured{H398}{(H8804)} men{H120}."
Ezekiel,19,7,"And he knew{H3045}{(H8799)} their desolate palaces{H490}, and he laid waste{H2717}{(H8689)} their cities{H5892}; and the land{H776} was desolate{H3456}{(H8799)}, and the fulness{H4393} thereof, by the noise{H6963} of his roaring{H7581}."
Ezekiel,19,8,"Then the nations{H1471} set{H5414}{(H8799)} against him on every side{H5439} from the provinces{H4082}, and spread{H6566}{(H8799)} their net{H7568} over him: he was taken{H8610}{(H8738)} in their pit{H7845}."
Ezekiel,19,9,"And they put{H5414}{(H8799)} him in ward{H5474} in chains{H2397}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} him to the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}: they brought{H935}{(H8686)} him into holds{H4685}, that his voice{H6963} should no more be heard{H8085}{(H8735)} upon the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Thy mother{H517} is like a vine{H1612} in thy blood{H1818}{(H8676)}{H1818}, planted{H8362}{(H8803)} by the waters{H4325}: she was fruitful{H6509}{(H8802)} and full of branches{H6058} by reason of many{H7227} waters{H4325}."
Ezekiel,19,11,"And she had strong{H5797} rods{H4294} for the sceptres{H7626} of them that bare rule{H4910}{(H8802)}, and her stature{H6967} was exalted{H1361}{(H8799)} among the thick branches{H5688}, and she appeared{H7200}{(H8735)} in her height{H1363} with the multitude{H7230} of her branches{H1808}."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked up{H5428}{(H8714)} in fury{H2534}, she was cast down{H7993}{(H8717)} to the ground{H776}, and the east{H6921} wind{H7307} dried up{H3001}{(H8689)} her fruit{H6529}: her strong{H5797} rods{H4294} were broken{H6561}{(H8694)} and withered{H3001}{(H8804)}; the fire{H784} consumed{H398}{(H8804)} them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she is planted{H8362}{(H8803)} in the wilderness{H4057}, in a dry{H6723} and thirsty{H6772} ground{H776}."
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire{H784} is gone out{H3318}{(H8799)} of a rod{H4294} of her branches{H905}, which hath devoured{H398}{(H8804)} her fruit{H6529}, so that she hath no strong{H5797} rod{H4294} to be a sceptre{H7626} to rule{H4910}{(H8800)}. This is a lamentation{H7015}, and shall be for a lamentation{H7015}."
Ezekiel,20,1,"And it came to pass in the seventh{H7637} year{H8141}, in the fifth{H2549} month, the tenth{H6218} day of the month{H2320}, that certain{H582} of the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8804)} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of the LORD{H3068}, and sat{H3427}{(H8799)} before{H6440} me."
Ezekiel,20,2,"Then came the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,20,3,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto the elders{H2205} of Israel{H3478}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Are ye come{H935}{(H8802)} to enquire{H1875}{(H8800)} of me? As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, I will not be enquired{H1875}{(H8735)} of by you."
Ezekiel,20,4,"Wilt thou judge{H8199}{(H8799)} them, son{H1121} of man{H120}, wilt thou judge{H8199}{(H8799)} them? cause them to know{H3045}{(H8685)} the abominations{H8441} of their fathers{H1}:"
Ezekiel,20,5,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; In the day{H3117} when I chose{H977}{(H8800)} Israel{H3478}, and lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine hand{H3027} unto the seed{H2233} of the house{H1004} of Jacob{H3290}, and made myself known{H3045}{(H8735)} unto them in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, when I lifted{H5375}{(H8799)} up mine hand{H3027} unto them, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430};"
Ezekiel,20,6,"In the day{H3117} that I lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} unto them, to bring them forth{H3318}{(H8687)} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} into a land{H776} that I had espied{H8446}{(H8804)} for them, flowing{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}, which is the glory{H6643} of all lands{H776}:"
Ezekiel,20,7,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I unto them, Cast ye away{H7993}{(H8685)} every man{H376} the abominations{H8251} of his eyes{H5869}, and defile{H2930}{(H8691)} not yourselves with the idols{H1544} of Egypt{H4714}: I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled{H4784}{(H8686)} against me, and would{H14}{(H8804)} not hearken{H8085}{(H8800)} unto me: they did not every man{H376} cast away{H7993}{(H8689)} the abominations{H8251} of their eyes{H5869}, neither did they forsake{H5800}{(H8804)} the idols{H1544} of Egypt{H4714}: then I said{H559}{(H8799)}, I will pour out{H8210}{(H8800)} my fury{H2534} upon them, to accomplish{H3615}{(H8763)} my anger{H639} against them in the midst{H8432} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} for my name's{H8034} sake, that it should not be polluted{H2490}{(H8736)} before{H5869} the heathen{H1471}, among{H8432} whom they were, in whose sight{H5869} I made myself known{H3045}{(H8738)} unto them, in bringing them forth{H3318}{(H8687)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Ezekiel,20,10,"Wherefore I caused them to go forth{H3318}{(H8686)} out of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} them into the wilderness{H4057}."
Ezekiel,20,11,"And I gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them my statutes{H2708}, and shewed{H3045}{(H8689)} them my judgments{H4941}, which if a man{H120} do{H6213}{(H8799)}, he shall even live{H2425}{(H8804)} in them."
Ezekiel,20,12,"Moreover also I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} them my sabbaths{H7676}, to be a sign{H226} between me and them, that they might know{H3045}{(H8800)} that I am the LORD{H3068} that sanctify{H6942}{(H8764)} them."
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} rebelled{H4784}{(H8686)} against me in the wilderness{H4057}: they walked{H1980}{(H8804)} not in my statutes{H2708}, and they despised{H3988}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941}, which if a man{H120} do{H6213}{(H8799)}, he shall even live{H2425}{(H8804)} in them; and my sabbaths{H7676} they greatly{H3966} polluted{H2490}{(H8765)}: then I said{H559}{(H8799)}, I would pour out{H8210}{(H8800)} my fury{H2534} upon them in the wilderness{H4057}, to consume{H3615}{(H8763)} them."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} for my name's{H8034} sake, that it should not be polluted{H2490}{(H8736)} before{H5869} the heathen{H1471}, in whose sight{H5869} I brought them out{H3318}{(H8689)}."
Ezekiel,20,15,"Yet also I lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} my hand{H3027} unto them in the wilderness{H4057}, that I would not bring{H935}{(H8687)} them into the land{H776} which I had given{H5414}{(H8804)} them, flowing{H2100}{(H8802)} with milk{H2461} and honey{H1706}, which is the glory{H6643} of all lands{H776};"
Ezekiel,20,16,"Because they despised{H3988}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941}, and walked{H1980}{(H8804)} not in my statutes{H2708}, but polluted{H2490}{(H8765)} my sabbaths{H7676}: for their heart{H3820} went{H1980}{(H8802)} after{H310} their idols{H1544}."
Ezekiel,20,17,"Nevertheless mine eye{H5869} spared{H2347}{(H8799)} them from destroying{H7843}{(H8763)} them, neither did I make{H6213}{(H8804)} an end{H3617} of them in the wilderness{H4057}."
Ezekiel,20,18,"But I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto their children{H1121} in the wilderness{H4057}, Walk{H3212}{(H8799)} ye not in the statutes{H2706} of your fathers{H1}, neither observe{H8104}{(H8799)} their judgments{H4941}, nor defile{H2930}{(H8691)} yourselves with their idols{H1544}:"
Ezekiel,20,19,"I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}; walk{H3212}{(H8798)} in my statutes{H2708}, and keep{H8104}{(H8798)} my judgments{H4941}, and do{H6213}{(H8798)} them;"
Ezekiel,20,20,"And hallow{H6942}{(H8761)} my sabbaths{H7676}; and they shall be a sign{H226} between me and you, that ye may know{H3045}{(H8800)} that I am the LORD{H3068} your God{H430}."
Ezekiel,20,21,"Notwithstanding the children{H1121} rebelled{H4784}{(H8686)} against me: they walked{H1980}{(H8804)} not in my statutes{H2708}, neither kept{H8104}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941} to do{H6213}{(H8800)} them, which if a man{H120} do{H6213}{(H8799)}, he shall even live{H2425}{(H8804)} in them; they polluted{H2490}{(H8765)} my sabbaths{H7676}: then I said{H559}{(H8799)}, I would pour out{H8210}{(H8800)} my fury{H2534} upon them, to accomplish{H3615}{(H8763)} my anger{H639} against them in the wilderness{H4057}."
Ezekiel,20,22,"Nevertheless I withdrew{H7725}{(H8689)} mine hand{H3027}, and wrought{H6213}{(H8799)} for my name's{H8034} sake, that it should not be polluted{H2490}{(H8736)} in the sight{H5869} of the heathen{H1471}, in whose sight{H5869} I brought them forth{H3318}{(H8689)}."
Ezekiel,20,23,"I lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} unto them also in the wilderness{H4057}, that I would scatter{H6327}{(H8687)} them among the heathen{H1471}, and disperse{H2219}{(H8763)} them through the countries{H776};"
Ezekiel,20,24,"Because they had not executed{H6213}{(H8804)} my judgments{H4941}, but had despised{H3988}{(H8804)} my statutes{H2708}, and had polluted{H2490}{(H8765)} my sabbaths{H7676}, and their eyes{H5869} were after{H310} their fathers{H1}' idols{H1544}."
Ezekiel,20,25,"Wherefore I gave{H5414}{(H8804)} them also statutes{H2706} that were not good{H2896}, and judgments{H4941} whereby they should not live{H2421}{(H8799)};"
Ezekiel,20,26,"And I polluted{H2930}{(H8762)} them in their own gifts{H4979}, in that they caused to pass through{H5674}{(H8687)} the fire all that openeth{H6363} the womb{H7356}, that I might make them desolate{H8074}{(H8686)}, to the end that they might know{H3045}{(H8799)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,20,27,"Therefore, son{H1121} of man{H120}, speak{H1696}{(H8761)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Yet in this your fathers{H1} have blasphemed{H1442}{(H8765)} me, in that they have committed{H4603}{(H8800)} a trespass{H4604} against me."
Ezekiel,20,28,"For when I had brought{H935}{(H8686)} them into the land{H776}, for the which I lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} it to them, then they saw{H7200}{(H8799)} every high{H7311}{(H8802)} hill{H1389}, and all the thick{H5687} trees{H6086}, and they offered{H2076}{(H8799)} there their sacrifices{H2077}, and there they presented{H5414}{(H8799)} the provocation{H3708} of their offering{H7133}: there also they made{H7760}{(H8799)} their sweet{H5207} savour{H7381}, and poured out{H5258}{(H8686)} there their drink offerings{H5262}."
Ezekiel,20,29,"Then I said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, What is the high place{H1116} whereunto ye go{H935}{(H8802)}? And the name{H8034} thereof is called{H7121}{(H8735)} Bamah{H1117} unto this day{H3117}."
Ezekiel,20,30,"Wherefore say{H559}{(H8798)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Are ye polluted{H2930}{(H8737)} after the manner{H1870} of your fathers{H1}? and commit ye whoredom{H2181}{(H8802)} after{H310} their abominations{H8251}?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"For when ye offer{H5375}{(H8800)} your gifts{H4979}, when ye make your sons{H1121} to pass through{H5674}{(H8687)} the fire{H784}, ye pollute{H2930}{(H8737)} yourselves with all your idols{H1544}, even unto this day{H3117}: and shall I be enquired{H1875}{(H8735)} of by you, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}? As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, I will not be enquired{H1875}{(H8735)} of by you."
Ezekiel,20,32,"And that which cometh{H5927}{(H8802)} into your mind{H7307} shall not be at all, that ye say{H559}{(H8802)}, We will be{H1961}{(H8799)} as the heathen{H1471}, as the families{H4940} of the countries{H776}, to serve{H8334}{(H8763)} wood{H6086} and stone{H68}."
Ezekiel,20,33,"As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, surely with a mighty{H2389} hand{H3027}, and with a stretched out{H5186}{(H8803)} arm{H2220}, and with fury{H2534} poured out{H8210}{(H8803)}, will I rule{H4427}{(H8799)} over you:"
Ezekiel,20,34,"And I will bring you out{H3318}{(H8689)} from the people{H5971}, and will gather{H6908}{(H8765)} you out of the countries{H776} wherein ye are scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}, with a mighty{H2389} hand{H3027}, and with a stretched out{H5186}{(H8803)} arm{H2220}, and with fury{H2534} poured out{H8210}{(H8803)}."
Ezekiel,20,35,"And I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} you into the wilderness{H4057} of the people{H5971}, and there will I plead{H8199}{(H8738)} with you face{H6440} to face{H6440}."
Ezekiel,20,36,"Like as I pleaded{H8199}{(H8738)} with your fathers{H1} in the wilderness{H4057} of the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}, so will I plead{H8199}{(H8735)} with you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,20,37,"And I will cause you to pass{H5674}{(H8689)} under the rod{H7626}, and I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} you into the bond{H4562} of the covenant{H1285}:"
Ezekiel,20,38,"And I will purge out{H1305}{(H8804)} from among you the rebels{H4775}{(H8802)}, and them that transgress{H6586}{(H8802)} against me: I will bring them forth{H3318}{(H8686)} out of the country{H776} where they sojourn{H4033}, and they shall not enter{H935}{(H8799)} into the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,20,39,"As for you, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Go{H3212}{(H8798)} ye, serve{H5647}{(H8798)} ye every one{H376} his idols{H1544}, and hereafter{H310} also, if ye will not hearken{H8085}{(H8802)} unto me: but pollute{H2490}{(H8762)} ye my holy{H6944} name{H8034} no more with your gifts{H4979}, and with your idols{H1544}."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For in mine holy{H6944} mountain{H2022}, in the mountain{H2022} of the height{H4791} of Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, there shall all the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, all of them in the land{H776}, serve{H5647}{(H8799)} me: there will I accept{H7521}{(H8799)} them, and there will I require{H1875}{(H8799)} your offerings{H8641}, and the firstfruits{H7225} of your oblations{H4864}, with all your holy things{H6944}."
Ezekiel,20,41,"I will accept{H7521}{(H8799)} you with your sweet{H5207} savour{H7381}, when I bring you out{H3318}{(H8687)} from the people{H5971}, and gather{H6908}{(H8765)} you out of the countries{H776} wherein ye have been scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}; and I will be sanctified{H6942}{(H8738)} in you before{H5869} the heathen{H1471}."
Ezekiel,20,42,"And ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I shall bring{H935}{(H8687)} you into the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}, into the country{H776} for the which I lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} it to your fathers{H1}."
Ezekiel,20,43,"And there shall ye remember{H2142}{(H8804)} your ways{H1870}, and all your doings{H5949}, wherein ye have been defiled{H2930}{(H8738)}; and ye shall lothe{H6962}{(H8738)} yourselves in your own sight{H6440} for all your evils{H7451} that ye have committed{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,20,44,"And ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I have wrought{H6213}{(H8800)} with you for my name's{H8034} sake, not according to your wicked{H7451} ways{H1870}, nor according to your corrupt{H7843}{(H8737)} doings{H5949}, O ye house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,20,45,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,20,46,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} toward{H1870} the south{H8486}, and drop{H5197}{(H8685)} thy word toward the south{H1864}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against the forest{H3293} of the south{H5045} field{H7704};"
Ezekiel,20,47,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} to the forest{H3293} of the south{H5045}, Hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I will kindle{H3341}{(H8688)} a fire{H784} in thee, and it shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} every green{H3892} tree{H6086} in thee, and every dry{H3002} tree{H6086}: the flaming{H3852} flame{H7957} shall not be quenched{H3518}{(H8799)}, and all faces{H6440} from the south{H5045} to the north{H6828} shall be burned{H6866}{(H8738)} therein."
Ezekiel,20,48,And all flesh{H1320} shall see{H7200}{(H8804)} that I the LORD{H3068} have kindled{H1197}{(H8765)} it: it shall not be quenched{H3518}{(H8799)}.
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I, Ah{H162} Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}! they say{H559}{(H8802)} of me, Doth he not speak{H4911}{(H8764)} parables{H4912}?"
Ezekiel,21,1,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,21,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} toward Jerusalem{H3389}, and drop{H5197}{(H8685)} thy word toward the holy places{H4720}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against the land{H127} of Israel{H3478},"
Ezekiel,21,3,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} to the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth{H3318}{(H8689)} my sword{H2719} out of his sheath{H8593}, and will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} from thee the righteous{H6662} and the wicked{H7563}."
Ezekiel,21,4,"Seeing{H3282} then that I will cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} from thee the righteous{H6662} and the wicked{H7563}, therefore shall my sword{H2719} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of his sheath{H8593} against all flesh{H1320} from the south{H5045} to the north{H6828}:"
Ezekiel,21,5,That all flesh{H1320} may know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I the LORD{H3068} have drawn forth{H3318}{(H8689)} my sword{H2719} out of his sheath{H8593}: it shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)} any more.
Ezekiel,21,6,"Sigh{H584}{(H8734)} therefore, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, with the breaking{H7670} of thy loins{H4975}; and with bitterness{H4814} sigh{H584}{(H8735)} before their eyes{H5869}."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And it shall be, when they say{H559}{(H8799)} unto thee, Wherefore sighest{H584}{(H8737)} thou? that thou shalt answer{H559}{(H8804)}, For the tidings{H8052}; because it cometh{H935}{(H8802)}: and every heart{H3820} shall melt{H4549}{(H8738)}, and all hands{H3027} shall be feeble{H7503}{(H8804)}, and every spirit{H7307} shall faint{H3543}{(H8765)}, and all knees{H1290} shall be weak{H3212}{(H8799)} as water{H4325}: behold, it cometh{H935}{(H8802)}, and shall be brought to pass{H1961}{(H8738)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,21,8,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,21,9,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; Say{H559}{(H8798)}, A sword{H2719}, a sword{H2719} is sharpened{H2300}{(H8717)}, and also furbished{H4803}{(H8803)}:"
Ezekiel,21,10,"It is sharpened{H2300}{(H8717)} to make a sore{H2874} slaughter{H2873}{(H8800)}; it is furbished{H4178}{(H8794)} that it may glitter{H1300}: should{H176} we then make mirth{H7797}{(H8799)}? it contemneth{H3988}{(H8802)} the rod{H7626} of my son{H1121}, as every tree{H6086}."
Ezekiel,21,11,"And he hath given{H5414}{(H8799)} it to be furbished{H4803}{(H8800)}, that it may be handled{H3709}{H8610}{(H8800)}: this sword{H2719} is sharpened{H2300}{(H8717)}, and it is furbished{H4178}{(H8794)}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} it into the hand{H3027} of the slayer{H2026}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry{H2199}{(H8798)} and howl{H3213}{(H8685)}, son{H1121} of man{H120}: for it shall be upon my people{H5971}, it shall be upon all the princes{H5387} of Israel{H3478}: terrors{H4048}{(H8803)} by reason of{H413} the sword{H2719} shall be upon my people{H5971}: smite{H5606}{(H8798)} therefore upon thy thigh{H3409}."
Ezekiel,21,13,"Because it is a trial{H974}{(H8795)}, and what if the sword contemn{H3988}{(H8802)} even the rod{H7626}? it shall be no more, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,21,14,"Thou therefore, son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)}, and smite{H5221} thine hands{H3709}{H3709} together{H5221}{(H8685)}, and let the sword{H2719} be doubled{H3717}{(H8735)} the third{H7992} time, the sword{H2719} of the slain{H2491}: it is the sword{H2719} of the great{H1419} men that are slain{H2491}, which entereth into their privy chambers{H2314}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,21,15,"I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} the point{H19} of the sword{H2719} against all their gates{H8179}, that their heart{H3820} may faint{H4127}{(H8800)}, and their ruins{H4383} be multiplied{H7235}{(H8687)}: ah{H253}! it is made{H6213}{(H8803)} bright{H1300}, it is wrapped up{H4593} for the slaughter{H2874}."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Go thee one way or other{H258}{(H8690)}, either on{H7760}{(H8685)} the right hand{H3231}{(H8685)}, or on the left{H8041}{(H8685)}, whithersoever{H575} thy face{H6440} is set{H3259}{(H8716)}."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I will also smite{H5221}{(H8686)} mine hands{H3709} together{H3709}, and I will cause my fury{H2534} to rest{H5117}{(H8689)}: I the LORD{H3068} have said{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,21,18,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me again, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,21,19,"Also, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, appoint{H7760}{(H8798)} thee two{H8147} ways{H1870}, that the sword{H2719} of the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} may come{H935}{(H8800)}: both twain{H8147} shall come forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of one{H259} land{H776}: and choose{H1254}{(H8761)} thou a place{H3027}, choose{H1254}{(H8761)} it at the head{H7218} of the way{H1870} to the city{H5892}."
Ezekiel,21,20,"Appoint{H7760}{(H8799)} a way{H1870}, that the sword{H2719} may come{H935}{(H8800)} to Rabbath{H7237} of the Ammonites{H1121}{H5983}, and to Judah{H3063} in Jerusalem{H3389} the defenced{H1219}{(H8803)}."
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} stood{H5975}{(H8804)} at the parting{H517} of the way{H1870}, at the head{H7218} of the two{H8147} ways{H1870}, to use{H7080}{(H8800)} divination{H7081}: he made his arrows{H2671} bright{H7043}{(H8773)}, he consulted{H7592}{(H8804)} with images{H8655}, he looked{H7200}{(H8804)} in the liver{H3516}."
Ezekiel,21,22,"At his right hand{H3225} was the divination{H7081} for Jerusalem{H3389}, to appoint{H7760}{(H8800)} captains{H3733}, to open{H6605}{(H8800)} the mouth{H6310} in the slaughter{H7524}, to lift up{H7311}{(H8687)} the voice{H6963} with shouting{H8643}, to appoint{H7760}{(H8800)} battering rams{H3733} against the gates{H8179}, to cast{H8210}{(H8800)} a mount{H5550}, and to build{H1129}{(H8800)} a fort{H1785}."
Ezekiel,21,23,"And it shall be unto them as a false{H7723} divination{H7080}{(H8800)} in their sight{H5869}, to them that have sworn{H7650}{(H8803)} oaths{H7621}: but he will call to remembrance{H2142}{(H8688)} the iniquity{H5771}, that they may be taken{H8610}{(H8736)}."
Ezekiel,21,24,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because ye have made your iniquity{H5771} to be remembered{H2142}{(H8687)}, in that your transgressions{H6588} are discovered{H1540}{(H8736)}, so that in all your doings{H5949} your sins{H2403} do appear{H7200}{(H8736)}; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance{H2142}{(H8736)}, ye shall be taken{H8610}{(H8735)} with the hand{H3709}."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And thou, profane{H2491} wicked{H7563} prince{H5387} of Israel{H3478}, whose day{H3117} is come{H935}{(H8804)}, when{H6256} iniquity{H5771} shall have an end{H7093},"
Ezekiel,21,26,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Remove{H5493}{(H8685)} the diadem{H4701}, and take off{H7311}{(H8685)} the crown{H5850}: this shall not be the same{H2063}: exalt{H1361}{(H8687)} him that is low{H8217}, and abase{H8213}{(H8687)} him that is high{H1364}."
Ezekiel,21,27,"I will overturn{H5754}, overturn{H5754}, overturn{H5754}, it: and it shall be{H7760}{(H8799)} no more, until he come{H935}{(H8800)} whose right{H4941} it is; and I will give{H5414}{(H8804)} it him."
Ezekiel,21,28,"And thou, son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} concerning the Ammonites{H1121}{H5983}, and concerning their reproach{H2781}; even say{H559}{(H8804)} thou, The sword{H2719}, the sword{H2719} is drawn{H6605}{(H8803)}: for the slaughter{H2874} it is furbished{H4803}{(H8803)}, to consume{H398}{(H8687)} because of the glittering{H1300}:"
Ezekiel,21,29,"Whiles they see{H2372}{(H8800)} vanity{H7723} unto thee, whiles they divine{H7080}{(H8800)} a lie{H3577} unto thee, to bring{H5414}{(H8800)} thee upon the necks{H6677} of them that are slain{H2491}, of the wicked{H7563}, whose day{H3117} is come{H935}{(H8804)}, when{H6256} their iniquity{H5771} shall have an end{H7093}."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Shall I cause it to return{H7725}{(H8685)} into his sheath{H8593}? I will judge{H8199}{(H8799)} thee in the place{H4725} where thou wast created{H1254}{(H8738)}, in the land{H776} of thy nativity{H4351}."
Ezekiel,21,31,"And I will pour out{H8210}{(H8804)} mine indignation{H2195} upon thee, I will blow{H6315}{(H8686)} against thee in the fire{H784} of my wrath{H5678}, and deliver{H5414}{(H8804)} thee into the hand{H3027} of brutish{H1197}{(H8802)} men{H582}, and skilful{H2796} to destroy{H4889}."
Ezekiel,21,32,Thou shalt be for fuel{H402} to the fire{H784}; thy blood{H1818} shall be in the midst{H8432} of the land{H776}; thou shalt be no more remembered{H2142}{(H8735)}: for I the LORD{H3068} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it.
Ezekiel,22,1,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,22,2,"Now, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, wilt thou judge{H8199}{(H8799)}, wilt thou judge{H8199}{(H8799)} the bloody{H1818} city{H5892}? yea, thou shalt shew{H3045}{(H8689)} her all her abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,22,3,"Then say{H559}{(H8804)} thou, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, The city{H5892} sheddeth{H8210}{(H8802)} blood{H1818} in the midst{H8432} of it, that her time{H6256} may come{H935}{(H8800)}, and maketh{H6213}{(H8804)} idols{H1544} against herself to defile{H2930}{(H8800)} herself."
Ezekiel,22,4,"Thou art become guilty{H816}{(H8804)} in thy blood{H1818} that thou hast shed{H8210}{(H8804)}; and hast defiled{H2930}{(H8804)} thyself in thine idols{H1544} which thou hast made{H6213}{(H8804)}; and thou hast caused thy days{H3117} to draw near{H7126}{(H8686)}, and art come{H935}{(H8799)} even unto thy years{H8141}: therefore have I made{H5414}{(H8804)} thee a reproach{H2781} unto the heathen{H1471}, and a mocking{H7048} to all countries{H776}."
Ezekiel,22,5,"Those that be near{H7138}, and those that be far{H7350} from thee, shall mock{H7046}{(H8691)} thee, which art infamous{H2931}{H8034} and much{H7227} vexed{H4103}."

Ezekiel,22,7,In thee have they set light{H7043}{(H8689)} by father{H1} and mother{H517}: in the midst{H8432} of thee have they dealt{H6213}{(H8804)} by oppression{H6233} with the stranger{H1616}: in thee have they vexed{H3238}{(H8689)} the fatherless{H3490} and the widow{H490}.

Ezekiel,22,10,In thee have they discovered{H1540}{(H8765)} their fathers{H1}' nakedness{H6172}: in thee have they humbled{H6031}{(H8765)} her that was set apart{H5079} for pollution{H2931}.
Ezekiel,22,11,"And one{H376} hath committed{H6213}{(H8804)} abomination{H8441} with his neighbour's{H7453} wife{H802}; and another{H376} hath lewdly{H2154} defiled{H2930}{(H8765)} his daughter in law{H3618}; and another{H376} in thee hath humbled{H6031}{(H8765)} his sister{H269}, his father's{H1} daughter{H1323}."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In thee have they taken{H3947}{(H8804)} gifts{H7810} to shed{H8210}{(H8800)} blood{H1818}; thou hast taken{H3947}{(H8804)} usury{H5392} and increase{H8636}, and thou hast greedily gained{H1214}{(H8762)} of thy neighbours{H7453} by extortion{H6233}, and hast forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."

Ezekiel,22,15,"And I will scatter{H6327}{(H8689)} thee among the heathen{H1471}, and disperse{H2219}{(H8765)} thee in the countries{H776}, and will consume{H8552}{(H8689)} thy filthiness{H2932} out of thee."

Ezekiel,22,18,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} is to me become dross{H5509}: all they are brass{H5178}, and tin{H913}, and iron{H1270}, and lead{H5777}, in the midst{H8432} of the furnace{H3564}; they are even the dross{H5509} of silver{H3701}."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because ye are all become dross{H5509}, behold, therefore I will gather{H6908}{(H8802)} you into the midst{H8432} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Ezekiel,22,20,"As they gather{H6910} silver{H3701}, and brass{H5178}, and iron{H1270}, and lead{H5777}, and tin{H913}, into the midst{H8432} of the furnace{H3564}, to blow{H5301}{(H8800)} the fire{H784} upon it, to melt{H5413}{(H8687)} it; so will I gather{H6908}{(H8799)} you in mine anger{H639} and in my fury{H2534}, and I will leave{H3240}{(H8689)} you there, and melt{H5413}{(H8689)} you."

Ezekiel,22,25,"There is a conspiracy{H7195} of her prophets{H5030} in the midst{H8432} thereof, like a roaring{H7580}{(H8802)} lion{H738} ravening{H2963}{(H8802)} the prey{H2964}; they have devoured{H398}{(H8804)} souls{H5315}; they have taken{H3947}{(H8799)} the treasure{H2633} and precious things{H3366}; they have made her many{H7235}{(H8689)} widows{H490} in the midst{H8432} thereof."
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests{H3548} have violated{H2554}{(H8804)} my law{H8451}, and have profaned{H2490}{(H8762)} mine holy things{H6944}: they have put no difference{H914}{(H8689)} between the holy{H6944} and profane{H2455}, neither have they shewed{H3045}{(H8689)} difference between the unclean{H2931} and the clean{H2889}, and have hid{H5956}{(H8689)} their eyes{H5869} from my sabbaths{H7676}, and I am profaned{H2490}{(H8735)} among{H8432} them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes{H8269} in the midst{H7130} thereof are like wolves{H2061} ravening{H2963}{(H8802)} the prey{H2964}, to shed{H8210}{(H8800)} blood{H1818}, and to destroy{H6}{(H8763)} souls{H5315}, to get{H1214}{(H8800)} dishonest gain{H1215}."

Ezekiel,22,29,"The people{H5971} of the land{H776} have used oppression{H6231}{(H8804)}{H6233}, and exercised{H1497}{(H8804)} robbery{H1498}, and have vexed{H3238}{(H8689)} the poor{H6041} and needy{H34}: yea, they have oppressed{H6231}{(H8804)} the stranger{H1616} wrongfully{H4941}."
Ezekiel,22,30,"And I sought{H1245}{(H8762)} for a man{H376} among them, that should make up{H1443}{(H8802)} the hedge{H1447}, and stand{H5975}{(H8802)} in the gap{H6556} before{H6440} me for the land{H776}, that I should not destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} it: but I found{H4672}{(H8804)} none."
Ezekiel,22,31,"Therefore have I poured out{H8210}{(H8799)} mine indignation{H2195} upon them; I have consumed{H3615}{(H8765)} them with the fire{H784} of my wrath{H5678}: their own way{H1870} have I recompensed{H5414}{(H8804)} upon their heads{H7218}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,23,1,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came again unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,23,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, there were two{H8147} women{H802}, the daughters{H1323} of one{H259} mother{H517}:"
Ezekiel,23,3,"And they committed whoredoms{H2181}{(H8799)} in Egypt{H4714}; they committed whoredoms{H2181}{(H8804)} in their youth{H5271}: there were their breasts{H7699} pressed{H4600}{(H8795)}, and there they bruised{H6213}{(H8765)} the teats{H1717} of their virginity{H1331}."
Ezekiel,23,4,"And the names{H8034} of them were Aholah{H170} the elder{H1419}, and Aholibah{H172} her sister{H269}: and they were mine, and they bare{H3205}{(H8799)} sons{H1121} and daughters{H1323}. Thus were their names{H8034}; Samaria{H8111} is Aholah{H170}, and Jerusalem{H3389} Aholibah{H172}."
Ezekiel,23,5,"And Aholah{H170} played the harlot{H2181}{(H8799)} when she was mine{H8478}; and she doted{H5689}{(H8799)} on her lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, on the Assyrians{H804} her neighbours{H7138},"
Ezekiel,23,6,"Which were clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} with blue{H8504}, captains{H6346} and rulers{H5461}, all of them desirable{H2531} young men{H970}, horsemen{H6571} riding{H7392}{(H8802)} upon horses{H5483}."
Ezekiel,23,7,"Thus she committed{H5414}{(H8799)} her whoredoms{H8457} with them, with all them that were the chosen{H4005} men{H1121} of Assyria{H804}, and with all on whom she doted{H5689}{(H8804)}: with all their idols{H1544} she defiled{H2930}{(H8738)} herself."
Ezekiel,23,8,"Neither left{H5800}{(H8804)} she her whoredoms{H8457} brought from Egypt{H4714}: for in her youth{H5271} they lay{H7901}{(H8804)} with her, and they bruised{H6213}{(H8765)} the breasts{H1717} of her virginity{H1331}, and poured{H8210}{(H8799)} their whoredom{H8457} upon her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"Wherefore I have delivered{H5414}{(H8804)} her into the hand{H3027} of her lovers{H157}{(H8764)}, into the hand{H3027} of the Assyrians{H1121}{H804}, upon whom she doted{H5689}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,23,10,"These discovered{H1540}{(H8765)} her nakedness{H6172}: they took{H3947}{(H8804)} her sons{H1121} and her daughters{H1323}, and slew{H2026}{(H8804)} her with the sword{H2719}: and she became famous{H8034} among women{H802}; for they had executed{H6213}{(H8804)} judgment{H8196} upon her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"And when her sister{H269} Aholibah{H172} saw{H7200}{(H8799)} this, she was more corrupt{H7843}{(H8686)} in her inordinate love{H5691} than she, and in her whoredoms{H8457} more than her sister{H269} in her whoredoms{H2183}."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She doted{H5689}{(H8804)} upon the Assyrians{H1121}{H804} her neighbours{H7138}, captains{H6346} and rulers{H5461} clothed{H3847}{(H8803)} most gorgeously{H4358}, horsemen{H6571} riding{H7392}{(H8802)} upon horses{H5483}, all of them desirable{H2531} young men{H970}."
Ezekiel,23,13,"Then I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} that she was defiled{H2930}{(H8738)}, that they took both{H8147} one{H259} way{H1870},"
Ezekiel,23,14,"And that she increased{H3254}{(H8686)} her whoredoms{H8457}: for when she saw{H7200}{(H8799)} men{H582} pourtrayed{H2707}{(H8794)} upon the wall{H7023}, the images{H6754} of the Chaldeans{H3778} pourtrayed{H2710}{(H8803)} with vermilion{H8350},"
Ezekiel,23,15,"Girded{H2289} with girdles{H232} upon their loins{H4975}, exceeding{H5628}{(H8803)} in dyed attire{H2871} upon their heads{H7218}, all of them princes{H7991} to look to{H4758}, after the manner{H1823} of the Babylonians{H1121}{H894} of Chaldea{H3778}, the land{H776} of their nativity{H4138}:"
Ezekiel,23,16,"And as soon as she saw{H4758} them with her eyes{H5869}, she doted{H5689}{(H8799)} upon them, and sent{H7971}{(H8799)} messengers{H4397} unto them into Chaldea{H3778}."
Ezekiel,23,17,"And the Babylonians{H1121}{H894} came{H935}{(H8799)} to her into the bed{H4904} of love{H1730}, and they defiled{H2930}{(H8762)} her with their whoredom{H8457}, and she was polluted{H2930}{(H8799)} with them, and her mind{H5315} was alienated{H3363}{(H8799)} from them."
Ezekiel,23,18,"So she discovered{H1540}{(H8762)} her whoredoms{H8457}, and discovered{H1540}{(H8762)} her nakedness{H6172}: then my mind{H5315} was alienated{H3363}{(H8799)} from her, like as my mind{H5315} was alienated{H5361}{(H8804)} from her sister{H269}."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she multiplied{H7235}{(H8686)} her whoredoms{H8457}, in calling to remembrance{H2142}{(H8800)} the days{H3117} of her youth{H5271}, wherein she had played the harlot{H2181}{(H8804)} in the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}."
Ezekiel,23,20,"For she doted{H5689}{(H8799)} upon their paramours{H6370}, whose flesh{H1320} is as the flesh{H1320} of asses{H2543}, and whose issue{H2231} is like the issue{H2231} of horses{H5483}."
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thus thou calledst to remembrance{H6485}{(H8799)} the lewdness{H2154} of thy youth{H5271}, in bruising{H6213}{(H8800)} thy teats{H1717} by the Egyptians{H4714} for the paps{H7699} of thy youth{H5271}."
Ezekiel,23,22,"Therefore, O Aholibah{H172}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I will raise up{H5782}{(H8688)} thy lovers{H157}{(H8764)} against thee, from whom thy mind{H5315} is alienated{H5361}{(H8804)}, and I will bring{H935}{(H8689)} them against thee on every side{H5439};"

Ezekiel,23,26,"They shall also strip{H6584}{(H8689)} thee out of thy clothes{H899}, and take away{H3947}{(H8804)} thy fair{H8597} jewels{H3627}."
Ezekiel,23,27,"Thus will I make thy lewdness{H2154} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} from thee, and thy whoredom{H2184} brought from the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714}: so that thou shalt not lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} thine eyes{H5869} unto them, nor remember{H2142}{(H8799)} Egypt{H4714} any more."
Ezekiel,23,28,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I will deliver{H5414}{(H8802)} thee into the hand{H3027} of them whom thou hatest{H8130}{(H8804)}, into the hand{H3027} of them from whom thy mind{H5315} is alienated{H5361}{(H8804)}:"

Ezekiel,23,30,"I will do{H6213}{(H8800)} these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring{H2181}{(H8800)} after{H310} the heathen{H1471}, and because thou art polluted{H2930}{(H8738)} with their idols{H1544}."
Ezekiel,23,31,Thou hast walked{H1980}{(H8804)} in the way{H1870} of thy sister{H269}; therefore will I give{H5414}{(H8804)} her cup{H3563} into thine hand{H3027}.
Ezekiel,23,32,Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Thou shalt drink{H8354}{(H8799)} of thy sister's{H269} cup{H3563} deep{H6013} and large{H7342}: thou shalt be laughed to scorn{H6712} and had in derision{H3933}; it containeth{H3557}{(H8687)} much{H4767}.
Ezekiel,23,33,"Thou shalt be filled{H4390}{(H8735)} with drunkenness{H7943} and sorrow{H3015}, with the cup{H3563} of astonishment{H8047} and desolation{H8077}, with the cup{H3563} of thy sister{H269} Samaria{H8111}."
Ezekiel,23,34,"Thou shalt even drink{H8354}{(H8804)} it and suck it out{H4680}{(H8804)}, and thou shalt break{H1633}{(H8762)} the sherds{H2789} thereof, and pluck off{H5423}{(H8762)} thine own breasts{H7699}: for I have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because thou hast forgotten{H7911}{(H8804)} me, and cast{H7993}{(H8686)} me behind{H310} thy back{H1458}, therefore bear{H5375}{(H8798)} thou also thy lewdness{H2154} and thy whoredoms{H8457}."
Ezekiel,23,36,"The LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} moreover unto me; Son{H1121} of man{H120}, wilt thou judge{H8199}{(H8799)} Aholah{H170} and Aholibah{H172}? yea, declare{H5046}{(H8685)} unto them their abominations{H8441};"
Ezekiel,23,37,"That they have committed adultery{H5003}{(H8765)}, and blood{H1818} is in their hands{H3027}, and with their idols{H1544} have they committed adultery{H5003}{(H8765)}, and have also caused their sons{H1121}, whom they bare{H3205}{(H8804)} unto me, to pass for them through{H5674}{(H8689)} the fire, to devour{H402} them."
Ezekiel,23,38,"Moreover this they have done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto me: they have defiled{H2930}{(H8765)} my sanctuary{H4720} in the same day{H3117}, and have profaned{H2490}{(H8765)} my sabbaths{H7676}."
Ezekiel,23,39,"For when they had slain{H7819}{(H8800)} their children{H1121} to their idols{H1544}, then they came{H935}{(H8799)} the same day{H3117} into my sanctuary{H4720} to profane{H2490}{(H8763)} it; and, lo, thus have they done{H6213}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of mine house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,23,40,"And furthermore{H637}, that ye have sent{H7971}{(H8799)} for men{H582} to come{H935}{(H8802)} from far{H4801}, unto whom a messenger{H4397} was sent{H7971}{(H8803)}; and, lo, they came{H935}{(H8804)}: for whom thou didst wash{H7364}{(H8804)} thyself, paintedst{H3583}{(H8804)} thy eyes{H5869}, and deckedst{H5710}{(H8804)} thyself with ornaments{H5716},"
Ezekiel,23,41,"And satest{H3427}{(H8804)} upon a stately{H3520} bed{H4296}, and a table{H7979} prepared{H6186}{(H8803)} before{H6440} it, whereupon thou hast set{H7760}{(H8804)} mine incense{H7004} and mine oil{H8081}."
Ezekiel,23,42,"And a voice{H6963} of a multitude{H1995} being at ease{H7961} was with her: and with the men{H582} of the common sort{H7230}{H120} were brought{H935}{(H8716)} Sabeans{H5436}{(H8675)}{H5433}{(H8802)} from the wilderness{H4057}, which put{H5414}{(H8799)} bracelets{H6781} upon their hands{H3027}, and beautiful{H8597} crowns{H5850} upon their heads{H7218}."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} I unto her that was old{H1087} in adulteries{H5004}, Will they now commit{H2181}{(H8799)} whoredoms{H8457} with her, and she with them?"
Ezekiel,23,44,"Yet they went in{H935}{(H8799)} unto her, as they go in{H935}{(H8800)} unto a woman{H802} that playeth the harlot{H2181}{(H8802)}: so went they in{H935}{(H8804)} unto Aholah{H170} and unto Aholibah{H172}, the lewd{H2154} women{H802}."
Ezekiel,23,45,"And the righteous{H6662} men{H582}, they shall judge{H8199}{(H8799)} them after the manner{H4941} of adulteresses{H5003}{(H8802)}, and after the manner{H4941} of women that shed{H8210}{(H8802)} blood{H1818}; because they are adulteresses{H5003}{(H8802)}, and blood{H1818} is in their hands{H3027}."
Ezekiel,23,46,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will bring up{H5927}{(H8687)} a company{H6951} upon them, and will give{H5414}{(H8800)} them to be removed{H2189} and spoiled{H957}."
Ezekiel,23,47,"And the company{H6951} shall stone{H7275}{(H8804)} them with stones{H68}, and dispatch{H1254}{(H8763)} them with their swords{H2719}; they shall slay{H2026}{(H8799)} their sons{H1121} and their daughters{H1323}, and burn up{H8313}{(H8799)} their houses{H1004} with fire{H784}."
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus will I cause lewdness{H2154} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776}, that all women{H802} may be taught{H3256}{(H8739)} not to do{H6213}{(H8799)} after your lewdness{H2154}."
Ezekiel,23,49,"And they shall recompense{H5414}{(H8804)} your lewdness{H2154} upon you, and ye shall bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the sins{H2399} of your idols{H1544}: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,24,1,"Again in the ninth{H8671} year{H8141}, in the tenth{H6224} month{H2320}, in the tenth{H6218} day of the month{H2320}, the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,24,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, write{H3789}{(H8798)} thee the name{H8034} of the day{H3117}, even of this same{H6106} day{H3117}: the king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} set{H5564}{(H8804)} himself against Jerusalem{H3389} this same{H6106} day{H3117}."
Ezekiel,24,3,"And utter{H4911}{(H8798)} a parable{H4912} unto the rebellious{H4805} house{H1004}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Set on{H8239}{(H8798)} a pot{H5518}, set it on{H8239}{(H8798)}, and also pour{H3332}{(H8798)} water{H4325} into it:"
Ezekiel,24,4,"Gather{H622}{(H8798)} the pieces{H5409} thereof into it, even every good{H2896} piece{H5409}, the thigh{H3409}, and the shoulder{H3802}; fill{H4390}{(H8761)} it with the choice{H4005} bones{H6106}."
Ezekiel,24,5,"Take{H3947}{(H8800)} the choice{H4005} of the flock{H6629}, and burn{H1754} also the bones{H6106} under it, and make it boil{H7570}{(H8761)} well{H7571}, and let them seethe{H1310}{(H8804)} the bones{H6106} of it therein{H8432}."
Ezekiel,24,6,"Wherefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Woe{H188} to the bloody{H1818} city{H5892}, to the pot{H5518} whose scum{H2457} is therein, and whose scum{H2457} is not gone out{H3318}{(H8804)} of it! bring it out{H3318}{(H8685)} piece{H5409} by piece{H5409}; let no lot{H1486} fall{H5307}{(H8804)} upon it."
Ezekiel,24,7,"For her blood{H1818} is in the midst{H8432} of her; she set{H7760}{(H8804)} it upon the top{H6706} of a rock{H5553}; she poured{H8210}{(H8804)} it not upon the ground{H776}, to cover{H3680}{(H8763)} it with dust{H6083};"
Ezekiel,24,8,"That it might cause fury{H2534} to come up{H5927}{(H8687)} to take{H5358}{(H8800)} vengeance{H5359}; I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} her blood{H1818} upon the top{H6706} of a rock{H5553}, that it should not be covered{H3680}{(H8736)}."
Ezekiel,24,9,Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Woe{H188} to the bloody{H1818} city{H5892}! I will even make the pile{H4071} for fire great{H1431}{(H8686)}.
Ezekiel,24,10,"Heap{H7235}{(H8685)} on wood{H6086}, kindle{H1814}{(H8687)} the fire{H784}, consume{H8552}{(H8687)} the flesh{H1320}, and spice{H7543}{(H8687)} it well{H4841}, and let the bones{H6106} be burned{H2787}{(H8735)}."
Ezekiel,24,11,"Then set{H5975}{(H8687)} it empty{H7386} upon the coals{H1513} thereof, that the brass{H5178} of it may be hot{H3179}{(H8799)}, and may burn{H2787}{(H8804)}, and that the filthiness{H2932} of it may be molten{H5413}{(H8738)} in it{H8432}, that the scum{H2457} of it may be consumed{H8552}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,24,12,"She hath wearied{H3811}{(H8689)} herself with lies{H8383}, and her great{H7227} scum{H2457} went not forth{H3318}{(H8799)} out of her: her scum{H2457} shall be in the fire{H784}."
Ezekiel,24,13,"In thy filthiness{H2932} is lewdness{H2154}: because I have purged{H2891}{(H8765)} thee, and thou wast not purged{H2891}{(H8804)}, thou shalt not be purged{H2891}{(H8799)} from thy filthiness{H2932} any more, till I have caused my fury{H2534} to rest{H5117}{(H8687)} upon thee."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I the LORD{H3068} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it: it shall come to pass{H935}{(H8802)}, and I will do{H6213}{(H8804)} it; I will not go back{H6544}{(H8799)}, neither will I spare{H2347}{(H8799)}, neither will I repent{H5162}{(H8735)}; according to thy ways{H1870}, and according to thy doings{H5949}, shall they judge{H8199}{(H8804)} thee, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,24,15,"Also the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,24,16,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, behold, I take away{H3947}{(H8802)} from thee the desire{H4261} of thine eyes{H5869} with a stroke{H4046}: yet neither shalt thou mourn{H5594}{(H8799)} nor weep{H1058}{(H8799)}, neither shall thy tears{H1832} run down{H935}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Forbear{H1826}{(H8798)} to cry{H602}{(H8736)}, make{H6213}{(H8799)} no mourning{H60} for the dead{H4191}{(H8801)}, bind{H2280}{(H8798)} the tire of thine head{H6287} upon thee, and put on{H7760}{(H8799)} thy shoes{H5275} upon thy feet{H7272}, and cover{H5844}{(H8799)} not thy lips{H8222}, and eat{H398}{(H8799)} not the bread{H3899} of men{H582}."
Ezekiel,24,18,So I spake{H1696}{(H8762)} unto the people{H5971} in the morning{H1242}: and at even{H6153} my wife{H802} died{H4191}{(H8799)}; and I did{H6213}{(H8799)} in the morning{H1242} as I was commanded{H6680}{(H8795)}.
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people{H5971} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Wilt thou not tell{H5046}{(H8686)} us what these things are to us, that thou doest{H6213}{(H8802)} so?"
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I answered{H559}{(H8799)} them, The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,24,21,"Speak{H559}{(H8798)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I will profane{H2490}{(H8764)} my sanctuary{H4720}, the excellency{H1347} of your strength{H5797}, the desire{H4261} of your eyes{H5869}, and that which your soul{H5315} pitieth{H4263}; and your sons{H1121} and your daughters{H1323} whom ye have left{H5800}{(H8804)} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}."
Ezekiel,24,22,"And ye shall do{H6213}{(H8804)} as I have done{H6213}{(H8804)}: ye shall not cover{H5844}{(H8799)} your lips{H8222}, nor eat{H398}{(H8799)} the bread{H3899} of men{H582}."
Ezekiel,24,23,"And your tires{H6287} shall be upon your heads{H7218}, and your shoes{H5275} upon your feet{H7272}: ye shall not mourn{H5594}{(H8799)} nor weep{H1058}{(H8799)}; but ye shall pine away{H4743}{(H8738)} for your iniquities{H5771}, and mourn{H5098}{(H8804)} one{H376} toward another{H251}."
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus Ezekiel{H3168} is unto you a sign{H4159}: according to all that he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} shall ye do{H6213}{(H8799)}: and when this cometh{H935}{(H8800)}, ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."

Ezekiel,28,3,"Behold, thou art wiser{H2450} than Daniel{H1840}; there is no secret{H5640}{(H8803)} that they can hide{H6004}{(H8804)} from thee:"
Ezekiel,28,4,"With thy wisdom{H2451} and with thine understanding{H8394} thou hast gotten{H6213}{(H8804)} thee riches{H2428}, and hast gotten{H6213}{(H8799)} gold{H2091} and silver{H3701} into thy treasures{H214}:"
Ezekiel,28,5,"By thy great{H7230} wisdom{H2451} and by thy traffick{H7404} hast thou increased{H7235}{(H8689)} thy riches{H2428}, and thine heart{H3824} is lifted up{H1361}{(H8799)} because of thy riches{H2428}:"
Ezekiel,28,6,Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because thou hast set{H5414}{(H8800)} thine heart{H3820} as the heart{H3824} of God{H430};
Ezekiel,28,7,"Behold, therefore I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} strangers{H2114}{(H8801)} upon thee, the terrible{H6184} of the nations{H1471}: and they shall draw{H7324}{(H8689)} their swords{H2719} against the beauty{H3308} of thy wisdom{H2451}, and they shall defile{H2490}{(H8765)} thy brightness{H3314}."
Ezekiel,28,8,"They shall bring thee down{H3381}{(H8686)} to the pit{H7845}, and thou shalt die{H4191}{(H8804)} the deaths{H4463} of them that are slain{H2491} in the midst{H3820} of the seas{H3220}."
Ezekiel,28,9,"Wilt thou yet{H559}{(H8800)} say{H559}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him that slayeth{H2026}{(H8802)} thee, I am God{H430}? but thou shalt be a man{H120}, and no God{H410}, in the hand{H3027} of him that slayeth{H2490}{(H8764)} thee."
Ezekiel,28,10,"Thou shalt die{H4191}{(H8799)} the deaths{H4194} of the uncircumcised{H6189} by the hand{H3027} of strangers{H2114}{(H8801)}: for I have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,28,11,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,28,12,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, take up{H5375}{(H8798)} a lamentation{H7015} upon the king{H4428} of Tyrus{H6865}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Thou sealest up{H2856}{(H8802)} the sum{H8508}, full{H4392} of wisdom{H2451}, and perfect{H3632} in beauty{H3308}."
Ezekiel,28,13,"Thou hast been in Eden{H5731} the garden{H1588} of God{H430}; every precious{H3368} stone{H68} was thy covering{H4540}, the sardius{H124}, topaz{H6357}, and the diamond{H3095}, the beryl{H8658}, the onyx{H7718}, and the jasper{H3471}, the sapphire{H5601}, the emerald{H5306}, and the carbuncle{H1304}, and gold{H2091}: the workmanship{H4399} of thy tabrets{H8596} and of thy pipes{H5345} was prepared{H3559}{(H8797)} in thee in the day{H3117} that thou wast created{H1254}{(H8736)}."
Ezekiel,28,14,Thou art the anointed{H4473} cherub{H3742} that covereth{H5526}{(H8802)}; and I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} thee so: thou wast upon the holy{H6944} mountain{H2022} of God{H430}; thou hast walked up and down{H1980}{(H8694)} in the midst{H8432} of the stones{H68} of fire{H784}.
Ezekiel,28,15,"Thou wast perfect{H8549} in thy ways{H1870} from the day{H3117} that thou wast created{H1254}{(H8736)}, till iniquity{H5766} was found{H4672}{(H8738)} in thee."
Ezekiel,28,16,"By the multitude{H7230} of thy merchandise{H7404} they have filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the midst{H8432} of thee with violence{H2555}, and thou hast sinned{H2398}{(H8799)}: therefore I will cast thee as profane{H2490}{(H8762)} out of the mountain{H2022} of God{H430}: and I will destroy{H6}{(H8762)} thee, O covering{H5526}{(H8802)} cherub{H3742}, from the midst{H8432} of the stones{H68} of fire{H784}."
Ezekiel,28,17,"Thine heart{H3820} was lifted up{H1361}{(H8804)} because of thy beauty{H3308}, thou hast corrupted{H7843}{(H8765)} thy wisdom{H2451} by reason of{H5921} thy brightness{H3314}: I will cast{H7993}{(H8689)} thee to the ground{H776}, I will lay{H5414}{(H8804)} thee before{H6440} kings{H4428}, that they may behold{H7200}{(H8800)} thee."
Ezekiel,28,18,"Thou hast defiled{H2490}{(H8765)} thy sanctuaries{H4720} by the multitude{H7230} of thine iniquities{H5771}, by the iniquity{H5766} of thy traffick{H7404}; therefore will I bring forth{H3318}{(H8686)} a fire{H784} from the midst{H8432} of thee, it shall devour{H398}{(H8804)} thee, and I will bring{H5414}{(H8799)} thee to ashes{H665} upon the earth{H776} in the sight{H5869} of all them that behold{H7200}{(H8802)} thee."
Ezekiel,28,19,"All they that know{H3045}{(H8802)} thee among the people{H5971} shall be astonished{H8074}{(H8804)} at thee: thou shalt be a terror{H1091}, and never{H369} shalt thou be any more{H5704}{H5769}."
Ezekiel,28,20,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,28,21,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} against Zidon{H6721}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against it,"
Ezekiel,28,22,"And say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon{H6721}; and I will be glorified{H3513}{(H8738)} in the midst{H8432} of thee: and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I shall have executed{H6213}{(H8800)} judgments{H8201} in her, and shall be sanctified{H6942}{(H8738)} in her."
Ezekiel,28,23,"For I will send{H7971}{(H8765)} into her pestilence{H1698}, and blood{H1818} into her streets{H2351}; and the wounded{H2491} shall be judged{H5307}{(H8768)} in the midst{H8432} of her by the sword{H2719} upon her on every side{H5439}; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,28,24,"And there shall be no more a pricking{H3992}{(H8688)} brier{H5544} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, nor any grieving{H3510}{(H8688)} thorn{H6975} of all that are round about{H5439} them, that despised{H7590}{(H8801)} them; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,28,25,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; When I shall have gathered{H6908}{(H8763)} the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} from the people{H5971} among whom they are scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}, and shall be sanctified{H6942}{(H8738)} in them in the sight{H5869} of the heathen{H1471}, then shall they dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} in their land{H127} that I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} to my servant{H5650} Jacob{H3290}."
Ezekiel,28,26,"And they shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} safely{H983} therein, and shall build{H1129}{(H8804)} houses{H1004}, and plant{H5193}{(H8804)} vineyards{H3754}; yea, they shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} with confidence{H983}, when I have executed{H6213}{(H8800)} judgments{H8201} upon all those that despise{H7590}{(H8801)} them round about{H5439} them; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}."
Ezekiel,29,1,"In the tenth{H6224} year{H8141}, in the tenth{H6224} month, in the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} day of the month{H2320}, the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,29,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} against Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against him, and against all Egypt{H4714}:"
Ezekiel,29,3,"Speak{H1696}{(H8761)}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, the great{H1419} dragon{H8577} that lieth{H7257}{(H8802)} in the midst{H8432} of his rivers{H2975}, which hath said{H559}{(H8804)}, My river{H2975} is mine own, and I have made{H6213}{(H8804)} it for myself."
Ezekiel,29,4,"But I will put{H5414}{(H8804)} hooks{H2397}{(H8676)}{H2397} in thy jaws{H3895}, and I will cause the fish{H1710} of thy rivers{H2975} to stick{H1692}{(H8689)} unto thy scales{H7193}, and I will bring thee up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of the midst{H8432} of thy rivers{H2975}, and all the fish{H1710} of thy rivers{H2975} shall stick{H1692}{(H8799)} unto thy scales{H7193}."
Ezekiel,29,5,"And I will leave{H5203}{(H8804)} thee thrown into the wilderness{H4057}, thee and all the fish{H1710} of thy rivers{H2975}: thou shalt fall{H5307}{(H8799)} upon the open{H6440} fields{H7704}; thou shalt not be brought together{H622}{(H8735)}, nor gathered{H6908}{(H8735)}: I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} thee for meat{H402} to the beasts{H2416} of the field{H776} and to the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064}."
Ezekiel,29,6,"And all the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Egypt{H4714} shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, because they have been a staff{H4938} of reed{H7070} to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,29,7,"When they took hold{H8610}{(H8800)} of thee by thy hand{H3709}, thou didst break{H7533}{(H8735)}, and rend{H1234}{(H8804)} all their shoulder{H3802}: and when they leaned{H8172}{(H8736)} upon thee, thou brakest{H7665}{(H8735)}, and madest all their loins{H4975} to be at a stand{H5976}{(H8689)}."
Ezekiel,29,8,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I will bring{H935}{(H8688)} a sword{H2719} upon thee, and cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} man{H120} and beast{H929} out of thee."
Ezekiel,29,9,"And the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} shall be desolate{H8077} and waste{H2723}; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}: because he hath said{H559}{(H8804)}, The river{H2975} is mine, and I have made{H6213}{(H8804)} it."
Ezekiel,29,10,"Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers{H2975}, and I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} utterly{H2721} waste{H2723} and desolate{H8077}, from the tower{H4024} of Syene{H5482} even unto the border{H1366} of Ethiopia{H3568}."
Ezekiel,29,11,"No foot{H7272} of man{H120} shall pass through{H5674}{(H8799)} it, nor foot{H7272} of beast{H929} shall pass through{H5674}{(H8799)} it, neither shall it be inhabited{H3427}{(H8799)} forty{H705} years{H8141}."
Ezekiel,29,12,"And I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} desolate{H8077} in the midst{H8432} of the countries{H776} that are desolate{H8074}{(H8737)}, and her cities{H5892} among{H8432} the cities{H5892} that are laid waste{H2717}{(H8716)} shall be desolate{H8077} forty{H705} years{H8141}: and I will scatter{H6327}{(H8689)} the Egyptians{H4714} among the nations{H1471}, and will disperse{H2219}{(H8765)} them through the countries{H776}."
Ezekiel,29,13,Yet thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; At the end{H7093} of forty{H705} years{H8141} will I gather{H6908}{(H8762)} the Egyptians{H4714} from the people{H5971} whither they were scattered{H6327}{(H8738)}:
Ezekiel,29,14,"And I will bring again{H7725}{(H8804)} the captivity{H7622} of Egypt{H4714}, and will cause them to return{H7725}{(H8689)} into the land{H776} of Pathros{H6624}, into the land{H776} of their habitation{H4351}; and they shall be there a base{H8217} kingdom{H4467}."
Ezekiel,29,15,"It shall be the basest{H8217} of the kingdoms{H4467}; neither shall it exalt{H5375}{(H8691)} itself any more above the nations{H1471}: for I will diminish{H4591}{(H8689)} them, that they shall no more rule{H7287}{(H8800)} over the nations{H1471}."
Ezekiel,29,16,"And it shall be no more the confidence{H4009} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, which bringeth{H2142} their iniquity{H5771} to remembrance{H2142}{(H8688)}, when they shall look{H6437}{(H8800)} after{H310} them: but they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,29,17,"And it came to pass in the seven{H7651} and twentieth{H6242} year{H8141}, in the first{H7223} month, in the first{H259} day of the month{H2320}, the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,29,18,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} caused{H5647} his army{H2428} to serve{H5647}{(H8689)} a great{H1419} service{H5656} against Tyrus{H6865}: every head{H7218} was made bald{H7139}{(H8716)}, and every shoulder{H3802} was peeled{H4803}{(H8803)}: yet had he no wages{H7939}, nor his army{H2428}, for Tyrus{H6865}, for the service{H5656} that he had served{H5647}{(H8804)} against it:"
Ezekiel,29,19,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I will give{H5414}{(H8802)} the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} unto Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}; and he shall take{H5375}{(H8804)} her multitude{H1995}, and take{H7997}{(H8804)} her spoil{H7998}, and take{H962}{(H8804)} her prey{H957}; and it shall be the wages{H7939} for his army{H2428}."
Ezekiel,29,20,"I have given{H5414}{(H8804)} him the land{H776} of Egypt{H4714} for his labour{H6468} wherewith he served{H5647}{(H8804)} against it, because they wrought{H6213}{(H8804)} for me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,29,21,"In that day{H3117} will I cause{H6779} the horn{H7161} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} to bud forth{H6779}{(H8686)}, and I will give{H5414}{(H8799)} thee the opening{H6610} of the mouth{H6310} in the midst{H8432} of them; and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,30,1,"The word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came again unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,30,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Howl{H3213}{(H8685)} ye, Woe worth{H1929} the day{H3117}!"
Ezekiel,30,3,"For the day{H3117} is near{H7138}, even the day{H3117} of the LORD{H3068} is near{H7138}, a cloudy{H6051} day{H3117}; it shall be the time{H6256} of the heathen{H1471}."
Ezekiel,30,4,"And the sword{H2719} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} upon Egypt{H4714}, and great pain{H2479} shall be in Ethiopia{H3568}, when the slain{H2491} shall fall{H5307}{(H8800)} in Egypt{H4714}, and they shall take away{H3947}{(H8804)} her multitude{H1995}, and her foundations{H3247} shall be broken down{H2040}{(H8738)}."
Ezekiel,30,5,"Ethiopia{H3568}, and Libya{H6316}, and Lydia{H3865}, and all the mingled{H6153} people, and Chub{H3552}, and the men{H1121} of the land{H776} that is in league{H1285}, shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} with them by the sword{H2719}."
Ezekiel,30,6,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the LORD{H3068}; They also that uphold{H5564}{(H8802)} Egypt{H4714} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)}; and the pride{H1347} of her power{H5797} shall come down{H3381}{(H8804)}: from the tower{H4024} of Syene{H5482} shall they fall{H5307}{(H8799)} in it by the sword{H2719}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,30,7,"And they shall be desolate{H8074}{(H8738)} in the midst{H8432} of the countries{H776} that are desolate{H8074}{(H8737)}, and her cities{H5892} shall be in the midst{H8432} of the cities{H5892} that are wasted{H2717}{(H8737)}."
Ezekiel,30,8,"And they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I have set{H5414}{(H8800)} a fire{H784} in Egypt{H4714}, and when all her helpers{H5826}{(H8802)} shall be destroyed{H7665}{(H8738)}."
Ezekiel,30,9,"In that day{H3117} shall messengers{H4397} go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} from me{H6440} in ships{H6716} to make the careless{H983} Ethiopians{H3568} afraid{H2729}{(H8687)}, and great pain{H2479} shall come upon them, as in the day{H3117} of Egypt{H4714}: for, lo, it cometh{H935}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,30,10,Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will also make the multitude{H1995} of Egypt{H4714} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} by the hand{H3027} of Nebuchadrezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894}.

Ezekiel,31,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, speak{H559}{(H8798)} unto Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and to his multitude{H1995}; Whom art thou like{H1819}{(H8804)} in thy greatness{H1433}?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"Behold, the Assyrian{H804} was a cedar{H730} in Lebanon{H3844} with fair{H3303} branches{H6057}, and with a shadowing{H6751}{(H8688)} shroud{H2793}, and of an high{H1362} stature{H6967}; and his top{H6788} was among the thick boughs{H5688}."
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters{H4325} made him great{H1431}{(H8765)}, the deep{H8415} set him up on high{H7311}{(H8790)} with her rivers{H5104} running{H1980}{(H8802)} round about{H5439} his plants{H4302}, and sent out{H7971}{(H8765)} her little rivers{H8585} unto all the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704}."
Ezekiel,31,5,"Therefore his height{H6967} was exalted{H1361}{(H8804)} above all the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704}, and his boughs{H5634} were multiplied{H7235}{(H8799)}, and his branches{H6288} became long{H748}{(H8799)} because of the multitude{H7227} of waters{H4325}, when he shot forth{H7971}{(H8763)}."
Ezekiel,31,6,"All the fowls{H5775} of heaven{H8064} made their nests{H7077}{(H8765)} in his boughs{H5589}, and under his branches{H6288} did all the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704} bring forth their young{H3205}{(H8804)}, and under his shadow{H6738} dwelt{H3427}{(H8799)} all great{H7227} nations{H1471}."
Ezekiel,31,7,"Thus was he fair{H3302}{(H8799)} in his greatness{H1433}, in the length{H753} of his branches{H1808}: for his root{H8328} was by great{H7227} waters{H4325}."
Ezekiel,31,8,"The cedars{H730} in the garden{H1588} of God{H430} could not hide{H6004}{(H8804)} him: the fir trees{H1265} were not like{H1819}{(H8804)} his boughs{H5589}, and the chesnut trees{H6196} were not like his branches{H6288}; nor any tree{H6086} in the garden{H1588} of God{H430} was like{H1819}{(H8804)} unto him in his beauty{H3308}."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I have made{H6213}{(H8804)} him fair{H3303} by the multitude{H7230} of his branches{H1808}: so that all the trees{H6086} of Eden{H5731}, that were in the garden{H1588} of God{H430}, envied{H7065}{(H8762)} him."
Ezekiel,31,10,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because thou hast lifted up{H1361}{(H8804)} thyself in height{H6967}, and he hath shot up{H5414}{(H8799)} his top{H6788} among the thick boughs{H5688}, and his heart{H3824} is lifted up{H7311}{(H8804)} in his height{H1363};"
Ezekiel,31,11,I have therefore delivered{H5414}{(H8799)} him into the hand{H3027} of the mighty one{H410} of the heathen{H1471}; he shall surely{H6213}{(H8800)} deal{H6213}{(H8799)} with him: I have driven him out{H1644}{(H8765)} for his wickedness{H7562}.
Ezekiel,31,12,"And strangers{H2114}{(H8801)}, the terrible{H6184} of the nations{H1471}, have cut him off{H3772}{(H8799)}, and have left{H5203}{(H8799)} him: upon the mountains{H2022} and in all the valleys{H1516} his branches{H1808} are fallen{H5307}{(H8804)}, and his boughs{H6288} are broken{H7665}{(H8735)} by all the rivers{H650} of the land{H776}; and all the people{H5971} of the earth{H776} are gone down{H3381}{(H8799)} from his shadow{H6738}, and have left{H5203}{(H8799)} him."
Ezekiel,31,13,"Upon his ruin{H4658} shall all the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064} remain{H7931}{(H8799)}, and all the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704} shall be upon his branches{H6288}:"
Ezekiel,31,14,"To the end that none of all the trees{H6086} by the waters{H4325} exalt{H1361}{(H8799)} themselves for their height{H6967}, neither shoot up{H5414}{(H8799)} their top{H6788} among the thick boughs{H5688}, neither their trees{H352} stand up{H5975}{(H8799)} in their height{H1363}, all that drink{H8354}{(H8802)} water{H4325}: for they are all delivered{H5414}{(H8738)} unto death{H4194}, to the nether parts{H8482} of the earth{H776}, in the midst{H8432} of the children{H1121} of men{H120}, with them that go down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the pit{H953}."
Ezekiel,31,15,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; In the day{H3117} when he went down{H3381}{(H8800)} to the grave{H7585} I caused a mourning{H56}{(H8689)}: I covered{H3680}{(H8765)} the deep{H8415} for him, and I restrained{H4513}{(H8799)} the floods{H5104} thereof, and the great{H7227} waters{H4325} were stayed{H3607}{(H8735)}: and I caused Lebanon{H3844} to mourn{H6937}{(H8686)} for him, and all the trees{H6086} of the field{H7704} fainted{H5969} for him."
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations{H1471} to shake{H7493}{(H8689)} at the sound{H6963} of his fall{H4658}, when I cast him down{H3381}{(H8687)} to hell{H7585} with them that descend{H3381}{(H8802)} into the pit{H953}: and all the trees{H6086} of Eden{H5731}, the choice{H4005} and best{H2896} of Lebanon{H3844}, all that drink{H8354}{(H8802)} water{H4325}, shall be comforted{H5162}{(H8735)} in the nether parts{H8482} of the earth{H776}."
Ezekiel,31,17,"They also went down{H3381}{(H8804)} into hell{H7585} with him unto them that be slain{H2491} with the sword{H2719}; and they that were his arm{H2220}, that dwelt{H3427}{(H8804)} under his shadow{H6738} in the midst{H8432} of the heathen{H1471}."
Ezekiel,31,18,"To whom art thou thus like{H1819}{(H8804)} in glory{H3519} and in greatness{H1433} among the trees{H6086} of Eden{H5731}? yet shalt thou be brought down{H3381}{(H8717)} with the trees{H6086} of Eden{H5731} unto the nether parts{H8482} of the earth{H776}: thou shalt lie{H7901}{(H8799)} in the midst{H8432} of the uncircumcised{H6189} with them that be slain{H2491} by the sword{H2719}. This is Pharaoh{H6547} and all his multitude{H1995}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,32,1,"And it came to pass in the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} year{H8141}, in the twelfth month{H2320}, in the first{H259} day of the month{H2320}, that the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,32,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, take up{H5375}{(H8798)} a lamentation{H7015} for Pharaoh{H6547} king{H4428} of Egypt{H4714}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto him, Thou art like{H1819}{(H8738)} a young lion{H3715} of the nations{H1471}, and thou art as a whale{H8577}{(H8676)}{H8565} in the seas{H3220}: and thou camest forth{H1518}{(H8799)} with thy rivers{H5104}, and troubledst{H1804}{(H8799)} the waters{H4325} with thy feet{H7272}, and fouledst{H7515}{(H8799)} their rivers{H5104}."
Ezekiel,32,3,Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will therefore spread out{H6566}{(H8804)} my net{H7568} over thee with a company{H6951} of many{H7227} people{H5971}; and they shall bring thee up{H5927}{(H8689)} in my net{H2764}.
Ezekiel,32,4,"Then will I leave{H5203}{(H8804)} thee upon the land{H776}, I will cast thee forth{H2904}{(H8686)} upon the open{H6440} field{H7704}, and will cause all the fowls{H5775} of the heaven{H8064} to remain{H7931}{(H8689)} upon thee, and I will fill{H7646}{(H8689)} the beasts{H2416} of the whole earth{H776} with thee."

Ezekiel,32,6,"I will also water{H8248}{(H8689)} with thy blood{H1818} the land{H776} wherein thou swimmest{H6824}, even to the mountains{H2022}; and the rivers{H650} shall be full{H4390}{(H8735)} of thee."
Ezekiel,32,7,"And when I shall put thee out{H3518}{(H8763)}, I will cover{H3680}{(H8765)} the heaven{H8064}, and make{H6937} the stars{H3556} thereof dark{H6937}{(H8689)}; I will cover{H3680}{(H8762)} the sun{H8121} with a cloud{H6051}, and the moon{H3394} shall not give{H215}{(H8686)} her light{H216}."
Ezekiel,32,8,"All the bright{H3974} lights{H216} of heaven{H8064} will I make dark{H6937}{(H8686)} over thee, and set{H5414}{(H8804)} darkness{H2822} upon thy land{H776}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,32,9,"I will also vex{H3707}{(H8689)} the hearts{H3820} of many{H7227} people{H5971}, when I shall bring{H935}{(H8687)} thy destruction{H7667} among the nations{H1471}, into the countries{H776} which thou hast not known{H3045}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,32,10,"Yea, I will make many{H7227} people{H5971} amazed{H8074}{(H8689)} at thee, and their kings{H4428} shall be horribly{H8178} afraid{H8175}{(H8799)} for thee, when I shall brandish{H5774}{(H8788)} my sword{H2719} before them{H6440}; and they shall tremble{H2729}{(H8804)} at every moment{H7281}, every man{H376} for his own life{H5315}, in the day{H3117} of thy fall{H4658}."

Ezekiel,32,24,"There is Elam{H5867} and all her multitude{H1995} round about{H5439} her grave{H6900}, all of them slain{H2491}, fallen{H5307}{(H8802)} by the sword{H2719}, which are gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} uncircumcised{H6189} into the nether parts{H8482} of the earth{H776}, which caused{H5414}{(H8804)} their terror{H2851} in the land{H776} of the living{H2416}; yet have they borne{H5375}{(H8799)} their shame{H3639} with them that go down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the pit{H953}."
Ezekiel,32,25,"They have set{H5414}{(H8804)} her a bed{H4904} in the midst{H8432} of the slain{H2491} with all her multitude{H1995}: her graves{H6913} are round about{H5439} him: all of them uncircumcised{H6189}, slain{H2491} by the sword{H2719}: though their terror{H2851} was caused{H5414}{(H8737)} in the land{H776} of the living{H2416}, yet have they borne{H5375}{(H8799)} their shame{H3639} with them that go down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the pit{H953}: he is put{H5414}{(H8738)} in the midst{H8432} of them that be slain{H2491}."
Ezekiel,32,26,"There is Meshech{H4902}, Tubal{H8422}, and all her multitude{H1995}: her graves{H6913} are round about{H5439} him: all of them uncircumcised{H6189}, slain{H2490}{(H8794)} by the sword{H2719}, though they caused{H5414}{(H8804)} their terror{H2851} in the land{H776} of the living{H2416}."
Ezekiel,32,27,"And they shall not lie{H7901}{(H8799)} with the mighty{H1368} that are fallen{H5307}{(H8802)} of the uncircumcised{H6189}, which are gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} to hell{H7585} with their weapons{H3627} of war{H4421}: and they have laid{H5414}{(H8799)} their swords{H2719} under their heads{H7218}, but their iniquities{H5771} shall be upon their bones{H6106}, though they were the terror{H2851} of the mighty{H1368} in the land{H776} of the living{H2416}."
Ezekiel,32,28,"Yea, thou shalt be broken{H7665}{(H8735)} in the midst{H8432} of the uncircumcised{H6189}, and shalt lie{H7901}{(H8799)} with them that are slain{H2491} with the sword{H2719}."
Ezekiel,32,29,"There is Edom{H123}, her kings{H4428}, and all her princes{H5387}, which with their might{H1369} are laid{H5414}{(H8738)} by them that were slain{H2491} by the sword{H2719}: they shall lie{H7901}{(H8799)} with the uncircumcised{H6189}, and with them that go down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the pit{H953}."
Ezekiel,32,30,"There be the princes{H5257} of the north{H6828}, all of them, and all the Zidonians{H6722}, which are gone down{H3381}{(H8804)} with the slain{H2491}; with their terror{H2851} they are ashamed{H954}{(H8802)} of their might{H1369}; and they lie{H7901}{(H8799)} uncircumcised{H6189} with them that be slain{H2491} by the sword{H2719}, and bear{H5375}{(H8799)} their shame{H3639} with them that go down{H3381}{(H8802)} to the pit{H953}."
Ezekiel,32,31,"Pharaoh{H6547} shall see{H7200}{(H8799)} them, and shall be comforted{H5162}{(H8738)} over all his multitude{H1995}, even Pharaoh{H6547} and all his army{H2428} slain{H2491} by the sword{H2719}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,32,32,"For I have caused{H5414}{(H8804)} my terror{H2851} in the land{H776} of the living{H2416}: and he shall be laid{H7901}{(H8717)} in the midst{H8432} of the uncircumcised{H6189} with them that are slain{H2491} with the sword{H2719}, even Pharaoh{H6547} and all his multitude{H1995}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,33,1,"Again the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,33,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, speak{H1696}{(H8761)} to the children{H1121} of thy people{H5971}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, When I bring{H935}{(H8686)} the sword{H2719} upon a land{H776}, if the people{H5971} of the land{H776} take{H3947}{(H8804)} a{H259} man{H376} of their coasts{H7097}, and set{H5414}{(H8804)} him for their watchman{H6822}{(H8802)}:"
Ezekiel,33,3,"If when he seeth{H7200}{(H8804)} the sword{H2719} come{H935}{(H8802)} upon the land{H776}, he blow{H8628}{(H8804)} the trumpet{H7782}, and warn{H2094}{(H8689)} the people{H5971};"
Ezekiel,33,4,"Then whosoever{H8085}{(H8802)} heareth{H8085}{(H8804)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, and taketh not warning{H2094}{(H8737)}; if the sword{H2719} come{H935}{(H8799)}, and take him away{H3947}{(H8799)}, his blood{H1818} shall be upon his own head{H7218}."
Ezekiel,33,5,"He heard{H8085}{(H8804)} the sound{H6963} of the trumpet{H7782}, and took not warning{H2094}{(H8737)}; his blood{H1818} shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning{H2094}{(H8737)} shall deliver{H4422}{(H8765)} his soul{H5315}."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} see{H7200}{(H8799)} the sword{H2719} come{H935}{(H8802)}, and blow{H8628}{(H8804)} not the trumpet{H7782}, and the people{H5971} be not warned{H2094}{(H8737)}; if the sword{H2719} come{H935}{(H8799)}, and take{H3947}{(H8799)} any person{H5315} from among them, he is taken away{H3947}{(H8738)} in his iniquity{H5771}; but his blood{H1818} will I require{H1875}{(H8799)} at the watchman's{H6822}{(H8802)} hand{H3027}."
Ezekiel,33,7,"So thou, O son{H1121} of man{H120}, I have set{H5414}{(H8804)} thee a watchman{H6822}{(H8802)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; therefore thou shalt hear{H8085}{(H8804)} the word{H1697} at my mouth{H6310}, and warn{H2094}{(H8689)} them from me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I say{H559}{(H8800)} unto the wicked{H7563}, O wicked{H7563} man, thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}; if thou dost not speak{H1696}{(H8765)} to warn{H2094}{(H8687)} the wicked{H7563} from his way{H1870}, that wicked{H7563} man shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} in his iniquity{H5771}; but his blood{H1818} will I require{H1245}{(H8762)} at thine hand{H3027}."
Ezekiel,33,9,"Nevertheless, if thou warn{H2094}{(H8689)} the wicked{H7563} of his way{H1870} to turn{H7725}{(H8800)} from it; if he do not turn{H7725}{(H8804)} from his way{H1870}, he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} in his iniquity{H5771}; but thou hast delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} thy soul{H5315}."
Ezekiel,33,10,"Therefore, O thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, speak{H559}{(H8798)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}; Thus ye speak{H559}{(H8804)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, If our transgressions{H6588} and our sins{H2403} be upon us, and we pine away{H4743}{(H8737)} in them, how should we then live{H2421}{(H8799)}?"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say{H559}{(H8798)} unto them, As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, I have no pleasure{H2654}{(H8799)} in the death{H4194} of the wicked{H7563}; but that the wicked{H7563} turn{H7725}{(H8800)} from his way{H1870} and live{H2421}{(H8804)}: turn{H7725}{(H8798)} ye, turn{H7725}{(H8798)} ye from your evil{H7451} ways{H1870}; for why will ye die{H4191}{(H8799)}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}?"
Ezekiel,33,12,"Therefore, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, say{H559}{(H8798)} unto the children{H1121} of thy people{H5971}, The righteousness{H6666} of the righteous{H6662} shall not deliver{H5337}{(H8686)} him in the day{H3117} of his transgression{H6588}: as for the wickedness{H7564} of the wicked{H7563}, he shall not fall{H3782}{(H8735)} thereby in the day{H3117} that he turneth{H7725}{(H8800)} from his wickedness{H7562}; neither shall the righteous{H6662} be able{H3201}{(H8799)} to live{H2421}{(H8800)} for his righteousness in the day{H3117} that he sinneth{H2398}{(H8800)}."
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I shall say{H559}{(H8800)} to the righteous{H6662}, that he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}; if he trust{H982}{(H8804)} to his own righteousness{H6666}, and commit{H6213}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}, all his righteousnesses{H6666} shall not be remembered{H2142}{(H8735)}; but for his iniquity{H5766} that he hath committed{H6213}{(H8804)}, he shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} for it."
Ezekiel,33,14,"Again, when I say{H559}{(H8800)} unto the wicked{H7563}, Thou shalt surely{H4191}{(H8800)} die{H4191}{(H8799)}; if he turn{H7725}{(H8804)} from his sin{H2403}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} that which is lawful{H4941} and right{H6666};"
Ezekiel,33,15,"If the wicked{H7563} restore{H7725}{(H8686)} the pledge{H2258}, give again{H7999}{(H8762)} that he had robbed{H1500}, walk{H1980}{(H8804)} in the statutes{H2708} of life{H2416}, without committing{H6213}{(H8800)} iniquity{H5766}; he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}, he shall not die{H4191}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins{H2403} that he hath committed{H2398}{(H8804)} shall be mentioned{H2142}{(H8735)} unto him: he hath done{H6213}{(H8804)} that which is lawful{H4941} and right{H6666}; he shall surely{H2421}{(H8800)} live{H2421}{(H8799)}.
Ezekiel,33,17,"Yet the children{H1121} of thy people{H5971} say{H559}{(H8804)}, The way{H1870} of the Lord{H136} is not equal{H8505}{(H8735)}: but as for them, their way{H1870} is not equal{H8505}{(H8735)}."
Ezekiel,33,18,"When the righteous{H6662} turneth{H7725}{(H8800)} from his righteousness{H6666}, and committeth{H6213}{(H8804)} iniquity{H5766}, he shall even die{H4191}{(H8804)} thereby."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But if the wicked{H7563} turn{H7725}{(H8800)} from his wickedness{H7564}, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} that which is lawful{H4941} and right{H6666}, he shall live{H2421}{(H8799)} thereby."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet ye say{H559}{(H8804)}, The way{H1870} of the Lord{H136} is not equal{H8505}{(H8735)}. O ye house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, I will judge{H8199}{(H8799)} you every one{H376} after his ways{H1870}."
Ezekiel,33,21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth{H8147}{H6240} year{H8141} of our captivity{H1546}, in the tenth{H6224} month, in the fifth{H2568} day of the month{H2320}, that one that had escaped{H6412} out of Jerusalem{H3389} came{H935}{(H8804)} unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, The city{H5892} is smitten{H5221}{(H8717)}."
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was upon me in the evening{H6153}, afore{H6440} he that was escaped{H6412} came{H935}{(H8800)}; and had opened{H6605}{(H8799)} my mouth{H6310}, until he came{H935}{(H8800)} to me in the morning{H1242}; and my mouth{H6310} was opened{H6605}{(H8735)}, and I was no more dumb{H481}{(H8738)}."
Ezekiel,33,23,"Then the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,33,24,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, they that inhabit{H3427}{(H8802)} those wastes{H2723} of the land{H127} of Israel{H3478} speak{H559}{(H8802)}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Abraham{H85} was one{H259}, and he inherited{H3423}{(H8799)} the land{H776}: but we are many{H7227}; the land{H776} is given{H5414}{(H8738)} us for inheritance{H4181}."
Ezekiel,33,25,"Wherefore say{H559}{(H8798)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Ye eat{H398}{(H8799)} with the blood{H1818}, and lift up{H5375}{(H8799)} your eyes{H5869} toward your idols{H1544}, and shed{H8210}{(H8799)} blood{H1818}: and shall ye possess{H3423}{(H8799)} the land{H776}?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"Ye stand{H5975}{(H8804)} upon your sword{H2719}, ye work{H6213}{(H8804)} abomination{H8441}, and ye defile{H2930}{(H8765)} every one{H376} his neighbour's{H7453} wife{H802}: and shall ye possess{H3423}{(H8799)} the land{H776}?"
Ezekiel,33,27,"Say{H559}{(H8799)} thou thus unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; As I live{H2416}, surely they that are in the wastes{H2723} shall fall{H5307}{(H8799)} by the sword{H2719}, and him that is in the open{H6440} field{H7704} will I give{H5414}{(H8804)} to the beasts{H2416} to be devoured{H398}{(H8800)}, and they that be in the forts{H4679} and in the caves{H4631} shall die{H4191}{(H8799)} of the pestilence{H1698}."
Ezekiel,33,28,"For I will lay{H5414}{(H8804)} the land{H776} most{H4923} desolate{H8077}, and the pomp{H1347} of her strength{H5797} shall cease{H7673}{(H8738)}; and the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478} shall be desolate{H8074}{(H8804)}, that none shall pass through{H5674}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then shall they know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I have laid{H5414}{(H8800)} the land{H776} most{H4923} desolate{H8077} because of all their abominations{H8441} which they have committed{H6213}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,33,30,"Also, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, the children{H1121} of thy people{H5971} still are talking{H1696}{(H8737)} against{H681} thee by the walls{H7023} and in the doors{H6607} of the houses{H1004}, and speak{H1696}{(H8765)} one{H2297} to another{H259}, every one{H376} to his brother{H251}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, Come{H935}{(H8798)}, I pray you, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} what is the word{H1697} that cometh forth{H3318}{(H8802)} from the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,33,31,"And they come{H935}{(H8799)} unto thee as the people{H5971} cometh{H3996}, and they sit{H3427}{(H8799)} before{H6440} thee as my people{H5971}, and they hear{H8085}{(H8804)} thy words{H1697}, but they will not do{H6213}{(H8799)} them: for with their mouth{H6310} they shew{H6213}{(H8802)} much love{H5690}, but their heart{H3820} goeth{H1980}{(H8802)} after{H310} their covetousness{H1215}."
Ezekiel,33,32,"And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely{H5690} song{H7892} of one that hath a pleasant{H3303} voice{H6963}, and can play well{H2895}{(H8688)} on an instrument{H5059}{(H8763)}: for they hear{H8085}{(H8804)} thy words{H1697}, but they do{H6213}{(H8802)} them not."
Ezekiel,33,33,"And when this cometh to pass{H935}{(H8800)},(lo, it will come{H935}{(H8802)},) then shall they know{H3045}{(H8804)} that a prophet{H5030} hath been among{H8432} them."
Ezekiel,34,1,"And the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,34,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} of Israel{H3478}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} unto the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}; Woe{H1945} be to the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} of Israel{H3478} that do feed{H7462}{(H8802)} themselves! should not the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} feed{H7462}{(H8799)} the flocks{H6629}?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"Ye eat{H398}{(H8799)} the fat{H2459}, and ye clothe{H3847}{(H8799)} you with the wool{H6785}, ye kill{H2076}{(H8799)} them that are fed{H1277}: but ye feed{H7462}{(H8799)} not the flock{H6629}."
Ezekiel,34,4,"The diseased{H2470}{(H8737)} have ye not strengthened{H2388}{(H8765)}, neither have ye healed{H7495}{(H8765)} that which was sick{H2470}{(H8802)}, neither have ye bound up{H2280}{(H8804)} that which was broken{H7665}{(H8737)}, neither have ye brought again{H7725}{(H8689)} that which was driven away{H5080}{(H8737)}, neither have ye sought{H1245}{(H8765)} that which was lost{H6}{(H8802)}; but with force{H2394} and with cruelty{H6531} have ye ruled{H7287}{(H8804)} them."
Ezekiel,34,5,"And they were scattered{H6327}{(H8799)}, because there is no shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)}: and they became meat{H402} to all the beasts{H2416} of the field{H7704}, when they were scattered{H6327}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheep{H6629} wandered{H7686}{(H8799)} through all the mountains{H2022}, and upon every high{H7311}{(H8802)} hill{H1389}: yea, my flock{H6629} was scattered{H6327}{(H8738)} upon all the face{H6440} of the earth{H776}, and none did search{H1875}{(H8802)} or seek{H1245}{(H8764)} after them."
Ezekiel,34,7,"Therefore, ye shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068};"
Ezekiel,34,8,"As I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, surely because my flock{H6629} became a prey{H957}, and my flock{H6629} became meat{H402} to every beast{H2416} of the field{H7704}, because there was no shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)}, neither did my shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} search{H1875}{(H8804)} for my flock{H6629}, but the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} fed{H7462}{(H8799)} themselves, and fed{H7462}{(H8804)} not my flock{H6629};"
Ezekiel,34,9,"Therefore, O ye shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068};"
Ezekiel,34,10,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I am against the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)}; and I will require{H1875}{(H8804)} my flock{H6629} at their hand{H3027}, and cause them to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} from feeding{H7462}{(H8800)} the flock{H6629}; neither shall the shepherds{H7462}{(H8802)} feed{H7462}{(H8799)} themselves any more; for I will deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} my flock{H6629} from their mouth{H6310}, that they may not be meat{H402} for them."
Ezekiel,34,11,"For thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I, even I, will both search{H1875}{(H8804)} my sheep{H6629}, and seek them out{H1239}{(H8765)}."
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)} seeketh out{H1243} his flock{H5739} in the day{H3117} that he is among{H8432} his sheep{H6629} that are scattered{H6567}{(H8737)}; so will I seek out{H1239}{(H8762)} my sheep{H6629}, and will deliver{H5337}{(H8689)} them out of all places{H4725} where they have been scattered{H6327}{(H8738)} in the cloudy{H6051} and dark{H6205} day{H3117}."
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I will bring them out{H3318}{(H8689)} from the people{H5971}, and gather{H6908}{(H8765)} them from the countries{H776}, and will bring{H935}{(H8689)} them to their own land{H127}, and feed{H7462}{(H8804)} them upon the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478} by the rivers{H650}, and in all the inhabited places{H4186} of the country{H776}."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feed{H7462}{(H8799)} them in a good{H2896} pasture{H4829}, and upon the high{H4791} mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478} shall their fold{H5116} be: there shall they lie{H7257}{(H8799)} in a good{H2896} fold{H5116}, and in a fat{H8082} pasture{H4829} shall they feed{H7462}{(H8799)} upon the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feed{H7462}{(H8799)} my flock{H6629}, and I will cause them to lie down{H7257}{(H8686)}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,34,16,"I will seek{H1245}{(H8762)} that which was lost{H6}{(H8802)}, and bring again{H7725}{(H8686)} that which was driven away{H5080}{(H8737)}, and will bind up{H2280}{(H8799)} that which was broken{H7665}{(H8737)}, and will strengthen{H2388}{(H8762)} that which was sick{H2470}{(H8802)}: but I will destroy{H8045}{(H8686)} the fat{H8082} and the strong{H2389}; I will feed{H7462}{(H8799)} them with judgment{H4941}."
Ezekiel,34,17,"And as for you{H859}, O my flock{H6629}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, I judge{H8199}{(H8802)} between cattle{H7716} and cattle{H7716}, between the rams{H352} and the he goats{H6260}."
Ezekiel,34,18,"Seemeth it a small thing{H4592} unto you to have eaten up{H7462}{(H8799)} the good{H2896} pasture{H4829}, but ye must tread down{H7429}{(H8799)} with your feet{H7272} the residue{H3499} of your pastures{H4829}? and to have drunk{H8354}{(H8799)} of the deep{H4950} waters{H4325}, but ye must foul{H7515}{(H8799)} the residue{H3498}{(H8737)} with your feet{H7272}?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"And as for my flock{H6629}, they eat{H7462}{(H8799)} that which ye have trodden{H4823} with your feet{H7272}; and they drink{H8354}{(H8799)} that which ye have fouled{H4833} with your feet{H7272}."
Ezekiel,34,20,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge{H8199}{(H8804)} between the fat{H1274} cattle{H7716} and between the lean{H7330} cattle{H7716}."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because ye have thrust{H1920}{(H8799)} with side{H6654} and with shoulder{H3802}, and pushed{H5055}{(H8762)} all the diseased{H2470}{(H8737)} with your horns{H7161}, till ye have scattered{H6327}{(H8689)} them abroad{H2351};"
Ezekiel,34,22,"Therefore will I save{H3467}{(H8689)} my flock{H6629}, and they shall no more be a prey{H957}; and I will judge{H8199}{(H8804)} between cattle{H7716} and cattle{H7716}."
Ezekiel,34,23,"And I will set up{H6965}{(H8689)} one{H259} shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)} over them, and he shall feed{H7462}{(H8804)} them, even my servant{H5650} David{H1732}; he shall feed{H7462}{(H8799)} them, and he shall be their shepherd{H7462}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I the LORD{H3068} will be their God{H430}, and my servant{H5650} David{H1732} a prince{H5387} among{H8432} them; I the LORD{H3068} have spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,34,25,"And I will make{H3772}{(H8804)} with them a covenant{H1285} of peace{H7965}, and will cause the evil{H7451} beasts{H2416} to cease{H7673}{(H8689)} out of the land{H776}: and they shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} safely{H983} in the wilderness{H4057}, and sleep{H3462}{(H8804)} in the woods{H3293}{(H8675)}{H3264}."
Ezekiel,34,26,And I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} them and the places round about{H5439} my hill{H1389} a blessing{H1293}; and I will cause the shower{H1653} to come down{H3381}{(H8689)} in his season{H6256}; there shall be showers{H1653} of blessing{H1293}.
Ezekiel,34,27,"And the tree{H6086} of the field{H7704} shall yield{H5414}{(H8804)} her fruit{H6529}, and the earth{H776} shall yield{H5414}{(H8799)} her increase{H2981}, and they shall be safe{H983} in their land{H127}, and shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, when I have broken{H7665}{(H8800)} the bands{H4133} of their yoke{H5923}, and delivered{H5337}{(H8689)} them out of the hand{H3027} of those that served{H5647}{(H8802)} themselves of them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"And they shall no more be a prey{H957} to the heathen{H1471}, neither shall the beast{H2416} of the land{H776} devour{H398}{(H8799)} them; but they shall dwell{H3427}{(H8804)} safely{H983}, and none shall make them afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}."
Ezekiel,34,29,"And I will raise up{H6965}{(H8689)} for them a plant{H4302} of renown{H8034}, and they shall be no more consumed{H622}{(H8803)} with hunger{H7458} in the land{H776}, neither bear{H5375}{(H8799)} the shame{H3639} of the heathen{H1471} any more."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Thus shall they know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} am with them, and that they, even the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, are my people{H5971}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,34,31,"And ye{H859} my flock{H6629}, the flock{H6629} of my pasture{H4830}, are men{H120}, and I am your God{H430}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,35,1,"Moreover the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came unto me, saying{H559}{(H8800)},"
Ezekiel,35,2,"Son{H1121} of man{H120}, set{H7760}{(H8798)} thy face{H6440} against mount{H2022} Seir{H8165}, and prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} against it,"
Ezekiel,35,3,"And say{H559}{(H8804)} unto it, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, O mount{H2022} Seir{H8165}, I am against thee, and I will stretch out{H5186}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} against thee, and I will make{H5414}{(H8804)} thee most{H4923} desolate{H8077}."
Ezekiel,35,4,"I will lay{H7760}{(H8799)} thy cities{H5892} waste{H2723}, and thou shalt be desolate{H8077}, and thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,35,5,"Because thou hast had a perpetual{H5769} hatred{H342}, and hast shed{H5064}{(H8686)} the blood of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} by the force{H3027} of the sword{H2719} in the time{H6256} of their calamity{H343}, in the time{H6256} that their iniquity{H5771} had an end{H7093}:"
Ezekiel,35,6,"Therefore, as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, I will prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} thee unto blood{H1818}, and blood{H1818} shall pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} thee: sith{H518} thou hast not hated{H8130}{(H8804)} blood{H1818}, even blood{H1818} shall pursue{H7291}{(H8799)} thee."
Ezekiel,35,7,"Thus will I make{H5414}{(H8804)} mount{H2022} Seir{H8165} most{H8077} desolate{H8077}, and cut off{H3772}{(H8689)} from it him that passeth out{H5674}{(H8802)} and him that returneth{H7725}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,35,8,"And I will fill{H4390}{(H8765)} his mountains{H2022} with his slain{H2491} men: in thy hills{H1389}, and in thy valleys{H1516}, and in all thy rivers{H650}, shall they fall{H5307}{(H8799)} that are slain{H2491} with the sword{H2719}."
Ezekiel,35,9,"I will make{H5414}{(H8799)} thee perpetual{H5769} desolations{H8077}, and thy cities{H5892} shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H3427}{(H8799)}: and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,35,10,"Because thou hast said{H559}{(H8800)}, These two{H8147} nations{H1471} and these two{H8147} countries{H776} shall be mine, and we will possess{H3423}{(H8804)} it; whereas the LORD{H3068} was there:"
Ezekiel,35,11,"Therefore, as I live{H2416}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, I will even do{H6213}{(H8804)} according to thine anger{H639}, and according to thine envy{H7068} which thou hast used{H6213}{(H8804)} out of thy hatred{H8135} against them; and I will make myself known{H3045}{(H8738)} among them, when I have judged{H8199}{(H8799)} thee."
Ezekiel,35,12,"And thou shalt know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, and that I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} all thy blasphemies{H5007} which thou hast spoken{H559}{(H8804)} against the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, saying{H559}{(H8800)}, They are laid desolate{H8074}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H8077}, they are given{H5414}{(H8738)} us to consume{H402}."
Ezekiel,35,13,"Thus with your mouth{H6310} ye have boasted{H1431}{(H8686)} against me, and have multiplied{H6280}{(H8689)} your words{H1697} against me: I have heard{H8085}{(H8804)} them."
Ezekiel,35,14,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; When the whole earth{H776} rejoiceth{H8055}{(H8800)}, I will make{H6213}{(H8799)} thee desolate{H8077}."
Ezekiel,35,15,"As thou didst rejoice{H8057} at the inheritance{H5159} of the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, because it was desolate{H8074}{(H8804)}, so will I do{H6213}{(H8799)} unto thee: thou shalt be desolate{H8077}, O mount{H2022} Seir{H8165}, and all Idumea{H123}, even all of it: and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,36,1,"Also, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} unto the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Ye mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}:"
Ezekiel,36,2,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because the enemy{H341}{(H8802)} hath said{H559}{(H8804)} against you, Aha{H1889}, even the ancient{H5769} high places{H1116} are ours in possession{H4181}:"
Ezekiel,36,3,"Therefore prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} and say{H559}{(H8804)}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Because they have made you desolate{H8074}{(H8800)}, and swallowed you up{H7602}{(H8800)} on every side{H5439}, that ye might be a possession{H4181} unto the residue{H7611} of the heathen{H1471}, and ye are taken up{H5927}{(H8735)} in the lips{H8193} of talkers{H3956}, and are an infamy{H1681} of the people{H5971}:"
Ezekiel,36,4,"Therefore, ye mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} to the mountains{H2022}, and to the hills{H1389}, to the rivers{H650}, and to the valleys{H1516}, to the desolate{H8074}{(H8802)} wastes{H2723}, and to the cities{H5892} that are forsaken{H5800}{(H8737)}, which became a prey{H957} and derision{H3933} to the residue{H7611} of the heathen{H1471} that are round about{H5439};"
Ezekiel,36,5,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Surely in the fire{H784} of my jealousy{H7068} have I spoken{H1696}{(H8765)} against the residue{H7611} of the heathen{H1471}, and against all Idumea{H123}, which have appointed{H5414}{(H8804)} my land{H776} into their possession{H4181} with the joy{H8057} of all their heart{H3824}, with despiteful{H7589} minds{H5315}, to cast it out{H4054} for a prey{H957}."

Ezekiel,36,18,"Wherefore I poured{H8210}{(H8799)} my fury{H2534} upon them for the blood{H1818} that they had shed{H8210}{(H8804)} upon the land{H776}, and for their idols{H1544} wherewith they had polluted{H2930}{(H8765)} it:"
Ezekiel,36,19,"And I scattered{H6327}{(H8686)} them among the heathen{H1471}, and they were dispersed{H2219}{(H8735)} through the countries{H776}: according to their way{H1870} and according to their doings{H5949} I judged{H8199}{(H8804)} them."
Ezekiel,36,20,"And when they entered{H935}{(H8799)} unto the heathen{H1471}, whither they went{H935}{(H8804)}, they profaned{H2490}{(H8762)} my holy{H6944} name{H8034}, when they said{H559}{(H8800)} to them, These are the people{H5971} of the LORD{H3068}, and are gone forth{H3318}{(H8804)} out of his land{H776}."
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I had pity{H2550}{(H8799)} for mine holy{H6944} name{H8034}, which the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} had profaned{H2490}{(H8765)} among the heathen{H1471}, whither they went{H935}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,36,22,"Therefore say{H559}{(H8798)} unto the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I do{H6213}{(H8802)} not this for your sakes, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, but for mine holy{H6944} name's{H8034} sake, which ye have profaned{H2490}{(H8765)} among the heathen{H1471}, whither ye went{H935}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,36,23,"And I will sanctify{H6942}{(H8765)} my great{H1419} name{H8034}, which was profaned{H2490}{(H8794)} among the heathen{H1471}, which ye have profaned{H2490}{(H8765)} in the midst{H8432} of them; and the heathen{H1471} shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, when I shall be sanctified{H6942}{(H8736)} in you before their eyes{H5869}."

Ezekiel,36,32,"Not for your sakes do{H6213}{(H8802)} I this, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, be it known{H3045}{(H8735)} unto you: be ashamed{H954}{(H8798)} and confounded{H3637}{(H8734)} for your own ways{H1870}, O house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,36,33,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; In the day{H3117} that I shall have cleansed{H2891}{(H8763)} you from all your iniquities{H5771} I will also cause you to dwell{H3427}{(H8689)} in the cities{H5892}, and the wastes{H2723} shall be builded{H1129}{(H8738)}."
Ezekiel,36,34,"And the desolate{H8074}{(H8737)} land{H776} shall be tilled{H5647}{(H8735)}, whereas it lay desolate{H8077} in the sight{H5869} of all that passed by{H5674}{(H8802)}."
Ezekiel,36,35,"And they shall say{H559}{(H8804)}, This{H1977} land{H776} that was desolate{H8074}{(H8737)} is become like the garden{H1588} of Eden{H5731}; and the waste{H2720} and desolate{H8074}{(H8737)} and ruined{H2040}{(H8737)} cities{H5892} are become fenced{H1219}{(H8803)}, and are inhabited{H3427}{(H8804)}."

Ezekiel,36,37,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; I will yet for this be enquired{H1875}{(H8735)} of by the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, to do{H6213}{(H8800)} it for them; I will increase{H7235}{(H8686)} them with men{H120} like a flock{H6629}."
Ezekiel,36,38,"As the holy{H6944} flock{H6629}, as the flock{H6629} of Jerusalem{H3389} in her solemn feasts{H4150}; so shall the waste{H2720} cities{H5892} be filled{H4392} with flocks{H6629} of men{H120}: and they shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was upon me, and carried me out{H3318}{(H8686)} in the spirit{H7307} of the LORD{H3068}, and set me down{H5117}{(H8686)} in the midst{H8432} of the valley{H1237} which was full{H4392} of bones{H6106},"
Ezekiel,37,2,"And caused me to pass{H5674}{(H8689)} by them round about{H5439}: and, behold, there were very{H3966} many{H7227} in the open{H6440} valley{H1237}; and, lo, they were very{H3966} dry{H3002}."
Ezekiel,37,3,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, can these bones{H6106} live{H2421}{(H8799)}? And I answered{H559}{(H8799)}, O Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, thou knowest{H3045}{(H8804)}."
Ezekiel,37,4,"Again he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} upon these bones{H6106}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, O ye dry{H3002} bones{H6106}, hear{H8085}{(H8798)} the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,37,5,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069} unto these bones{H6106}; Behold, I will cause breath{H7307} to enter{H935}{(H8688)} into you, and ye shall live{H2421}{(H8804)}:"
Ezekiel,37,6,"And I will lay{H5414}{(H8804)} sinews{H1517} upon you, and will bring up{H5927}{(H8689)} flesh{H1320} upon you, and cover{H7159}{(H8804)} you with skin{H5785}, and put{H5414}{(H8804)} breath{H7307} in you, and ye shall live{H2421}{(H8804)}; and ye shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied{H5012}{(H8738)} as I was commanded{H6680}{(H8795)}: and as I prophesied{H5012}{(H8736)}, there was a noise{H6963}, and behold a shaking{H7494}, and the bones{H6106} came together{H7126}{(H8799)}, bone{H6106} to his bone{H6106}."
Ezekiel,37,8,"And when I beheld{H7200}{(H8804)}, lo, the sinews{H1517} and the flesh{H1320} came up{H5927}{(H8804)} upon them, and the skin{H5785} covered{H7159}{(H8799)} them above{H4605}: but there was no breath{H7307} in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, Prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} unto the wind{H7307}, prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)}, son{H1121} of man{H120}, and say{H559}{(H8804)} to the wind{H7307}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Come{H935}{(H8798)} from the four{H702} winds{H7307}, O breath{H7307}, and breathe{H5301}{(H8798)} upon these slain{H2026}{(H8803)}, that they may live{H2421}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied{H5012}{(H8694)} as he commanded{H6680}{(H8765)} me, and the breath{H7307} came{H935}{(H8799)} into them, and they lived{H2421}{(H8799)}, and stood up{H5975}{(H8799)} upon their feet{H7272}, an exceeding{H3966}{H3966} great{H1419} army{H2428}."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, these bones{H6106} are the whole house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}: behold, they say{H559}{(H8802)}, Our bones{H6106} are dried{H3001}{(H8804)}, and our hope{H8615} is lost{H6}{(H8804)}: we are cut off{H1504}{(H8738)} for our parts."
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy{H5012}{(H8734)} and say{H559}{(H8804)} unto them, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Behold, O my people{H5971}, I will open{H6605}{(H8802)} your graves{H6913}, and cause you to come up{H5927}{(H8689)} out of your graves{H6913}, and bring{H935}{(H8689)} you into the land{H127} of Israel{H3478}."

Ezekiel,39,16,And also the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} shall be Hamonah{H1997}. Thus shall they cleanse{H2891}{(H8765)} the land{H776}.
Ezekiel,39,17,"And, thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Speak{H559}{(H8798)} unto every feathered{H3671} fowl{H6833}, and to every beast{H2416} of the field{H7704}, Assemble{H6908}{(H8734)} yourselves, and come{H935}{(H8798)}; gather{H622}{(H8734)} yourselves on every side{H5439} to my sacrifice{H2077} that I do sacrifice{H2076}{(H8802)} for you, even a great{H1419} sacrifice{H2077} upon the mountains{H2022} of Israel{H3478}, that ye may eat{H398}{(H8804)} flesh{H1320}, and drink{H8354}{(H8804)} blood{H1818}."
Ezekiel,39,18,"Ye shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} the flesh{H1320} of the mighty{H1368}, and drink{H8354}{(H8799)} the blood{H1818} of the princes{H5387} of the earth{H776}, of rams{H352}, of lambs{H3733}, and of goats{H6260}, of bullocks{H6499}, all of them fatlings{H4806} of Bashan{H1316}."

Ezekiel,39,20,"Thus ye shall be filled{H7646}{(H8804)} at my table{H7979} with horses{H5483} and chariots{H7393}, with mighty men{H1368}, and with all men{H376} of war{H4421}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,39,21,"And I will set{H5414}{(H8804)} my glory{H3519} among the heathen{H1471}, and all the heathen{H1471} shall see{H7200}{(H8804)} my judgment{H4941} that I have executed{H6213}{(H8804)}, and my hand{H3027} that I have laid{H7760}{(H8804)} upon them."
Ezekiel,39,22,So the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068} their God{H430} from that day{H3117} and forward{H1973}.
Ezekiel,39,23,"And the heathen{H1471} shall know{H3045}{(H8804)} that the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} went into captivity{H1540}{(H8804)} for their iniquity{H5771}: because they trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)} against me, therefore hid{H5641}{(H8686)} I my face{H6440} from them, and gave{H5414}{(H8799)} them into the hand{H3027} of their enemies{H6862}: so fell{H5307}{(H8799)} they all by the sword{H2719}."
Ezekiel,39,24,"According to their uncleanness{H2932} and according to their transgressions{H6588} have I done{H6213}{(H8804)} unto them, and hid{H5641}{(H8686)} my face{H6440} from them."
Ezekiel,39,25,"Therefore thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; Now will I bring again{H7725}{(H8686)} the captivity{H7622}{(H8675)}{H7622} of Jacob{H3290}, and have mercy{H7355}{(H8765)} upon the whole house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, and will be jealous{H7065}{(H8765)} for my holy{H6944} name{H8034};"
Ezekiel,39,26,"After that they have borne{H5375}{(H8804)} their shame{H3639}, and all their trespasses{H4604} whereby they have trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)} against me, when they dwelt{H3427}{(H8800)} safely{H983} in their land{H127}, and none made them afraid{H2729}{(H8688)}."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I have brought them again{H7725}{(H8788)} from the people{H5971}, and gathered{H6908}{(H8765)} them out of their enemies{H341}{(H8802)}' lands{H776}, and am sanctified{H6942}{(H8738)} in them in the sight{H5869} of many{H7227} nations{H1471};"
Ezekiel,39,28,"Then shall they know{H3045}{(H8804)} that I am the LORD{H3068} their God{H430}, which caused them to be led into captivity{H1540}{(H8687)} among the heathen{H1471}: but I have gathered{H3664}{(H8765)} them unto their own land{H127}, and have left{H3498}{(H8686)} none of them any more there."
Ezekiel,39,29,"Neither will I hide{H5641}{(H8686)} my face{H6440} any more from them: for I have poured out{H8210}{(H8804)} my spirit{H7307} upon the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the five{H2568} and twentieth{H6242} year{H8141} of our captivity{H1546}, in the beginning{H7218} of the year{H8141}, in the tenth{H6218} day of the month{H2320}, in the fourteenth{H702}{H6240} year{H8141} after{H310} that the city{H5892} was smitten{H5221}{(H8717)}, in the selfsame{H6106} day{H3117} the hand{H3027} of the LORD{H3068} was upon me, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} me thither."
Ezekiel,40,2,"In the visions{H4759} of God{H430} brought{H935}{(H8689)} he me into the land{H776} of Israel{H3478}, and set{H5117}{(H8686)} me upon a very{H3966} high{H1364} mountain{H2022}, by which was as the frame{H4011} of a city{H5892} on the south{H5045}."
Ezekiel,40,3,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me thither, and, behold, there was a man{H376}, whose appearance{H4758} was like the appearance{H4758} of brass{H5178}, with a line{H6616} of flax{H6593} in his hand{H3027}, and a measuring{H4060} reed{H7070}; and he stood{H5975}{(H8802)} in the gate{H8179}."
Ezekiel,40,4,"And the man{H376} said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, behold{H7200}{(H8798)} with thine eyes{H5869}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} with thine ears{H241}, and set{H7760}{(H8798)} thine heart{H3820} upon all that I shall shew{H7200}{(H8688)} thee; for to the intent{H4616} that I might shew{H7200}{(H8687)} them unto thee art thou brought{H935}{(H8717)} hither: declare{H5046}{(H8685)} all that thou seest{H7200}{(H8802)} to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,40,5,"And behold a wall{H2346} on the outside{H2351} of the house{H1004} round about{H5439}, and in the man's{H376} hand{H3027} a measuring{H4060} reed{H7070} of six{H8337} cubits{H520} long by the cubit{H520} and an hand breadth{H2948}: so he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the breadth{H7341} of the building{H1146}, one{H259} reed{H7070}; and the height{H6967}, one{H259} reed{H7070}."
Ezekiel,40,6,"Then came{H935}{(H8799)} he unto the gate{H8179} which looketh{H6440} toward{H1870} the east{H6921}, and went up{H5927}{(H8799)} the stairs{H4609} thereof, and measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the threshold{H5592} of the gate{H8179}, which was one{H259} reed{H7070} broad{H7341}; and the other{H259} threshold{H5592} of the gate, which was one{H259} reed{H7070} broad{H7341}."
Ezekiel,40,7,"And every little chamber{H8372} was one{H259} reed{H7070} long{H753}, and one{H259} reed{H7070} broad{H7341}; and between the little chambers{H8372} were five{H2568} cubits{H520}; and the threshold{H5592} of the gate{H8179} by{H681} the porch{H197} of the gate{H8179} within{H1004} was one{H259} reed{H7070}."
Ezekiel,40,8,"He measured{H4058}{(H8799)} also the porch{H197} of the gate{H8179} within{H1004}, one{H259} reed{H7070}."
Ezekiel,40,9,"Then measured{H4058}{(H8799)} he the porch{H197} of the gate{H8179}, eight{H8083} cubits{H520}; and the posts{H352} thereof, two{H8147} cubits{H520}; and the porch{H197} of the gate{H8179} was inward{H1004}."
Ezekiel,40,10,"And the little chambers{H8372} of the gate{H8179} eastward{H1870}{H6921} were three{H7969} on this side{H6311}, and three{H7969} on that side{H6311}; they three{H7969} were of one{H259} measure{H4060}: and the posts{H352} had one{H259} measure{H4060} on this side and on that side."
Ezekiel,40,11,"And he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the breadth{H7341} of the entry{H6607} of the gate{H8179}, ten{H6235} cubits{H520}; and the length{H753} of the gate{H8179}, thirteen{H7969}{H6240} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,40,12,"The space{H1366} also before{H6440} the little chambers{H8372} was one{H259} cubit{H520} on this side, and the space{H1366} was one cubit{H520} on that side: and the little chambers{H8372} were six{H8337} cubits{H520} on this side, and six{H8337} cubits{H520} on that side."
Ezekiel,40,13,"He measured{H4058}{(H8799)} then the gate{H8179} from the roof{H1406} of one little chamber{H8372} to the roof{H1406} of another: the breadth{H7341} was five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}, door{H6607} against door{H6607}."
Ezekiel,40,14,"He made{H6213}{(H8799)} also posts{H352} of threescore{H8346} cubits{H520}, even unto the post{H352} of the court{H2691} round about{H5439} the gate{H8179}."
Ezekiel,40,15,And from the face{H6440} of the gate{H8179} of the entrance{H2978} unto the face{H6440} of the porch{H197} of the inner{H6442} gate{H8179} were fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}.
Ezekiel,40,16,"And there were narrow{H331}{(H8801)} windows{H2474} to the little chambers{H8372}, and to their posts{H352} within{H6441} the gate{H8179} round about{H5439}, and likewise to the arches{H361}: and windows{H2474} were round about{H5439} inward{H6441}: and upon each post{H352} were palm trees{H8561}."
Ezekiel,40,17,"Then brought{H935}{(H8686)} he me into the outward{H2435} court{H2691}, and, lo, there were chambers{H3957}, and a pavement{H7531} made{H6213}{(H8803)} for the court{H2691} round about{H5439}: thirty{H7970} chambers{H3957} were upon the pavement{H7531}."
Ezekiel,40,18,And the pavement{H7531} by the side{H3802} of the gates{H8179} over against{H5980} the length{H753} of the gates{H8179} was the lower{H8481} pavement{H7531}.
Ezekiel,40,19,"Then he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the breadth{H7341} from the forefront{H6440} of the lower{H8481} gate{H8179} unto the forefront{H6440} of the inner{H6442} court{H2691} without{H2351}, an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520} eastward{H6921} and northward{H6828}."
Ezekiel,40,20,"And the gate{H8179} of the outward{H2435} court{H2691} that looked{H6440} toward{H1870} the north{H6828}, he measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the length{H753} thereof, and the breadth{H7341} thereof."
Ezekiel,40,21,"And the little chambers{H8372} thereof were three{H7969} on this side and three{H7969} on that side; and the posts{H352} thereof and the arches{H361} thereof were after the measure{H4060} of the first{H7223} gate{H8179}: the length{H753} thereof was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,40,22,"And their windows{H2474}, and their arches{H361}, and their palm trees{H8561}, were after the measure{H4060} of the gate{H8179} that looketh{H6440} toward{H1870} the east{H6921}; and they went up{H5927}{(H8799)} unto it by seven{H7651} steps{H4609}; and the arches{H361} thereof were before{H6440} them."
Ezekiel,40,23,"And the gate{H8179} of the inner{H6442} court{H2691} was over against the gate{H8179} toward the north{H6828}, and toward the east{H6921}; and he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} from gate{H8179} to gate{H8179} an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,40,24,"After that he brought{H3212}{(H8686)} me toward{H1870} the south{H1864}, and behold a gate{H8179} toward{H1870} the south{H1864}: and he measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the posts{H352} thereof and the arches{H361} thereof according to these measures{H4060}."
Ezekiel,40,25,"And there were windows{H2474} in it and in the arches{H361} thereof round about{H5439}, like those windows{H2474}: the length{H753} was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,40,26,"And there were seven{H7651} steps{H4609} to go up{H5930} to it, and the arches{H361} thereof were before{H6440} them: and it had palm trees{H8561}, one{H259} on this side, and another{H259} on that side, upon the posts{H352} thereof."
Ezekiel,40,27,And there was a gate{H8179} in the inner{H6442} court{H2691} toward{H1870} the south{H1864}: and he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} from gate{H8179} to gate{H8179} toward{H1870} the south{H1864} an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}.
Ezekiel,40,28,And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me to the inner{H6442} court{H2691} by the south{H1864} gate{H8179}: and he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the south{H1864} gate{H8179} according to these measures{H4060};
Ezekiel,40,29,"And the little chambers{H8372} thereof, and the posts{H352} thereof, and the arches{H361} thereof, according to these measures{H4060}: and there were windows{H2474} in it and in the arches{H361} thereof round about{H5439}: it was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520} long{H753}, and five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}."
Ezekiel,40,30,"And the arches{H361} round about{H5439} were five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} long{H753}, and five{H2568} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}."
Ezekiel,40,31,And the arches{H361} thereof were toward the utter{H2435} court{H2691}; and palm trees{H8561} were upon the posts{H352} thereof: and the going up{H4608} to it had eight{H8083} steps{H4609}.
Ezekiel,40,32,And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me into the inner{H6442} court{H2691} toward{H1870} the east{H6921}: and he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the gate{H8179} according to these measures{H4060}.
Ezekiel,40,33,"And the little chambers{H8372} thereof, and the posts{H352} thereof, and the arches{H361} thereof, were according to these measures{H4060}: and there were windows{H2474} therein and in the arches{H361} thereof round about{H5439}: it was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520} long{H753}, and five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}."
Ezekiel,40,34,"And the arches{H361} thereof were toward the outward{H2435} court{H2691}; and palm trees{H8561} were upon the posts{H352} thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up{H4608} to it had eight{H8083} steps{H4609}."
Ezekiel,40,35,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me to the north{H6828} gate{H8179}, and measured{H4058}{(H8804)} it according to these measures{H4060};"
Ezekiel,40,36,"The little chambers{H8372} thereof, the posts{H352} thereof, and the arches{H361} thereof, and the windows{H2474} to it round about{H5439}: the length{H753} was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,40,37,"And the posts{H352} thereof were toward the utter{H2435} court{H2691}; and palm trees{H8561} were upon the posts{H352} thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up{H4608} to it had eight{H8083} steps{H4609}."
Ezekiel,40,38,"And the chambers{H3957} and the entries{H6607} thereof were by the posts{H352} of the gates{H8179}, where they washed{H1740}{(H8686)} the burnt offering{H5930}."
Ezekiel,40,39,"And in the porch{H197} of the gate{H8179} were two{H8147} tables{H7979} on this side, and two tables{H7979} on that side, to slay{H7819}{(H8800)} thereon the burnt offering{H5930} and the sin offering{H2403} and the trespass offering{H817}."
Ezekiel,40,40,"And at the side{H3802} without{H2351}, as one goeth up{H5927}{(H8802)} to the entry{H6607} of the north{H6828} gate{H8179}, were two{H8147} tables{H7979}; and on the other{H312} side{H3802}, which was at the porch{H197} of the gate{H8179}, were two{H8147} tables{H7979}."
Ezekiel,40,41,"Four{H702} tables{H7979} were on this side, and four{H702} tables{H7979} on that side, by the side{H3802} of the gate{H8179}; eight{H8083} tables{H7979}, whereupon they slew{H7819}{(H8799)} their sacrifices."
Ezekiel,40,42,"And the four{H702} tables{H7979} were of hewn{H1496} stone{H68} for the burnt offering{H5930}, of a cubit{H520} and an half{H2677} long{H753}, and a cubit{H520} and an half{H2677} broad{H7341}, and one{H259} cubit{H520} high{H1363}: whereupon also they laid{H3240}{(H8686)} the instruments{H3627} wherewith they slew{H7819}{(H8799)} the burnt offering{H5930} and the sacrifice{H2077}."
Ezekiel,40,43,"And within{H1004} were hooks{H8240}, an{H259} hand{H2948} broad, fastened{H3559}{(H8716)} round about{H5439}: and upon the tables{H7979} was the flesh{H1320} of the offering{H7133}."
Ezekiel,40,44,"And without{H2351} the inner{H6442} gate{H8179} were the chambers{H3957} of the singers{H7891}{(H8802)} in the inner{H6442} court{H2691}, which was at the side{H3802} of the north{H6828} gate{H8179}; and their prospect{H6440} was toward{H1870} the south{H1864}: one{H259} at the side{H3802} of the east{H6921} gate{H8179} having the prospect{H6440} toward{H1870} the north{H6828}."
Ezekiel,40,45,"And he said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto me, This{H2090} chamber{H3957}, whose prospect{H6440} is toward{H1870} the south{H1864}, is for the priests{H3548}, the keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the charge{H4931} of the house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,40,46,"And the chamber{H3957} whose prospect{H6440} is toward{H1870} the north{H6828} is for the priests{H3548}, the keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of the charge{H4931} of the altar{H4196}: these are the sons{H1121} of Zadok{H6659} among the sons{H1121} of Levi{H3878}, which come near{H7131} to the LORD{H3068} to minister{H8334}{(H8763)} unto him."
Ezekiel,40,47,"So he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the court{H2691}, an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520} long{H753}, and an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}, foursquare{H7251}{(H8794)}; and the altar{H4196} that was before{H6440} the house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,40,48,"And he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me to the porch{H197} of the house{H1004}, and measured{H4058}{(H8799)} each post{H352} of the porch{H197}, five{H2568} cubits{H520} on this side, and five{H2568} cubits{H520} on that side: and the breadth{H7341} of the gate{H8179} was three{H7969} cubits{H520} on this side, and three{H7969} cubits{H520} on that side."
Ezekiel,40,49,"The length{H753} of the porch{H197} was twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} eleven{H6249}{H6240} cubits{H520}; and he brought me by the steps{H4609} whereby they went up{H5927}{(H8799)} to it: and there were pillars{H5982} by the posts{H352}, one{H259} on this side, and another{H259} on that side."
Ezekiel,41,1,"Afterward he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me to the temple{H1964}, and measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the posts{H352}, six{H8337} cubits{H520} broad{H7341} on the one side{H6311}, and six{H8337} cubits{H520} broad{H7341} on the other side{H6311}, which was the breadth{H7341} of the tabernacle{H168}."
Ezekiel,41,2,"And the breadth{H7341} of the door{H6607} was ten{H6235} cubits{H520}; and the sides{H3802} of the door{H6607} were five{H2568} cubits{H520} on the one side, and five{H2568} cubits{H520} on the other side: and he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the length{H753} thereof, forty{H705} cubits{H520}: and the breadth{H7341}, twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then went{H935}{(H8804)} he inward{H6441}, and measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the post{H352} of the door{H6607}, two{H8147} cubits{H520}; and the door{H6607}, six{H8337} cubits{H520}; and the breadth{H7341} of the door{H6607}, seven{H7651} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,41,4,"So he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the length{H753} thereof, twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}; and the breadth{H7341}, twenty{H6242} cubits{H520}, before{H6440} the temple{H1964}: and he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, This is the most{H6944} holy{H6944} place."
Ezekiel,41,5,"After he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} the wall{H7023} of the house{H1004}, six{H8337} cubits{H520}; and the breadth{H7341} of every side chamber{H6763}, four{H702} cubits{H520}, round about{H5439} the house{H1004} on every side{H5439}."
Ezekiel,41,6,"And the side{H6763} chambers{H6763} were three{H7969}, one over another{H6763}, and thirty{H7970} in order{H6471}; and they entered{H935}{(H8802)} into the wall{H7023} which was of the house{H1004} for the side chambers{H6763} round about{H5439}, that they might have hold{H270}{(H8803)}, but they had not hold{H270}{(H8803)} in the wall{H7023} of the house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,41,7,"And there was an enlarging{H7337}{(H8804)}, and a winding about{H5437}{(H8738)} still upward{H4605} to the side chambers{H6763}: for the winding about{H4141} of the house{H1004} went still upward{H4605} round about{H5439} the house{H1004}: therefore the breadth{H7341} of the house{H1004} was still upward{H4605}, and so increased{H5927}{(H8799)} from the lowest{H8481} chamber to the highest{H5945} by the midst{H8484}."
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} also the height{H1363} of the house{H1004} round about{H5439}: the foundations{H4328} of the side chambers{H6763} were a full{H4393} reed{H7070} of six{H8337} great{H679} cubits{H520}.
Ezekiel,41,9,"The thickness{H7341} of the wall{H7023}, which was for the side chamber{H6763} without{H2351}, was five{H2568} cubits{H520}: and that which was left{H3240}{(H8716)} was the place{H1004} of the side chambers{H6763} that were within{H1004}."
Ezekiel,41,10,And between the chambers{H3957} was the wideness{H7341} of twenty{H6242} cubits{H520} round about{H5439} the house{H1004} on every side{H5439}.
Ezekiel,41,11,"And the doors{H6607} of the side chambers{H6763} were toward the place that was left{H3240}{(H8716)}, one{H259} door{H6607} toward{H1870} the north{H6828}, and another{H259} door{H6607} toward the south{H1864}: and the breadth{H7341} of the place{H4725} that was left{H3240}{(H8716)} was five{H2568} cubits{H520} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,41,12,"Now the building{H1146} that was before{H6440} the separate place{H1508} at the end{H6285} toward{H1870} the west{H3220} was seventy{H7657} cubits{H520} broad{H7341}; and the wall{H7023} of the building{H1146} was five{H2568} cubits{H520} thick{H7341} round about{H5439}, and the length{H753} thereof ninety{H8673} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,41,13,"So he measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the house{H1004}, an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520} long{H753}; and the separate place{H1508}, and the building{H1140}, with the walls{H7023} thereof, an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520} long{H753};"
Ezekiel,41,14,"Also the breadth{H7341} of the face{H6440} of the house{H1004}, and of the separate place{H1508} toward the east{H6921}, an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,41,15,"And he measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the length{H753} of the building{H1146} over against{H6440} the separate place{H1508} which was behind{H310} it, and the galleries{H862} thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}, with the inner{H6442} temple{H1964}, and the porches{H197} of the court{H2691};"
Ezekiel,41,16,"The door posts{H5592}, and the narrow{H331}{(H8801)} windows{H2474}, and the galleries{H862} round about{H5439} on their three stories{H7969}, over against{H5048} the door{H5592}, cieled{H7824} with wood{H6086} round about{H5439}, and from the ground{H776} up to the windows{H2474}, and the windows{H2474} were covered{H3680}{(H8794)};"
Ezekiel,41,17,"To that above the door{H6607}, even unto the inner{H6442} house{H1004}, and without{H2351}, and by all the wall{H7023} round about{H5439} within{H6442} and without{H2435}, by measure{H4060}."
Ezekiel,41,18,"And it was made{H6213}{(H8803)} with cherubims{H3742} and palm trees{H8561}, so that a palm tree{H8561} was between a cherub{H3742} and a cherub{H3742}; and every cherub{H3742} had two{H8147} faces{H6440};"
Ezekiel,41,19,"So that the face{H6440} of a man{H120} was toward the palm tree{H8561} on the one side, and the face{H6440} of a young lion{H3715} toward the palm tree{H8561} on the other side: it was made{H6213}{(H8803)} through all the house{H1004} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,41,20,"From the ground{H776} unto above the door{H6607} were cherubims{H3742} and palm trees{H8561} made{H6213}{(H8803)}, and on the wall{H7023} of the temple{H1964}."
Ezekiel,41,21,"The posts{H4201} of the temple{H1964} were squared{H7251}{(H8803)}, and the face{H6440} of the sanctuary{H6944}; the appearance{H4758} of the one as the appearance{H4758} of the other."
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar{H4196} of wood{H6086} was three{H7969} cubits{H520} high{H1364}, and the length{H753} thereof two{H8147} cubits{H520}; and the corners{H4740} thereof, and the length{H753} thereof, and the walls{H7023} thereof, were of wood{H6086}: and he said{H1696}{(H8762)} unto me, This is the table{H7979} that is before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,41,23,And the temple{H1964} and the sanctuary{H6944} had two{H8147} doors{H1817}.
Ezekiel,41,24,"And the doors{H1817} had two{H8147} leaves{H1817} apiece, two{H8147} turning{H4142}{(H8716)} leaves{H1817}; two{H8147} leaves for the one{H259} door{H1817}, and two{H8147} leaves{H1817} for the other{H312} door."
Ezekiel,41,25,"And there were made{H6213}{(H8803)} on them, on the doors{H1817} of the temple{H1964}, cherubims{H3742} and palm trees{H8561}, like as were made{H6213}{(H8803)} upon the walls{H7023}; and there were thick{H5646} planks{H6086} upon the face{H6440} of the porch{H197} without{H2351}."
Ezekiel,41,26,"And there were narrow{H331}{(H8801)} windows{H2474} and palm trees{H8561} on the one side and on the other side, on the sides{H3802} of the porch{H197}, and upon the side chambers{H6763} of the house{H1004}, and thick planks{H5646}."
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then he brought me forth{H3318}{(H8686)} into the utter{H2435} court{H2691}, the way toward{H1870} the north{H6828}: and he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me into the chamber{H3957} that was over against the separate place{H1508}, and which was before the building{H1146} toward the north{H6828}."
Ezekiel,42,2,"Before{H6440} the length{H753} of an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520} was the north{H6828} door{H6607}, and the breadth{H7341} was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Over against the twenty{H6242} cubits which were for the inner{H6442} court{H2691}, and over against the pavement{H7531} which was for the utter{H2435} court{H2691}, was gallery{H862} against{H6440} gallery{H862} in three{H7992} stories."
Ezekiel,42,4,"And before{H6440} the chambers{H3957} was a walk{H4109} of ten{H6235} cubits{H520} breadth{H7341} inward{H6442}, a way{H1870} of one{H259} cubit{H520}; and their doors{H6607} toward the north{H6828}."
Ezekiel,42,5,"Now the upper{H5945} chambers{H3957} were shorter{H7114}{(H8803)}: for the galleries{H862} were higher{H398}{(H8799)} than these{H2007}, than the lower{H8481}, and than the middlemost{H8484} of the building{H1146}."
Ezekiel,42,6,"For they were in three{H8027}{(H8794)} stories, but had not pillars{H5982} as the pillars{H5982} of the courts{H2691}: therefore the building was straitened{H680}{(H8738)} more than the lowest{H8481} and the middlemost{H8484} from the ground{H776}."
Ezekiel,42,7,"And the wall{H1447} that was without{H2351} over against{H5980} the chambers{H3957}, toward{H1870} the utter{H2435} court{H2691} on the forepart{H6440} of the chambers{H3957}, the length{H753} thereof was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the length{H753} of the chambers{H3957} that were in the utter{H2435} court{H2691} was fifty{H2572} cubits{H520}: and, lo, before{H6440} the temple{H1964} were an hundred{H3967} cubits{H520}."
Ezekiel,42,9,"And from under these chambers{H3957} was the entry{H3996}{(H8675)}{H935}{(H8688)} on the east side{H6921}, as one goeth{H935}{(H8800)} into them{H2007} from the utter{H2435} court{H2691}."
Ezekiel,42,10,"The chambers{H3957} were in the thickness{H7341} of the wall{H1444} of the court{H2691} toward{H1870} the east{H6921}, over against{H6440} the separate place{H1508}, and over against{H6440} the building{H1146}."
Ezekiel,42,11,"And the way{H1870} before{H6440} them was like the appearance{H4758} of the chambers{H3957} which were toward{H1870} the north{H6828}, as long as{H753} they, and as broad as{H3651}{H7341} they: and all their goings out{H4161} were both according to their fashions{H4941}, and according to their doors{H6607}."
Ezekiel,42,12,"And according to the doors{H6607} of the chambers{H3957} that were toward{H1870} the south{H1864} was a door{H6607} in the head{H7218} of the way{H1870}, even the way{H1870} directly{H1903} before{H6440} the wall{H1448} toward{H1870} the east{H6921}, as one entereth{H935}{(H8800)} into them."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, The north{H6828} chambers{H3957} and the south{H1864} chambers{H3957}, which are before{H6440} the separate place{H1508}, they be holy{H6944} chambers{H3957}, where the priests{H3548} that approach{H7138} unto the LORD{H3068} shall eat{H398}{(H8799)} the most{H6944} holy things{H6944}: there shall they lay{H3240}{(H8686)} the most{H6944} holy things{H6944}, and the meat offering{H4503}, and the sin offering{H2403}, and the trespass offering{H817}; for the place{H4725} is holy{H6918}."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests{H3548} enter{H935}{(H8800)} therein, then shall they not go out{H3318}{(H8799)} of the holy{H6944} place into the utter{H2435} court{H2691}, but there they shall lay{H3240}{(H8686)} their garments{H899} wherein they minister{H8334}{(H8762)}; for they are holy{H6944}; and shall put{H3847}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H3847}{(H8799)} on other{H312} garments{H899}, and shall approach{H7126}{(H8804)} to those things which are for the people{H5971}."
Ezekiel,42,15,"Now when he had made an end{H3615}{(H8765)} of measuring{H4060} the inner{H6442} house{H1004}, he brought me forth{H3318}{(H8689)} toward{H1870} the gate{H8179} whose prospect{H6440} is toward{H1870} the east{H6921}, and measured{H4058}{(H8804)} it round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,42,16,"He measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the east{H6921} side{H7307} with the measuring{H4060} reed{H7070}, five{H2568}{(H8675)}{H520} hundred{H3967} reeds{H7070}, with the measuring{H4060} reed{H7070} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,42,17,"He measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the north{H6828} side{H7307}, five{H2568} hundred{H3967} reeds{H7070}, with the measuring{H4060} reed{H7070} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,42,18,"He measured{H4058}{(H8804)} the south{H1864} side{H7307}, five{H2568} hundred{H3967} reeds{H7070}, with the measuring{H4060} reed{H7070}."
Ezekiel,42,19,"He turned about{H5437}{(H8804)} to the west{H3220} side{H7307}, and measured{H4058}{(H8804)} five{H2568} hundred{H3967} reeds{H7070} with the measuring{H4060} reed{H7070}."
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured{H4058}{(H8804)} it by the four{H702} sides{H7307}: it had a wall{H2346} round about{H5439}, five{H2568} hundred{H3967} reeds long{H753}, and five{H2568} hundred{H3967} broad{H7341}, to make a separation{H914}{(H8687)} between the sanctuary{H6944} and the profane place{H2455}."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Afterward he brought{H3212}{(H8686)} me to the gate{H8179}, even the gate{H8179} that looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} toward{H1870} the east{H6921}:"
Ezekiel,43,2,"And, behold, the glory{H3519} of the God{H430} of Israel{H3478} came{H935}{(H8804)} from the way{H1870} of the east{H6921}: and his voice{H6963} was like a noise{H6963} of many{H7227} waters{H4325}: and the earth{H776} shined{H215}{(H8689)} with his glory{H3519}."
Ezekiel,43,3,"And it was according to the appearance{H4758} of the vision{H4758} which I saw{H7200}{(H8804)}, even according to the vision{H4758} that I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} when I came{H935}{(H8800)} to destroy{H7843}{(H8763)} the city{H5892}: and the visions{H4759} were like the vision{H4758} that I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} by the river{H5104} Chebar{H3529}; and I fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon my face{H6440}."
Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} came{H935}{(H8804)} into the house{H1004} by the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} whose prospect{H6440} is toward{H1870} the east{H6921}.
Ezekiel,43,5,"So the spirit{H7307} took me up{H5375}{(H8799)}, and brought{H935}{(H8686)} me into the inner{H6442} court{H2691}; and, behold, the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,43,6,And I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} him speaking{H1696}{(H8693)} unto me out of the house{H1004}; and the man{H376} stood{H5975}{(H8802)} by me{H681}.
Ezekiel,43,7,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, the place{H4725} of my throne{H3678}, and the place{H4725} of the soles{H3709} of my feet{H7272}, where I will dwell{H7931}{(H8799)} in the midst{H8432} of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478} for ever{H5769}, and my holy{H6944} name{H8034}, shall the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478} no more defile{H2930}{(H8762)}, neither they, nor their kings{H4428}, by their whoredom{H2184}, nor by the carcases{H6297} of their kings{H4428} in their high places{H1116}."
Ezekiel,43,8,"In their setting{H5414}{(H8800)} of their threshold{H5592} by my thresholds{H5592}, and their post{H4201} by{H681} my posts{H4201}, and the wall{H7023} between me and them, they have even defiled{H2930}{(H8765)} my holy{H6944} name{H8034} by their abominations{H8441} that they have committed{H6213}{(H8804)}: wherefore I have consumed{H3615}{(H8762)} them in mine anger{H639}."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them put away{H7368} their whoredom{H2184}, and the carcases{H6297} of their kings{H4428}, far{H7368}{(H8762)} from me, and I will dwell{H7931}{(H8804)} in the midst{H8432} of them for ever{H5769}."
Ezekiel,43,10,"Thou son{H1121} of man{H120}, shew{H5046}{(H8685)} the house{H1004} to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, that they may be ashamed{H3637}{(H8735)} of their iniquities{H5771}: and let them measure{H4058}{(H8804)} the pattern{H8508}."
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they be ashamed{H3637}{(H8738)} of all that they have done{H6213}{(H8804)}, shew{H3045}{(H8685)} them the form{H6699} of the house{H1004}, and the fashion{H8498} thereof, and the goings out{H4161} thereof, and the comings{H4126} in thereof, and all the forms{H6699} thereof, and all the ordinances{H2708} thereof, and all the forms{H6699} thereof, and all the laws{H8451} thereof: and write{H3789}{(H8798)} it in their sight{H5869}, that they may keep{H8104}{(H8799)} the whole form{H6699} thereof, and all the ordinances{H2708} thereof, and do{H6213}{(H8804)} them."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the law{H8451} of the house{H1004}; Upon the top{H7218} of the mountain{H2022} the whole limit{H1366} thereof round about{H5439} shall be most{H6944} holy{H6944}. Behold, this is the law{H8451} of the house{H1004}."
Ezekiel,43,13,"And these are the measures{H4060} of the altar{H4196} after the cubits{H520}: The cubit{H520} is a cubit{H520} and an hand breadth{H2948}; even the bottom{H2436} shall be a cubit{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} a cubit{H520}, and the border{H1366} thereof by the edge{H8193} thereof round about{H5439} shall be a{H259} span{H2239}: and this shall be the higher place{H1354} of the altar{H4196}."
Ezekiel,43,14,"And from the bottom{H2436} upon the ground{H776} even to the lower{H8481} settle{H5835} shall be two{H8147} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} one{H259} cubit{H520}; and from the lesser{H6996} settle{H5835} even to the greater{H1419} settle{H5835} shall be four{H702} cubits{H520}, and the breadth{H7341} one cubit{H520}."
Ezekiel,43,15,So the altar{H741}{H2025} shall be four{H702} cubits{H520}; and from the altar{H741} and upward{H4605} shall be four{H702} horns{H7161}.
Ezekiel,43,16,"And the altar{H741} shall be twelve{H8147}{H6240} cubits long{H753}, twelve{H8147}{H6240} broad{H7341}, square{H7251}{(H8803)} in the four{H702} squares{H7253} thereof."
Ezekiel,43,17,And the settle{H5835} shall be fourteen{H702}{H6240} cubits long{H753} and fourteen{H702}{H6240} broad{H7341} in the four{H702} squares{H7253} thereof; and the border{H1366} about{H5439} it shall be half{H2677} a cubit{H520}; and the bottom{H2436} thereof shall be a cubit{H520} about{H5439}; and his stairs{H4609} shall look{H6437}{(H8800)} toward the east{H6921}.
Ezekiel,43,18,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; These are the ordinances{H2708} of the altar{H4196} in the day{H3117} when they shall make{H6213}{(H8736)} it, to offer{H5927}{(H8687)} burnt offerings{H5930} thereon, and to sprinkle{H2236}{(H8800)} blood{H1818} thereon."
Ezekiel,43,19,"And thou shalt give{H5414}{(H8804)} to the priests{H3548} the Levites{H3881} that be of the seed{H2233} of Zadok{H6659}, which approach{H7138} unto me, to minister{H8334}{(H8763)} unto me, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}, a young{H1121}{H1241} bullock{H6499} for a sin offering{H2403}."
Ezekiel,43,20,"And thou shalt take{H3947}{(H8804)} of the blood{H1818} thereof, and put{H5414}{(H8804)} it on the four{H702} horns{H7161} of it, and on the four{H702} corners{H6438} of the settle{H5835}, and upon the border{H1366} round about{H5439}: thus shalt thou cleanse{H2398}{(H8765)} and purge{H3722}{(H8765)} it."
Ezekiel,43,21,"Thou shalt take{H3947}{(H8804)} the bullock{H6499} also of the sin offering{H2403}, and he shall burn{H8313}{(H8804)} it in the appointed place{H4662} of the house{H1004}, without{H2351} the sanctuary{H4720}."
Ezekiel,43,22,"And on the second{H8145} day{H3117} thou shalt offer{H7126}{(H8686)} a kid{H8163} of the goats{H5795} without blemish{H8549} for a sin offering{H2403}; and they shall cleanse{H2398}{(H8765)} the altar{H4196}, as they did cleanse{H2398}{(H8765)} it with the bullock{H6499}."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When thou hast made an end{H3615}{(H8763)} of cleansing{H2398}{(H8763)} it, thou shalt offer{H7126}{(H8686)} a young{H1121}{H1241} bullock{H6499} without blemish{H8549}, and a ram{H352} out of the flock{H6629} without blemish{H8549}."
Ezekiel,43,24,"And thou shalt offer{H7126}{(H8689)} them before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}, and the priests{H3548} shall cast{H7993}{(H8689)} salt{H4417} upon them, and they shall offer them up{H5927}{(H8689)} for a burnt offering{H5930} unto the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,43,25,"Seven{H7651} days{H3117} shalt thou prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} every day{H3117} a goat{H8163} for a sin offering{H2403}: they shall also prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} a young{H1121}{H1241} bullock{H6499}, and a ram{H352} out of the flock{H6629}, without blemish{H8549}."
Ezekiel,43,26,Seven{H7651} days{H3117} shall they purge{H3722}{(H8762)} the altar{H4196} and purify{H2891}{(H8765)} it; and they shall consecrate themselves{H4390}{(H8765)}{H3027}.
Ezekiel,43,27,"And when these days{H3117} are expired{H3615}{(H8762)}, it shall be, that upon the eighth{H8066} day{H3117}, and so forward{H1973}, the priests{H3548} shall make{H6213}{(H8799)} your burnt offerings{H5930} upon the altar{H4196}, and your peace offerings{H8002}; and I will accept{H7521}{(H8804)} you, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,44,1,Then he brought me back{H7725}{(H8686)} the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} of the outward{H2435} sanctuary{H4720} which looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the east{H6921}; and it was shut{H5462}{(H8803)}.
Ezekiel,44,2,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} the LORD{H3068} unto me; This gate{H8179} shall be shut{H5462}{(H8803)}, it shall not be opened{H6605}{(H8735)}, and no man{H376} shall enter{H935}{(H8799)} in by it; because the LORD{H3068}, the God{H430} of Israel{H3478}, hath entered{H935}{(H8804)} in by it, therefore it shall be shut{H5462}{(H8803)}."
Ezekiel,44,3,"It is for the prince{H5387}; the prince{H5387}, he shall sit{H3427}{(H8799)} in it to eat{H398}{(H8800)} bread{H3899} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068}; he shall enter{H935}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the porch{H197} of that gate{H8179}, and shall go out{H3318}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the same."
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then brought{H935}{(H8686)} he me the way{H1870} of the north{H6828} gate{H8179} before{H6440} the house{H1004}: and I looked{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, the glory{H3519} of the LORD{H3068} filled{H4390}{(H8804)} the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}: and I fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon my face{H6440}."
Ezekiel,44,5,"And the LORD{H3068} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, mark{H7760}{(H8798)} well{H3820}, and behold{H7200}{(H8798)} with thine eyes{H5869}, and hear{H8085}{(H8798)} with thine ears{H241} all that I say{H1696}{(H8764)} unto thee concerning all the ordinances{H2708} of the house{H1004} of the LORD{H3068}, and all the laws{H8451} thereof; and mark{H7760}{(H8804)} well{H3820} the entering in{H3996} of the house{H1004}, with every going forth{H4161} of the sanctuary{H4720}."
Ezekiel,44,6,"And thou shalt say{H559}{(H8804)} to the rebellious{H4805}, even to the house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; O ye house{H1004} of Israel{H3478}, let it suffice{H7227} you of all your abominations{H8441},"
Ezekiel,44,7,"In that ye have brought{H935}{(H8687)} into my sanctuary strangers{H1121}{H5236}, uncircumcised{H6189} in heart{H3820}, and uncircumcised{H6189} in flesh{H1320}, to be in my sanctuary{H4720}, to pollute{H2490}{(H8763)} it, even my house{H1004}, when ye offer{H7126}{(H8687)} my bread{H3899}, the fat{H2459} and the blood{H1818}, and they have broken{H6565}{(H8686)} my covenant{H1285} because{H413} of all your abominations{H8441}."
Ezekiel,44,8,And ye have not kept{H8104}{(H8804)} the charge{H4931} of mine holy things{H6944}: but ye have set{H7760}{(H8799)} keepers{H8104}{(H8802)} of my charge{H4931} in my sanctuary{H4720} for yourselves.
Ezekiel,44,9,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; No stranger{H1121}{H5236}, uncircumcised{H6189} in heart{H3820}, nor uncircumcised{H6189} in flesh{H1320}, shall enter{H935}{(H8799)} into my sanctuary{H4720}, of any stranger that is among{H8432} the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}."

Ezekiel,46,9,"But when the people{H5971} of the land{H776} shall come{H935}{(H8800)} before{H6440} the LORD{H3068} in the solemn feasts{H4150}, he that entereth{H935}{(H8802)} in by the way{H1870} of the north{H6828} gate{H8179} to worship{H7812}{(H8692)} shall go out{H3318}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the south{H5045} gate{H8179}; and he that entereth{H935}{(H8802)} by the way{H1870} of the south{H5045} gate{H8179} shall go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the north{H6828} gate{H8179}: he shall not return{H7725}{(H8799)} by the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} whereby he came in{H935}{(H8804)}, but shall go forth{H3318}{(H8799)} over against{H5226} it."
Ezekiel,46,10,"And the prince{H5387} in the midst{H8432} of them, when they go in{H935}{(H8800)}, shall go in{H935}{(H8799)}; and when they go forth{H3318}{(H8800)}, shall go forth{H3318}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,46,11,"And in the feasts{H2282} and in the solemnities{H4150} the meat offering{H4503} shall be an ephah{H374} to a bullock{H6499}, and an ephah{H374} to a ram{H352}, and to the lambs{H3532} as he is able{H3027} to give{H4991}, and an hin{H1969} of oil{H8081} to an ephah{H374}."
Ezekiel,46,12,"Now when the prince{H5387} shall prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} a voluntary{H5071} burnt offering{H5930} or peace offerings{H8002} voluntarily{H5071} unto the LORD{H3068}, one shall then open{H6605}{(H8804)} him the gate{H8179} that looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the east{H6921}, and he shall prepare{H6213}{(H8804)} his burnt offering{H5930} and his peace offerings{H8002}, as he did{H6213}{(H8799)} on the sabbath{H7676} day{H3117}: then he shall go forth{H3318}{(H8804)}; and after{H310} his going forth{H3318}{(H8800)} one shall shut{H5462}{(H8804)} the gate{H8179}."
Ezekiel,46,13,Thou shalt daily{H3117} prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} a burnt offering{H5930} unto the LORD{H3068} of a lamb{H3532} of the first{H1121} year{H8141} without blemish{H8549}: thou shalt prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} it every{H1242} morning{H1242}.
Ezekiel,46,14,"And thou shalt prepare{H6213}{(H8799)} a meat offering{H4503} for it every morning{H1242}, the sixth part{H8345} of an ephah{H374}, and the third part{H7992} of an hin{H1969} of oil{H8081}, to temper with{H7450}{(H8800)} the fine flour{H5560}; a meat offering{H4503} continually{H8548} by a perpetual{H5769} ordinance{H2708} unto the LORD{H3068}."
Ezekiel,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare{H6213}{(H8799)}{(H8675)}{H6213}{(H8804)} the lamb{H3532}, and the meat offering{H4503}, and the oil{H8081}, every morning{H1242} for a continual{H8548} burnt offering{H5930}."
Ezekiel,46,16,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; If the prince{H5387} give{H5414}{(H8799)} a gift{H4979} unto any{H376} of his sons{H1121}, the inheritance{H5159} thereof shall be his sons{H1121}'; it shall be their possession{H272} by inheritance{H5159}."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he give{H5414}{(H8799)} a gift{H4979} of his inheritance{H5159} to one{H259} of his servants{H5650}, then it shall be his to the year{H8141} of liberty{H1865}; after it shall return{H7725}{(H8804)} to the prince{H5387}: but his inheritance{H5159} shall be his sons{H1121}' for them."
Ezekiel,46,18,"Moreover the prince{H5387} shall not take{H3947}{(H8799)} of the people's{H5971} inheritance{H5159} by oppression{H3238}{(H8687)}, to thrust{H3238}{(H8687)} them out of their possession{H272}; but he shall give his sons{H1121} inheritance{H5157}{(H8686)} out of his own possession{H272}: that my people{H5971} be not scattered{H6327}{(H8799)} every man{H376} from his possession{H272}."
Ezekiel,46,19,"After he brought{H935}{(H8686)} me through the entry{H3996}, which was at the side{H3802} of the gate{H8179}, into the holy{H6944} chambers{H3957} of the priests{H3548}, which looked{H6437}{(H8802)} toward the north{H6828}: and, behold, there was a place{H4725} on the two sides{H3411} westward{H3220}."
Ezekiel,46,20,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, This is the place{H4725} where the priests{H3548} shall boil{H1310}{(H8762)} the trespass offering{H817} and the sin offering{H2403}, where they shall bake{H644}{(H8799)} the meat offering{H4503}; that they bear{H3318}{(H8687)} them not out into the utter{H2435} court{H2691}, to sanctify{H6942}{(H8763)} the people{H5971}."
Ezekiel,46,21,"Then he brought me forth{H3318}{(H8686)} into the utter{H2435} court{H2691}, and caused me to pass by{H5674}{(H8686)} the four{H702} corners{H4740} of the court{H2691}; and, behold, in every{H4740} corner{H4740} of the court{H2691}{H2691} there was a court{H2691}."
Ezekiel,46,22,In the four{H702} corners{H4740} of the court{H2691} there were courts{H2691} joined{H7000}{(H8803)} of forty{H705} cubits long{H753} and thirty{H7970} broad{H7341}: these four{H702} corners{H7106}{(H8716)} were of one{H259} measure{H4060}.
Ezekiel,46,23,"And there was a row{H2905} of building round about{H5439} in them, round about{H5439} them four{H702}, and it was made{H6213}{(H8803)} with boiling places{H4018} under the rows{H2918} round about{H5439}."
Ezekiel,46,24,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, These are the places{H1004} of them that boil{H1310}{(H8764)}, where the ministers{H8334}{(H8764)} of the house{H1004} shall boil{H1310}{(H8762)} the sacrifice{H2077} of the people{H5971}."
Ezekiel,47,1,"Afterward he brought me again{H7725}{(H8686)} unto the door{H6607} of the house{H1004}; and, behold, waters{H4325} issued out{H3318}{(H8802)} from under the threshold{H4670} of the house{H1004} eastward{H6921}: for the forefront{H6440} of the house{H1004} stood toward the east{H6921}, and the waters{H4325} came down{H3381}{(H8802)} from under from the right{H3233} side{H3802} of the house{H1004}, at the south{H5045} side of the altar{H4196}."
Ezekiel,47,2,"Then brought he me out{H3318}{(H8686)} of the way{H1870} of the gate{H8179} northward{H6828}, and led me about{H5437}{(H8686)} the way{H1870} without unto the utter{H2351} gate{H8179} by the way{H1870} that looketh{H6437}{(H8802)} eastward{H6921}; and, behold, there ran out{H6379}{(H8764)} waters{H4325} on the right{H3233} side{H3802}."
Ezekiel,47,3,"And when the man{H376} that had the line{H6957} in his hand{H3027} went forth{H3318}{(H8800)} eastward{H6921}, he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} a thousand{H505} cubits{H520}, and he brought me through{H5674}{(H8686)} the waters{H4325}; the waters{H4325} were to the ankles{H657}."
Ezekiel,47,4,"Again he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} a thousand{H505}, and brought me through{H5674}{(H8686)} the waters{H4325}; the waters{H4325} were to the knees{H1290}. Again he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} a thousand{H505}, and brought me through{H5674}{(H8686)}; the waters{H4325} were to the loins{H4975}."
Ezekiel,47,5,"Afterward he measured{H4058}{(H8799)} a thousand{H505}; and it was a river{H5158} that I could{H3201}{(H8799)} not pass over{H5674}{(H8800)}: for the waters{H4325} were risen{H1342}{(H8804)}, waters{H4325} to swim in{H7813}, a river{H5158} that could not be passed over{H5674}{(H8735)}."
Ezekiel,47,6,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Son{H1121} of man{H120}, hast thou seen{H7200}{(H8804)} this? Then he brought{H3212}{(H8686)} me, and caused me to return{H7725}{(H8686)} to the brink{H8193} of the river{H5158}."
Ezekiel,47,7,"Now when I had returned{H7725}{(H8800)}, behold, at the bank{H8193} of the river{H5158} were very{H3966} many{H7227} trees{H6086} on the one side and on the other."
Ezekiel,47,8,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} he unto me, These waters{H4325} issue out{H3318}{(H8802)} toward the east{H6930} country{H1552}, and go down{H3381}{(H8804)} into the desert{H6160}, and go{H935}{(H8804)} into the sea{H3220}: which being brought forth{H3318}{(H8716)} into the sea{H3220}, the waters{H4325} shall be healed{H7495}{(H8738)}."
Ezekiel,47,9,"And it shall come to pass, that every thing{H5315} that liveth{H2416}, which moveth{H8317}{(H8799)}, whithersoever the rivers{H5158} shall come{H935}{(H8799)}, shall live{H2421}{(H8799)}: and there shall be a very{H3966} great{H7227} multitude of fish{H1710}, because these waters{H4325} shall come{H935}{(H8804)} thither: for they shall be healed{H7495}{(H8735)}; and every thing shall live{H2425}{(H8804)} whither the river{H5158} cometh{H935}{(H8799)}."
Ezekiel,47,10,"And it shall come to pass, that the fishers{H1728} shall stand{H5975}{(H8804)}{(H8675)}{H5975}{(H8799)} upon it from Engedi{H5872} even unto Eneglaim{H5882}; they shall be a place to spread forth{H4894} nets{H2764}; their fish{H1710} shall be according to their kinds{H4327}, as the fish{H1710} of the great{H1419} sea{H3220}, exceeding{H3966} many{H7227}."
Ezekiel,47,11,But the miry places{H1207} thereof and the marishes{H1360} thereof shall not be healed{H7495}{(H8735)}; they shall be given{H5414}{(H8738)} to salt{H4417}.
Ezekiel,47,12,"And by the river{H5158} upon the bank{H8193} thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow{H5927}{(H8799)} all trees{H6086} for meat{H3978}, whose leaf{H5929} shall not fade{H5034}{(H8799)}, neither shall the fruit{H6529} thereof be consumed{H8552}{(H8799)}: it shall bring forth new fruit{H1069}{(H8762)} according to his months{H2320}, because their waters{H4325} they issued out{H3318}{(H8802)} of the sanctuary{H4720}: and the fruit{H6529} thereof shall be for meat{H3978}, and the leaf{H5929} thereof for medicine{H8644}."
Ezekiel,47,13,"Thus saith{H559}{(H8804)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}; This{H1454} shall be the border{H1366}, whereby ye shall inherit{H5157}{(H8691)} the land{H776} according to the twelve{H8147}{H6240} tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}: Joseph{H3130} shall have two portions{H2256}."
Ezekiel,47,14,"And ye shall inherit{H5157}{(H8804)} it, one{H376} as well as another{H251}: concerning the which I lifted up{H5375}{(H8804)} mine hand{H3027} to give{H5414}{(H8800)} it unto your fathers{H1}: and this land{H776} shall fall{H5307}{(H8804)} unto you for inheritance{H5159}."
Ezekiel,47,15,"And this shall be the border{H1366} of the land{H776} toward the north{H6828} side{H6285}, from the great{H1419} sea{H3220}, the way{H1870} of Hethlon{H2855}, as men go{H935}{(H8800)} to Zedad{H6657};"
Ezekiel,47,16,"Hamath{H2574}, Berothah{H1268}, Sibraim{H5453}, which is between the border{H1366} of Damascus{H1834} and the border{H1366} of Hamath{H2574}; Hazarhatticon{H2694}, which is by the coast{H1366} of Hauran{H2362}."
Ezekiel,47,17,"And the border{H1366} from the sea{H3220} shall be Hazarenan{H2703}, the border{H1366} of Damascus{H1834}, and the north{H6828} northward{H6828}, and the border{H1366} of Hamath{H2574}. And this is the north{H6828} side{H6285}."
Ezekiel,47,18,"And the east{H6921} side{H6285} ye shall measure{H4058}{(H8799)} from{H996} Hauran{H2362}, and from{H996} Damascus{H1834}, and from{H996} Gilead{H1568}, and from{H996} the land{H776} of Israel{H3478} by Jordan{H3383}, from the border{H1366} unto the east{H6931} sea{H3220}. And this is the east{H6921} side{H6285}."
Ezekiel,47,19,"And the south{H5045} side{H6285} southward{H8486}, from Tamar{H8559} even to the waters{H4325} of strife{H4808}{(H8677)}{H4809} in Kadesh{H6946}, the river{H5158} to the great{H1419} sea{H3220}. And this is the south{H8486} side{H6285} southward{H5045}."
Ezekiel,47,20,"The west{H3220} side{H6285} also shall be the great{H1419} sea{H3220} from the border{H1366}, till a man come{H935}{(H8800)} over against{H5227} Hamath{H2574}. This is the west{H3220} side{H6285}."
Ezekiel,47,21,So shall ye divide{H2505}{(H8765)} this land{H776} unto you according to the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}.
Ezekiel,47,22,"And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide{H5307}{(H8686)} it by lot for an inheritance{H5159} unto you, and to the strangers{H1616} that sojourn{H1481}{(H8802)} among{H8432} you, which shall beget{H3205}{(H8689)} children{H1121} among{H8432} you: and they shall be unto you as born{H249} in the country{H249} among the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}; they shall have{H5307}{(H8799)} inheritance{H5159} with you among{H8432} the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}."
Ezekiel,47,23,"And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe{H7626} the stranger{H1616} sojourneth{H1481}{(H8804)}, there shall ye give{H5414}{(H8799)} him his inheritance{H5159}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."

Ezekiel,48,15,"And the five{H2568} thousand{H505}, that are left{H3498}{(H8737)} in the breadth{H7341} over against{H6440} the five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505}, shall be a profane{H2455} place for the city{H5892}, for dwelling{H4186}, and for suburbs{H4054}: and the city{H5892} shall be in the midst{H8432} thereof."
Ezekiel,48,16,"And these shall be the measures{H4060} thereof; the north{H6828} side{H6285} four{H702} thousand{H505} and five{H2568} hundred{H3967}, and the south{H5045} side{H6285} four{H702} thousand{H505} and five{H2568} hundred{H3967}, and on the east{H6921} side{H6285} four{H702} thousand{H505} and five{H2568} hundred{H3967}, and the west{H3220} side{H6285} four{H702} thousand{H505} and five{H2568}{(H8675)}{H2568} hundred{H3967}."
Ezekiel,48,17,"And the suburbs{H4054} of the city{H5892} shall be toward the north{H6828} two hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}, and toward the south{H5045} two hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}, and toward the east{H6921} two hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}, and toward the west{H3220} two hundred{H3967} and fifty{H2572}."
Ezekiel,48,18,"And the residue{H3498}{(H8737)} in length{H753} over against{H5980} the oblation{H8641} of the holy{H6944} portion shall be ten{H6235} thousand{H505} eastward{H6921}, and ten{H6235} thousand{H505} westward{H3220}: and it shall be over against{H5980} the oblation{H8641} of the holy{H6944} portion; and the increase{H8393} thereof shall be for food{H3899} unto them that serve{H5647}{(H8802)} the city{H5892}."
Ezekiel,48,19,And they that serve{H5647}{(H8802)} the city{H5892} shall serve{H5647}{(H8799)} it out of all the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}.
Ezekiel,48,20,"All the oblation{H8641} shall be five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} by five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505}: ye shall offer{H7311}{(H8686)} the holy{H6944} oblation{H8641} foursquare{H7243}, with the possession{H272} of the city{H5892}."
Ezekiel,48,21,"And the residue{H3498}{(H8737)} shall be for the prince{H5387}, on the one side and on the other of the holy{H6944} oblation{H8641}, and of the possession{H272} of the city{H5892}, over against{H6440} the five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} of the oblation{H8641} toward the east{H6921} border{H1366}, and westward{H3220} over against{H6440} the five{H2568} and twenty{H6242} thousand{H505} toward the west{H3220} border{H1366}, over against{H5980} the portions{H2506} for the prince{H5387}: and it shall be the holy{H6944} oblation{H8641}; and the sanctuary{H4720} of the house{H1004} shall be in the midst{H8432} thereof."
Ezekiel,48,22,"Moreover from the possession{H272} of the Levites{H3881}, and from the possession{H272} of the city{H5892}, being in the midst{H8432} of that which is the prince's{H5387}, between the border{H1366} of Judah{H3063} and the border{H1366} of Benjamin{H1144}, shall be for the prince{H5387}."
Ezekiel,48,23,"As for the rest{H3499} of the tribes{H7626}, from the east{H6921} side{H6285} unto the west{H3220} side{H6285}, Benjamin{H1144} shall have a{H259} portion."

Ezekiel,48,28,"And by the border{H1366} of Gad{H1410}, at the south{H5045} side{H6285} southward{H8486}, the border{H1366} shall be even from Tamar{H8559} unto the waters{H4325} of strife{H4808}{(H8677)}{H4809} in Kadesh{H6946}, and to the river{H5158} toward the great{H1419} sea{H3220}."
Ezekiel,48,29,"This is the land{H776} which ye shall divide{H5307}{(H8686)} by lot unto the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478} for inheritance{H5159}, and these are their portions{H4256}, saith{H5002}{(H8803)} the Lord{H136} GOD{H3069}."
Ezekiel,48,30,"And these are the goings out{H8444} of the city{H5892} on the north{H6828} side{H6285}, four{H702} thousand{H505} and five{H2568} hundred{H3967} measures{H4060}."
Ezekiel,48,31,"And the gates{H8179} of the city{H5892} shall be after the names{H8034} of the tribes{H7626} of Israel{H3478}: three{H7969} gates{H8179} northward{H6828}; one{H259} gate{H8179} of Reuben{H7205}, one{H259} gate{H8179} of Judah{H3063}, one{H259} gate{H8179} of Levi{H3878}."

Ezekiel,48,35,"It was round about{H5439} eighteen{H8083}{H6240} thousand{H505} measures: and the name{H8034} of the city{H5892} from that day{H3117} shall be, The LORD is there{H3074}."
Daniel,1,1,"In the third{H7969} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} came{H935}{(H8804)} Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} king{H4428} of Babylon{H894} unto Jerusalem{H3389}, and besieged{H6696}{(H8799)} it."
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord{H136} gave{H5414}{(H8799)} Jehoiakim{H3079} king{H4428} of Judah{H3063} into his hand{H3027}, with part{H7117} of the vessels{H3627} of the house{H1004} of God{H430}: which he carried{H935}{(H8686)} into the land{H776} of Shinar{H8152} to the house{H1004} of his god{H430}; and he brought{H935}{(H8689)} the vessels{H3627} into the treasure{H214} house{H1004} of his god{H430}."
Daniel,1,3,"And the king{H4428} spake{H559}{(H8799)} unto Ashpenaz{H828} the master{H7227} of his eunuchs{H5631}, that he should bring{H935}{(H8687)} certain of the children{H1121} of Israel{H3478}, and of the king's{H4410} seed{H2233}, and of the princes{H6579};"
Daniel,1,4,"Children{H3206} in whom was no blemish{H3971}{(H8675)}{H3971}, but well{H2896} favoured{H4758}, and skilful{H7919}{(H8688)} in all wisdom{H2451}, and cunning{H3045}{(H8802)} in knowledge{H1847}, and understanding{H995}{(H8688)} science{H4093}, and such as had ability{H3581} in them to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} in the king's{H4428} palace{H1964}, and whom they might teach{H3925}{(H8763)} the learning{H5612} and the tongue{H3956} of the Chaldeans{H3778}."
Daniel,1,5,"And the king{H4428} appointed{H4487}{(H8762)} them a daily{H3117}{H3117} provision{H1697} of the king's{H4428} meat{H6598}, and of the wine{H3196} which he drank{H4960}: so nourishing{H1431}{(H8763)} them three{H7969} years{H8141}, that at the end{H7117} thereof they might stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
Daniel,1,6,"Now among these were of the children{H1121} of Judah{H3063}, Daniel{H1840}, Hananiah{H2608}, Mishael{H4332}, and Azariah{H5838}:"
Daniel,1,7,"Unto whom the prince{H8269} of the eunuchs{H5631} gave{H7760}{(H8799)} names{H8034}: for he gave{H7760}{(H8799)} unto Daniel{H1840} the name of Belteshazzar{H1095}; and to Hananiah{H2608}, of Shadrach{H7714}; and to Mishael{H4332}, of Meshach{H4335}; and to Azariah{H5838}, of Abednego{H5664}."
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel{H1840} purposed{H7760}{(H8799)} in his heart{H3820} that he would not defile{H1351}{(H8691)} himself with the portion{H6598} of the king's{H4428} meat{H6598}, nor with the wine{H3196} which he drank{H4960}: therefore he requested{H1245}{(H8762)} of the prince{H8269} of the eunuchs{H5631} that he might not defile{H1351}{(H8691)} himself."
Daniel,1,9,Now God{H430} had brought{H5414}{(H8799)} Daniel{H1840} into favour{H2617} and tender love{H7356} with{H6440} the prince{H8269} of the eunuchs{H5631}.
Daniel,1,10,"And the prince{H8269} of the eunuchs{H5631} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto Daniel{H1840}, I fear{H3373} my lord{H113} the king{H4428}, who hath appointed{H4487}{(H8765)} your meat{H3978} and your drink{H4960}: for why should he see{H7200}{(H8799)} your faces{H6440} worse liking{H2196}{(H8802)} than the children{H3206} which are of your sort{H1524}? then shall ye make me endanger{H2325}{(H8765)} my head{H7218} to the king{H4428}."
Daniel,1,11,"Then said{H559}{(H8799)} Daniel{H1840} to Melzar{H4453}, whom the prince{H8269} of the eunuchs{H5631} had set{H4487}{(H8765)} over Daniel{H1840}, Hananiah{H2608}, Mishael{H4332}, and Azariah{H5838},"
Daniel,1,12,"Prove{H5254}{(H8761)} thy servants{H5650}, I beseech thee, ten{H6235} days{H3117}; and let them give{H5414}{(H8799)} us pulse{H2235} to eat{H398}{(H8799)}, and water{H4325} to drink{H8354}{(H8799)}."
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our countenances{H4758} be looked upon{H7200}{(H8735)} before{H6440} thee, and the countenance{H4758} of the children{H3206} that eat{H398}{(H8802)} of the portion{H6598} of the king's{H4428} meat{H6598}: and as thou seest{H7200}{(H8799)}, deal{H6213}{(H8798)} with thy servants{H5650}."
Daniel,1,14,"So he consented{H8085}{(H8799)} to them in this matter{H1697}, and proved{H5254}{(H8762)} them ten{H6235} days{H3117}."
Daniel,1,15,And at the end{H7117} of ten{H6235} days{H3117} their countenances{H4758} appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} fairer{H2896} and fatter{H1277} in flesh{H1320} than all the children{H3206} which did eat{H398}{(H8802)} the portion{H6598} of the king's{H4428} meat{H6598}.
Daniel,1,16,"Thus Melzar{H4453} took away{H5375}{(H8802)} the portion of their meat{H6598}, and the wine{H3196} that they should drink{H4960}; and gave{H5414}{(H8802)} them pulse{H2235}."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four{H702} children{H3206}, God{H430} gave{H5414}{(H8804)} them knowledge{H4093} and skill{H7919}{(H8687)} in all learning{H5612} and wisdom{H2451}: and Daniel{H1840} had understanding{H995}{(H8689)} in all visions{H2377} and dreams{H2472}."
Daniel,1,18,"Now at the end{H7117} of the days{H3117} that the king{H4428} had said{H559}{(H8804)} he should bring{H935}{(H8687)} them in, then the prince{H8269} of the eunuchs{H5631} brought{H935}{(H8686)} them in before{H6440} Nebuchadnezzar{H5019}."
Daniel,1,19,"And the king{H4428} communed{H1696}{(H8762)} with them; and among them all was found{H4672}{(H8738)} none like Daniel{H1840}, Hananiah{H2608}, Mishael{H4332}, and Azariah{H5838}: therefore stood{H5975}{(H8799)} they before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
Daniel,1,20,"And in all matters{H1697} of wisdom{H2451} and understanding{H998}, that the king{H4428} enquired{H1245}{(H8765)} of them, he found{H4672}{(H8799)} them ten times{H6235} better{H3027} than all the magicians{H2748} and astrologers{H825} that were in all his realm{H4438}."
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel{H1840} continued even unto the first{H259} year{H8141} of king{H4428} Cyrus{H3566}.
Daniel,2,1,"And in the second{H8147} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} Nebuchadnezzar{H5019} dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} dreams{H2472}, wherewith his spirit{H7307} was troubled{H6470}{(H8691)}, and his sleep{H8142} brake{H1961}{(H8738)} from him."
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king{H4428} commanded{H559}{(H8799)} to call{H7121}{(H8800)} the magicians{H2748}, and the astrologers{H825}, and the sorcerers{H3784}{(H8764)}, and the Chaldeans{H3778}, for to shew{H5046}{(H8687)} the king{H4428} his dreams{H2472}. So they came{H935}{(H8799)} and stood{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} the king{H4428}."
Daniel,2,3,"And the king{H4428} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto them, I have dreamed{H2492}{(H8804)} a dream{H2472}, and my spirit{H7307} was troubled{H6470}{(H8735)} to know{H3045}{(H8800)} the dream{H2472}."
Daniel,2,4,"Then spake{H1696}{(H8762)} the Chaldeans{H3778} to the king{H4428} in Syriack{H762}, O king{H4430}, live{H2418}{(H8747)} for ever{H5957}: tell{H560}{(H8747)} thy servants{H5649} the dream{H2493}, and we will shew{H2324}{(H8741)} the interpretation{H6591}."
Daniel,2,5,"The king{H4430} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} to the Chaldeans{H3779}, The thing{H4406} is gone{H230}{(H8754)} from me{H4481}: if{H2006} ye will not{H3809} make known{H3046}{(H8681)} unto me the dream{H2493}, with the interpretation{H6591} thereof, ye shall be cut{H5648}{(H8725)} in pieces{H1917}, and your houses{H1005} shall be made{H7761}{(H8725)} a dunghill{H5122}."
Daniel,2,6,"But if{H2006} ye shew{H2324}{(H8681)} the dream{H2493}, and the interpretation{H6591} thereof, ye shall receive{H6902}{(H8741)} of{H4481} me{H6925} gifts{H4978} and rewards{H5023} and great{H7690} honour{H3367}: therefore{H3861} shew{H2324}{(H8680)} me the dream{H2493}, and the interpretation{H6591} thereof."
Daniel,2,7,"They answered{H6032}{(H8754)} again{H8579} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Let the king{H4430} tell{H560}{(H8748)} his servants{H5649} the dream{H2493}, and we will shew{H2324}{(H8681)} the interpretation{H6591} of it."
Daniel,2,8,"The king{H4430} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, I{H576} know{H3046}{(H8751)} of{H4481} certainty{H3330} that ye{H608} would gain{H2084}{(H8750)} the time{H5732}, because{H6903}{H3606} ye see{H2370}{(H8754)} the thing{H4406} is gone{H230}{(H8754)} from{H4481} me."
Daniel,2,9,"But if{H2006} ye will not{H3809} make known{H3046}{(H8681)} unto me the dream{H2493}, there is but one{H1932}{H2298} decree{H1882} for you: for ye have prepared{H2164}{(H8724)} lying{H3538} and corrupt{H7844}{(H8752)} words{H4406} to speak{H560}{(H8749)} before{H6925} me, till{H5705} the time{H5732} be changed{H8133}{(H8721)}: therefore{H3861} tell{H560}{(H8747)} me the dream{H2493}, and I shall know{H3046}{(H8748)} that{H1768} ye can shew{H2324}{(H8681)} me the interpretation{H6591} thereof."
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans{H3779} answered{H6032}{(H8754)} before{H6925} the king{H4430}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, There is{H383} not{H3809} a man{H606} upon{H5922} the earth{H3007} that can{H3202}{(H8748)} shew{H2324}{(H8682)} the king's{H4430} matter{H4406}: therefore{H6903}{H1768} there is no{H3809} king{H4430}, lord{H7229}, nor ruler{H7990}, that asked{H7593}{(H8754)} such{H1836} things{H4406} at any{H3606} magician{H2749}, or astrologer{H826}, or Chaldean{H3779}."
Daniel,2,11,"And it is a rare{H3358} thing{H4406} that the king{H4430} requireth{H7593}{(H8751)}, and there is{H383} none{H3809} other{H321} that can shew{H2324}{(H8741)} it before{H6925} the king{H4430}, except{H3861} the gods{H426}, whose dwelling{H4070} is{H383} not{H3809} with{H5974} flesh{H1321}."
Daniel,2,12,"For{H6903} this{H1836} cause{H3606} the king{H4430} was angry{H1149}{(H8754)} and very{H7690} furious{H7108}{(H8754)}, and commanded{H560}{(H8754)} to destroy{H7}{(H8682)} all{H3606} the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}."
Daniel,2,13,And the decree{H1882} went forth{H5312}{(H8754)} that the wise{H2445} men should be slain{H6992}{(H8726)}; and they sought{H1156}{(H8754)} Daniel{H1841} and his fellows{H2269} to be slain{H6992}{(H8723)}.
Daniel,2,14,"Then{H116} Daniel{H1841} answered{H8421}{(H8684)} with counsel{H5843} and wisdom{H2942} to Arioch{H746} the captain{H7229} of{H1768} the king's{H4430} guard{H2877}, which was gone forth{H5312}{(H8754)} to slay{H6992}{(H8742)} the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}:"
Daniel,2,15,"He answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} to Arioch{H746} the king's{H4430} captain{H7990}, Why{H4101}{H5922} is the decree{H1882} so hasty{H2685}{(H8683)} from{H4481}{H6925} the king{H4430}? Then{H116} Arioch{H746} made the thing{H4406} known{H3046}{(H8684)} to Daniel{H1841}."
Daniel,2,16,"Then Daniel{H1841} went in{H5954}{(H8754)}, and desired{H1156}{(H8754)} of{H4481} the king{H4430} that he would give{H5415}{(H8748)} him time{H2166}, and that he would shew{H2324}{(H8682)} the king{H4430} the interpretation{H6591}."
Daniel,2,17,"Then{H116} Daniel{H1841} went{H236}{(H8754)} to his house{H1005}, and made the thing{H4406} known{H3046}{(H8684)} to Hananiah{H2608}, Mishael{H4333}, and Azariah{H5839}, his companions{H2269}:"
Daniel,2,18,That they would desire{H1156}{(H8749)} mercies{H7359} of{H4481}{H6925} the God{H426} of heaven{H8065} concerning{H5922} this{H1836} secret{H7328}; that Daniel{H1841} and his fellows{H2269} should not{H3809} perish{H7}{(H8681)} with{H5974} the rest{H7606} of the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}.
Daniel,2,19,Then{H116} was the secret{H7328} revealed{H1541}{(H8752)} unto Daniel{H1841} in a night{H3916} vision{H2376}. Then{H116} Daniel{H1841} blessed{H1289}{(H8745)} the God{H426} of heaven{H8065}.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel{H1841} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Blessed{H1289}{(H8743)} be{H1934}{(H8748)} the name{H8036} of God{H426} for{H4481} ever{H5957} and ever{H5705}{H5957}: for wisdom{H2452} and might{H1370} are{H1932} his:"
Daniel,2,21,"And he changeth{H8133}{(H8683)} the times{H5732} and the seasons{H2166}: he removeth{H5709}{(H8683)} kings{H4430}, and setteth up{H6966}{(H8683)} kings{H4430}: he giveth{H3052}{(H8751)} wisdom{H2452} unto the wise{H2445}, and knowledge{H4486} to them that know{H3046}{(H8751)} understanding{H999}:"
Daniel,2,22,"He revealeth{H1541}{(H8751)} the deep{H5994} and secret things{H5642}{(H8743)}: he knoweth{H3046}{(H8751)} what{H4101} is in the darkness{H2816}, and the light{H5094} dwelleth{H8271}{(H8754)} with him{H5974}."
Daniel,2,23,"I{H576} thank{H3029}{(H8683)} thee, and praise{H7624}{(H8743)} thee, O thou God{H426} of my fathers{H2}, who hast given{H3052}{(H8754)} me wisdom{H2452} and might{H1370}, and hast made known{H3046}{(H8684)} unto me now{H3705} what we desired{H1156}{(H8754)} of thee{H4481}: for thou hast now made known{H3046}{(H8684)} unto us the king's{H4430} matter{H4406}."
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore{H3606}{H6903}{H1836} Daniel{H1841} went in{H5954}{(H8754)} unto{H5922} Arioch{H746}, whom the king{H4430} had ordained{H4483}{(H8745)} to destroy{H7}{(H8682)} the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}: he went{H236}{(H8754)} and said{H560}{(H8754)} thus{H3652} unto him; Destroy{H7}{(H8681)} not{H409} the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}: bring me in{H5954}{(H8680)} before{H6925} the king{H4430}, and I will shew{H2324}{(H8741)} unto the king{H4430} the interpretation{H6591}."
Daniel,2,25,"Then{H116} Arioch{H746} brought in{H5954}{(H8684)} Daniel{H1841} before{H6925} the king{H4430} in haste{H927}{(H8726)}, and said{H560}{(H8754)} thus{H3652} unto him, I have found{H7912}{(H8684)} a man{H1400} of the captives{H1123}{H1547} of{H4481} Judah{H3061}, that will make known{H3046}{(H8681)} unto the king{H4430} the interpretation{H6591}."
Daniel,2,26,"The king{H4430} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} to Daniel{H1841}, whose name{H8036} was Belteshazzar{H1096}, Art{H383} thou able{H3546}{(H8751)} to make known{H3046}{(H8682)} unto me the dream{H2493} which I have seen{H2370}{(H8754)}, and the interpretation{H6591} thereof?"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel{H1841} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} in the presence{H6925} of the king{H4430}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, The secret{H7328} which the king{H4430} hath demanded{H7593}{(H8751)} cannot{H3202}{(H8750)}{H3809} the wise{H2445} men, the astrologers{H826}, the magicians{H2749}, the soothsayers{H1505}{(H8750)}, shew{H2324}{(H8682)} unto the king{H4430};"
Daniel,2,28,"But{H1297} there is{H383} a God{H426} in heaven{H8065} that revealeth{H1541}{(H8751)} secrets{H7328}, and maketh known{H3046}{(H8684)} to the king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} what{H4101} shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} in the latter{H320} days{H3118}. Thy dream{H2493}, and the visions{H2376} of thy head{H7217} upon{H5922} thy bed{H4903}, are these{H1836};"
Daniel,2,29,"As for thee{H607}, O king{H4430}, thy thoughts{H7476} came{H5559}{(H8760)} into thy mind upon{H5922} thy bed{H4903}, what{H4101} should come to pass{H1934}{(H8748)} hereafter{H311}{H1836}: and he that revealeth{H1541}{(H8751)} secrets{H7328} maketh known{H3046}{(H8684)} to thee what{H4101} shall come to pass{H1934}{(H8748)}."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me{H576}, this{H1836} secret{H7328} is not{H3809} revealed{H1541}{(H8752)} to me for any wisdom{H2452} that I have{H383} more than{H4481} any{H3606} living{H2417}, but{H3861} for their sakes{H1701} that{H5922} shall make known{H3046}{(H8681)} the interpretation{H6591} to the king{H4430}, and that thou mightest know{H3046}{(H8748)} the thoughts{H7476} of thy heart{H3825}."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou{H607}, O king{H4430}, sawest{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)}, and behold{H431} a great{H2298}{H7690} image{H6755}. This{H1797} great{H7229} image{H6755}, whose brightness{H2122} was excellent{H3493}, stood{H6966}{(H8750)} before{H6903} thee; and the form{H7299} thereof was terrible{H1763}{(H8753)}."
Daniel,2,32,"This image's{H6755} head{H7217} was of fine{H2869} gold{H1722}, his breast{H2306} and his arms{H1872} of silver{H3702}, his belly{H4577} and his thighs{H3410} of brass{H5174},"
Daniel,2,33,"His legs{H8243} of iron{H6523}, his feet{H7271} part{H4481} of iron{H6523} and part{H4481} of clay{H2635}."
Daniel,2,34,"Thou sawest{H2370}{(H8751)}{H1934}{(H8754)} till{H5705} that a stone{H69} was cut out{H1505}{(H8728)} without{H3809} hands{H3028}, which smote{H4223}{(H8754)} the image{H6755} upon{H5922} his feet{H7271} that were of iron{H6523} and clay{H2635}, and brake{H1855} them{H1994} to pieces{H1855}{(H8684)}."
Daniel,2,35,"Then{H116} was the iron{H6523}, the clay{H2635}, the brass{H5174}, the silver{H3702}, and the gold{H1722}, broken to pieces{H1855}{(H8754)}{(H8676)}{H1751}{(H8754)} together{H2298}, and became{H1934}{(H8754)} like the chaff{H5784} of{H4481} the summer{H7007} threshingfloors{H147}; and the wind{H7308} carried{H5376} them{H1994} away{H5376}{(H8754)}, that{H3606} no{H3809} place{H870} was found{H7912}{(H8728)} for them: and the stone{H69} that smote{H4223}{(H8754)} the image{H6755} became{H1934}{(H8754)} a great{H7229} mountain{H2906}, and filled{H4391}{(H8754)} the whole{H3606} earth{H772}."
Daniel,2,36,This{H1836} is the dream{H2493}; and we will tell{H560}{(H8748)} the interpretation{H6591} thereof before{H6925} the king{H4430}.
Daniel,2,37,"Thou{H607}, O king{H4430}, art a king{H4430} of kings{H4430}: for the God{H426} of heaven{H8065} hath given{H3052}{(H8754)} thee a kingdom{H4437}, power{H2632}, and strength{H8632}, and glory{H3367}."
Daniel,2,38,"And wheresoever{H3606} the children{H1123} of men{H606} dwell{H1753}{(H8748)}, the beasts{H2423} of the field{H1251} and the fowls{H5776} of the heaven{H8065} hath he given{H3052}{(H8754)} into thine hand{H3028}, and hath made thee ruler{H7981}{(H8684)} over them all{H3606}. Thou{H607} art this head{H7217} of gold{H1722}."
Daniel,2,39,"And after{H870} thee shall arise{H6966}{(H8748)} another{H317} kingdom{H4437} inferior{H772} to thee{H4481}, and another{H317} third{H8523} kingdom{H4437} of brass{H5174}, which shall bear rule{H7981}{(H8748)} over all{H3606} the earth{H772}."
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth{H7244} kingdom{H4437} shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} strong{H8624} as iron{H6523}: forasmuch as iron{H6523} breaketh in pieces{H1855}{(H8683)} and subdueth{H2827}{(H8751)} all{H3606} things: and as{H6903} iron{H6523} that breaketh{H7490}{(H8750)} all{H3606} these{H459}, shall it break in pieces{H1855}{(H8681)} and bruise{H7490}{(H8748)}."
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest{H2370}{(H8754)} the feet{H7271} and toes{H677}, part{H4481} of potters{H6353}' clay{H2635}, and part{H4481} of iron{H6523}, the kingdom{H4437} shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} divided{H6386}{(H8752)}; but{H4481} there shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} in it of{H4481} the strength{H5326} of the iron{H6523}, forasmuch as{H3606}{H6903} thou sawest{H2370}{(H8754)} the iron{H6523} mixed{H6151}{(H8743)} with miry{H2917} clay{H2635}."
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes{H677} of the feet{H7271} were part{H4481} of iron{H6523}, and part{H4481} of clay{H2635}, so the kingdom{H4437} shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} partly{H4481}{H7118} strong{H8624}, and partly{H4481}{H7118} broken{H8406}{(H8750)}."
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas{H1768} thou sawest{H2370}{(H8754)} iron{H6523} mixed{H6151}{(H8743)} with miry{H2917} clay{H2635}, they shall mingle themselves{H1934}{(H8748)}{H6151}{(H8723)} with the seed{H2234} of men{H606}: but they shall{H1934}{(H8748)} not{H3809} cleave{H1693}{(H8751)} one{H1836} to{H5974} another{H1836}, even{H1888} as iron{H6523} is not{H3809} mixed{H6151}{(H8723)} with clay{H2635}."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days{H3118} of these{H581} kings{H4430} shall the God{H426} of heaven{H8065} set up{H6966}{(H8681)} a kingdom{H4437}, which shall never{H5957}{H3809} be destroyed{H2255}{(H8721)}: and the kingdom{H4437} shall not{H3809} be left{H7662}{(H8721)} to other{H321} people{H5972}, but it shall break in pieces{H1855}{(H8681)} and consume{H5487}{(H8681)} all{H3606} these{H459} kingdoms{H4437}, and it{H1932} shall stand{H6966}{(H8748)} for ever{H5957}."
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as{H3606}{H6903} thou sawest{H2370}{(H8754)} that the stone{H69} was cut out{H1505}{(H8728)} of the mountain{H2906} without{H3809} hands{H3028}, and that it brake in pieces{H1855}{(H8684)} the iron{H6523}, the brass{H5174}, the clay{H2635}, the silver{H3702}, and the gold{H1722}; the great{H7229} God{H426} hath made known{H3046}{(H8684)} to the king{H4430} what{H4101} shall come to pass{H1934}{(H8748)} hereafter{H311}{H1836}: and the dream{H2493} is certain{H3330}, and the interpretation{H6591} thereof sure{H540}{(H8683)}."
Daniel,2,46,"Then{H116} the king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} fell{H5308}{(H8754)} upon{H5922} his face{H600}, and worshipped{H5457}{(H8754)} Daniel{H1841}, and commanded{H560}{(H8754)} that they should offer{H5260}{(H8742)} an oblation{H4504} and sweet odours{H5208} unto him."
Daniel,2,47,"The king{H4430} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} unto Daniel{H1841}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Of{H4481} a truth{H7187} it is, that{H1768} your God{H426} is a God{H426} of gods{H426}, and a Lord{H4756} of kings{H4430}, and a revealer{H1541}{(H8751)} of secrets{H7328}, seeing thou couldest{H3202}{(H8754)} reveal{H1541}{(H8749)} this{H1836} secret{H7328}."
Daniel,2,48,"Then{H116} the king{H4430} made{H7236} Daniel{H1841} a great man{H7236}{(H8745)}, and gave{H3052}{(H8754)} him many{H7690} great{H7260} gifts{H4978}, and made him ruler{H7981}{(H8684)} over{H5922} the whole{H3606} province{H4083} of Babylon{H895}, and chief{H7229} of the governors{H5460} over{H5922} all{H3606} the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}."
Daniel,2,49,"Then Daniel{H1841} requested{H1156}{(H8754)} of{H4481} the king{H4430}, and he set{H4483}{(H8745)} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, over{H5922} the affairs{H5673} of the province{H4083} of Babylon{H895}: but Daniel{H1841} sat in the gate{H8651} of the king{H4430}."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} made{H5648}{(H8754)} an image{H6755} of gold{H1722}, whose height{H7314} was threescore{H8361} cubits{H521}, and the breadth{H6613} thereof six{H8353} cubits{H521}: he set it up{H6966}{(H8684)} in the plain{H1236} of Dura{H1757}, in the province{H4083} of Babylon{H895}."
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} sent{H7972}{(H8754)} to gather together{H3673}{(H8749)} the princes{H324}, the governors{H5460}, and the captains{H6347}, the judges{H148}, the treasurers{H1411}, the counsellors{H1884}, the sheriffs{H8614}, and all{H3606} the rulers{H7984} of the provinces{H4083}, to come{H858}{(H8749)} to the dedication{H2597} of the image{H6755} which Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} had set up{H6966}{(H8684)}."
Daniel,3,3,"Then{H116} the princes{H324}, the governors{H5460}, and captains{H6347}, the judges{H148}, the treasurers{H1411}, the counsellors{H1884}, the sheriffs{H8614}, and all{H3606} the rulers{H7984} of the provinces{H4083}, were gathered together{H3673}{(H8723)} unto the dedication{H2597} of the image{H6755} that Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} had set up{H6966}{(H8684)}; and they stood{H6966}{(H8750)} before{H6903} the image{H6755} that Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} had set up{H6966}{(H8684)}."
Daniel,3,4,"Then an herald{H3744} cried{H7123}{(H8751)} aloud{H2429}, To you it is commanded{H560}{(H8750)}, O people{H5972}, nations{H524}, and languages{H3961},"
Daniel,3,5,"That at what time{H5732} ye hear{H8086}{(H8748)} the sound{H7032} of the cornet{H7162}, flute{H4953}, harp{H7030}{(H8675)}{H7030}, sackbut{H5443}, psaltery{H6460}, dulcimer{H5481}, and all{H3606} kinds{H2178} of musick{H2170}, ye fall down{H5308}{(H8748)} and worship{H5457}{(H8748)} the golden{H1722} image{H6755} that Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} hath set up{H6966}{(H8684)}:"
Daniel,3,6,And whoso{H4479} falleth{H5308} not{H3809} down{H5308}{(H8748)} and worshippeth{H5457}{(H8748)} shall the same hour{H8160} be cast{H7412}{(H8729)} into the midst{H1459} of a burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}.
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore{H6903}{H1836} at that time{H2166}, when{H1768} all{H3606} the people{H5972} heard{H8086}{(H8750)} the sound{H7032} of the cornet{H7162}, flute{H4953}, harp{H7030}{(H8675)}{H7030}, sackbut{H5443}, psaltery{H6460}, and all{H3606} kinds{H2178} of musick{H2170}, all{H3606} the people{H5972}, the nations{H524}, and the languages{H3961}, fell down{H5308}{(H8750)} and worshipped{H5457}{(H8750)} the golden{H1722} image{H6755} that Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} had set up{H6966}{(H8684)}."
Daniel,3,8,"Wherefore{H6903}{H3606} at that{H1836} time{H2166} certain{H1400} Chaldeans{H3779} came near{H7127}{(H8754)}, and accused{H7170}{H399}{(H8754)} the Jews{H3062}."
Daniel,3,9,"They spake{H6032}{(H8754)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} to the king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020}, O king{H4430}, live{H2418}{(H8747)} for ever{H5957}."
Daniel,3,10,"Thou{H607}, O king{H4430}, hast made{H7761}{(H8754)} a decree{H2942}, that every{H3606} man{H606} that shall hear{H8086}{(H8748)} the sound{H7032} of the cornet{H7162}, flute{H4953}, harp{H7030}{(H8675)}{H7030}, sackbut{H5443}, psaltery{H6460}, and dulcimer{H5481}{(H8675)}{H5481}, and all{H3606} kinds{H2178} of musick{H2170}, shall fall down{H5308}{(H8748)} and worship{H5457}{(H8748)} the golden{H1722} image{H6755}:"
Daniel,3,11,"And whoso{H4479} falleth{H5308} not{H3809} down{H5308}{(H8748)} and worshippeth{H5457}{(H8748)}, that he should be cast{H7412}{(H8729)} into the midst{H1459} of a burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}."
Daniel,3,12,"There are{H383} certain{H1400} Jews{H3062} whom{H3487} thou hast set{H4483}{(H8745)} over{H5922} the affairs{H5673} of the province{H4083} of Babylon{H895}, Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}; these{H479} men{H1400}, O king{H4430}, have{H7761}{(H8754)} not{H3809} regarded{H2942} thee{H5922}: they serve{H6399}{(H8750)} not{H3809} thy gods{H426}, nor{H3809} worship{H5457}{(H8750)} the golden{H1722} image{H6755} which thou hast set up{H6966}{(H8684)}."
Daniel,3,13,"Then{H116} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} in his rage{H7266} and fury{H2528} commanded{H560}{(H8754)} to bring{H858}{(H8682)} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}. Then{H116} they brought{H858}{(H8717)} these{H479} men{H1400} before{H6925} the king{H4430}."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} spake{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} unto them, Is it true{H6656}, O Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, do not{H3809} ye{H383} serve{H6399}{(H8750)} my gods{H426}, nor{H3809} worship{H5457}{(H8750)} the golden{H1722} image{H6755} which I have set{H6966}{(H8684)} up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now{H3705} if{H2006} ye be{H383} ready{H6263} that at what time{H5732} ye hear{H8086}{(H8748)} the sound{H7032} of the cornet{H7162}, flute{H4953}, harp{H7030}{(H8675)}{H7030}, sackbut{H5443}, psaltery{H6460}, and dulcimer{H5481}, and all{H3606} kinds{H2178} of musick{H2170}, ye fall down{H5308}{(H8748)} and worship{H5457}{(H8748)} the image{H6755} which I have made{H5648}{(H8754)}; well: but if{H2006} ye worship{H5457}{(H8748)} not{H3809}, ye shall be cast{H7412}{(H8729)} the same hour{H8160} into the midst{H1459} of a burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}; and who{H4479} is that God{H426} that shall deliver{H7804}{(H8755)} you out of{H4481} my hands{H3028}?"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, answered{H6032}{(H8754)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} to the king{H4430}, O Nebuchadnezzar{H5020}, we{H586} are not{H3809} careful{H2818}{(H8750)} to answer{H8421}{(H8682)} thee in{H5922} this{H1836} matter{H6600}."
Daniel,3,17,"If{H2006} it be so, our God{H426} whom we{H586} serve{H6399}{(H8750)} is{H383} able{H3202}{(H8750)} to deliver{H7804}{(H8756)} us from{H4481} the burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}, and{H4481} he will deliver{H7804}{(H8755)} us out of{H4481} thine hand{H3028}, O king{H4430}."
Daniel,3,18,"But if{H2006} not{H3809}, be it{H1934}{(H8748)} known{H3046}{(H8752)} unto thee, O king{H4430}, that we will{H383} not{H3809} serve{H6399}{(H8750)} thy gods{H426}, nor{H3809} worship{H5457}{(H8748)} the golden{H1722} image{H6755} which thou hast set up{H6966}{(H8684)}."
Daniel,3,19,"Then{H116} was Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} full{H4391}{(H8728)} of fury{H2528}, and the form{H6755} of his visage{H600} was changed{H8133}{(H8724)} against{H5922} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}: therefore he spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and commanded{H560}{(H8750)} that they should heat{H228}{(H8749)} the furnace{H861} one{H2298} seven times{H7655} more{H5922} than{H1768} it was wont{H2370}{(H8752)} to be heated{H228}{(H8749)}."
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded{H560}{(H8754)} the most{H2429} mighty{H1401} men{H1400} that were in his army{H2429} to bind{H3729}{(H8742)} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, and to cast{H7412}{(H8749)} them into the burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}."
Daniel,3,21,"Then{H116} these{H479} men{H1400} were bound{H3729}{(H8760)} in their coats{H5622}, their hosen{H6361}{(H8675)}{H6361}, and their hats{H3737}, and their other garments{H3831}, and were cast{H7412}{(H8752)} into the midst{H1459} of the burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}."
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore{H3606}{H6903} because{H4481}{H1836} the king's{H4430} commandment{H4406} was urgent{H2685}{(H8683)}, and the furnace{H861} exceeding{H3493} hot{H228}{(H8752)}, the flame{H7631} of the fire{H5135} slew{H6992}{(H8745)} those{H479} men{H1400}{H1994} that took up{H5267}{(H8684)} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}."
Daniel,3,23,"And these{H479} three{H8532} men{H1400}, Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, fell down{H5308}{(H8754)} bound{H3729}{(H8743)} into the midst{H1459} of the burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}."
Daniel,3,24,"Then{H116} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430} was astonied{H8429}{(H8754)}, and rose up{H6966}{(H8754)} in haste{H927}{(H8726)}, and spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8750)} unto his counsellors{H1907}, Did not{H3809} we cast{H7412}{(H8754)} three{H8532} men{H1400} bound{H3729}{(H8743)} into the midst{H1459} of the fire{H5135}? They answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} unto the king{H4430}, True{H3330}, O king{H4430}."
Daniel,3,25,"He answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Lo{H1888}, I{H576} see{H2370}{(H8751)} four{H703} men{H1400} loose{H8271}{(H8750)}, walking{H1981}{(H8683)} in the midst{H1459} of the fire{H5135}, and they have{H383} no{H3809} hurt{H2257}; and the form{H7299} of the fourth{H7244} is like{H1821}{(H8751)} the Son{H1247} of God{H426}."
Daniel,3,26,"Then{H116} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} came near{H7127}{(H8754)} to the mouth{H8651} of the burning{H3345}{(H8751)} fiery{H5135} furnace{H861}, and spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, ye servants{H5649} of the most high{H5943} God{H426}, come forth{H5312}{(H8747)}, and come{H858}{(H8747)} hither. Then{H116} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, came forth{H5312}{(H8750)} of{H4481} the midst{H1459} of the fire{H5135}."
Daniel,3,27,"And the princes{H324}, governors{H5460}, and captains{H6347}, and the king's{H4430} counsellors{H1907}, being gathered together{H3673}{(H8723)}, saw{H2370}{(H8751)} these{H479} men{H1400}, upon whose bodies{H1655} the fire{H5135} had no{H3809} power{H7981}{(H8754)}, nor{H3809} was an hair{H8177} of their head{H7217} singed{H2761}{(H8724)}, neither{H3809} were their coats{H5622} changed{H8133}{(H8754)}, nor{H3809} the smell{H7382} of fire{H5135} had passed{H5709}{(H8754)} on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Then Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Blessed{H1289}{(H8752)} be the God{H426} of Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, who hath sent{H7972}{(H8754)} his angel{H4398}, and delivered{H7804}{(H8758)} his servants{H5649} that trusted{H7365}{(H8702)} in him{H5922}, and have changed{H8133}{(H8745)} the king's{H4430} word{H4406}, and yielded{H3052}{(H8754)} their bodies{H1655}, that they might not{H3809} serve{H6399}{(H8748)} nor{H3809} worship{H5457}{(H8748)} any{H3606} god{H426}, except{H3861} their own God{H426}."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I{H4481} make{H7761}{(H8752)} a decree{H2942}, That every{H3606} people{H5972}, nation{H524}, and language{H3961}, which speak{H560}{(H8748)} any thing amiss{H7960}{(H8675)}{H7955} against{H5922} the God{H426} of Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, shall be cut{H5648}{(H8725)} in pieces{H1917}, and their houses{H1005} shall be made{H7739}{(H8721)} a dunghill{H5122}: because{H6903}{H3606} there is{H383} no{H3809} other{H321} God{H426} that can{H3202}{(H8748)} deliver{H5338}{(H8682)} after this{H1836} sort."
Daniel,3,30,"Then{H116} the king{H4430} promoted{H6744}{(H8684)} Shadrach{H7715}, Meshach{H4336}, and Abednego{H5665}, in the province{H4083} of Babylon{H895}."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} the king{H4430}, unto all{H3606} people{H5972}, nations{H524}, and languages{H3961}, that dwell{H1753}{(H8748)} in all{H3606} the earth{H772}; Peace{H8001} be multiplied{H7680}{(H8748)} unto you."
Daniel,4,2,I thought{H6925} it good{H8232}{(H8754)} to shew{H2324}{(H8682)} the signs{H852} and wonders{H8540} that the high{H5943} God{H426} hath wrought{H5648}{(H8754)} toward{H5974} me.
Daniel,4,3,"How{H4101} great{H7260} are his signs{H852}! and how{H4101} mighty{H8624} are his wonders{H8540}! his kingdom{H4437} is an everlasting{H5957} kingdom{H4437}, and his dominion{H7985} is from{H5974} generation{H1859} to generation{H1859}."
Daniel,4,4,"I{H576} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} was{H1934}{(H8754)} at rest{H7954}{(H8752)} in mine house{H1005}, and flourishing{H7487} in my palace{H1965}:"
Daniel,4,5,"I saw{H2370}{(H8754)} a dream{H2493} which made me afraid{H1763}{(H8741)}, and the thoughts{H2031} upon{H5922} my bed{H4903} and the visions{H2376} of my head{H7217} troubled{H927}{(H8792)} me."
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore{H4481} made{H7761}{(H8752)} I{H4481} a decree{H2942} to bring{H5954}{(H8682)} in all{H3606} the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895} before{H6925} me, that they might make known{H3046}{(H8681)} unto me the interpretation{H6591} of the dream{H2493}."
Daniel,4,7,"Then{H116} came{H5954}{(H8750)} in the magicians{H2749}, the astrologers{H826}, the Chaldeans{H3779}, and the soothsayers{H1505}{(H8750)}: and I{H576} told{H560}{(H8750)} the dream{H2493} before{H6925} them; but they did not{H3809} make known{H3046}{(H8683)} unto me the interpretation{H6591} thereof."
Daniel,4,8,"But at{H5705} the last{H318} Daniel{H1841} came in{H5922} before me{H6925}, whose name{H8036} was Belteshazzar{H1096}, according to the name{H8036} of my god{H426}, and in whom is the spirit{H7308} of the holy{H6922} gods{H426}: and before{H6925} him I told{H560}{(H8754)} the dream{H2493}, saying,"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belteshazzar{H1096}, master{H7229} of the magicians{H2749}, because I{H576} know{H3046}{(H8754)} that the spirit{H7308} of the holy{H6922} gods{H426} is in thee, and no{H3606}{H3809} secret{H7328} troubleth{H598}{(H8750)} thee, tell{H560}{(H8747)} me the visions{H2376} of my dream{H2493} that I have seen{H2370}{(H8754)}, and the interpretation{H6591} thereof."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus were the visions{H2376} of mine head{H7217} in{H5922} my bed{H4903}; I saw{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)}, and behold{H431} a tree{H363} in the midst{H1459} of the earth{H772}, and the height{H7314} thereof was great{H7690}."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree{H363} grew{H7236}{(H8754)}, and was strong{H8631}{(H8754)}, and the height{H7314} thereof reached{H4291}{(H8748)} unto heaven{H8065}, and the sight{H2379} thereof to the end{H5491} of all{H3606} the earth{H772}:"
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves{H6074} thereof were fair{H8209}, and the fruit{H4} thereof much{H7690}, and in it was meat{H4203} for all{H3606}: the beasts{H2423} of the field{H1251} had shadow{H2927}{(H8681)} under{H8460} it, and the fowls{H6853} of the heaven{H8065} dwelt{H1753}{(H8748)} in the boughs{H6056} thereof, and all{H3606} flesh{H1321} was fed{H2110}{(H8729)} of it{H4481}."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} in the visions{H2376} of my head{H7217} upon{H5922} my bed{H4903}, and, behold{H431}, a watcher{H5894} and an holy one{H6922} came down{H5182}{(H8750)} from{H4481} heaven{H8065};"
Daniel,4,14,"He cried{H7123}{(H8751)} aloud{H2429}, and said{H560}{(H8750)} thus{H3652}, Hew down{H1414} the tree{H363}, and cut off{H7113}{(H8745)} his branches{H6056}, shake off{H5426}{(H8680)} his leaves{H6074}, and scatter{H921}{(H8745)} his fruit{H4}: let the beasts{H2423} get away{H5111}{(H8748)} from{H4481} under it{H8479}, and the fowls{H6853} from{H4481} his branches{H6056}:"
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless{H1297} leave{H7662}{(H8747)} the stump{H6136} of his roots{H8330} in the earth{H772}, even with a band{H613} of iron{H6523} and brass{H5174}, in the tender grass{H1883} of the field{H1251}; and let it be wet{H6647}{(H8721)} with the dew{H2920} of heaven{H8065}, and let his portion{H2508} be with{H5974} the beasts{H2423} in the grass{H6211} of the earth{H772}:"
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart{H3825} be changed{H8133}{(H8741)} from{H4481} man's{H606}, and let a beast's{H2423} heart{H3825} be given{H3052}{(H8725)} unto him; and let seven{H7655} times{H5732} pass{H2499} over{H5922} him."
Daniel,4,17,"This matter{H6600} is by the decree{H1510} of the watchers{H5894}, and the demand{H7595} by the word{H3983} of the holy ones{H6922}: to{H5705} the intent{H1701} that the living{H2417} may know{H3046}{(H8748)} that the most High{H5943} ruleth{H7990} in the kingdom{H4437} of men{H606}, and giveth{H5415}{(H8748)} it to whomsoever{H4479} he will{H6634}{(H8748)}, and setteth up{H6966}{(H8681)} over{H5922} it the basest{H8215} of men{H606}."
Daniel,4,18,"This{H1836} dream{H2493} I{H576} king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} have seen{H2370}{(H8754)}. Now thou{H607}, O Belteshazzar{H1096}, declare{H560}{(H8747)} the interpretation{H6591} thereof, forasmuch as{H6903} all{H3606} the wise{H2445} men of my kingdom{H4437} are not{H3809} able{H3202}{(H8750)} to make known{H3046}{(H8682)} unto me the interpretation{H6591}: but thou{H607} art able{H3546}{(H8751)}; for the spirit{H7308} of the holy{H6922} gods{H426} is in thee."
Daniel,4,19,"Then{H116} Daniel{H1841}, whose name{H8036} was Belteshazzar{H1096}, was astonied{H8075}{(H8733)} for one{H2298} hour{H8160}, and his thoughts{H7476} troubled{H927}{(H8792)} him. The king{H4430} spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Belteshazzar{H1096}, let not{H409} the dream{H2493}, or the interpretation{H6591} thereof, trouble{H927}{(H8792)} thee. Belteshazzar{H1096} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, My lord{H4756}, the dream{H2493} be to them that hate{H8131}{(H8750)} thee, and the interpretation{H6591} thereof to thine enemies{H6146}."
Daniel,4,20,"The tree{H363} that thou sawest{H2370}{(H8754)}, which grew{H7236}{(H8754)}, and was strong{H8631}{(H8754)}, whose height{H7314} reached{H4291}{(H8748)} unto the heaven{H8065}, and the sight{H2379} thereof to all{H3606} the earth{H772};"
Daniel,4,21,"Whose leaves{H6074} were fair{H8209}, and the fruit{H4} thereof much{H7690}, and in it was meat{H4203} for all{H3606}; under{H8460} which the beasts{H2423} of the field{H1251} dwelt{H1753}{(H8748)}, and upon whose branches{H6056} the fowls{H6853} of the heaven{H8065} had their habitation{H7932}{(H8748)}:"
Daniel,4,22,"It is thou{H607}, O king{H4430}, that art grown{H7236}{(H8754)} and become strong{H8631}{(H8748)}: for thy greatness{H7238} is grown{H7236}{(H8754)}, and reacheth{H4291}{(H8754)} unto heaven{H8065}, and thy dominion{H7985} to the end{H5491} of the earth{H772}."
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king{H4430} saw{H2370}{(H8754)} a watcher{H5894} and an holy one{H6922} coming down{H5182}{(H8750)} from{H4481} heaven{H8065}, and saying{H560}{(H8750)}, Hew{H1414} the tree{H363} down{H1414}, and destroy{H2255}{(H8740)} it; yet{H1297} leave{H7662}{(H8747)} the stump{H6136} of the roots{H8330} thereof in the earth{H772}, even with a band{H613} of iron{H6523} and brass{H5174}, in the tender grass{H1883} of the field{H1251}; and let it be wet{H6647}{(H8721)} with the dew{H2920} of heaven{H8065}, and let his portion{H2508} be with{H5974} the beasts{H2423} of the field{H1251}, till{H5705} seven{H7655} times{H5732} pass{H2499} over{H5922} him;"
Daniel,4,24,"This{H1836} is the interpretation{H6591}, O king{H4430}, and this{H1932} is the decree{H1510} of the most High{H5943}, which is come{H4291}{(H8754)} upon{H5922} my lord{H4756} the king{H4430}:"
Daniel,4,25,"That they shall drive{H2957}{(H8751)} thee from{H4481} men{H606}, and thy dwelling{H4070} shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} with{H5974} the beasts{H2423} of the field{H1251}, and they shall make thee to eat{H2939}{(H8748)} grass{H6211} as oxen{H8450}, and they shall wet{H6647}{(H8743)} thee with the dew{H2920} of heaven{H8065}, and seven{H7655} times{H5732} shall pass{H2499} over{H5922} thee, till{H5705} thou know{H3046}{(H8748)} that the most High{H5943} ruleth{H7990} in the kingdom{H4437} of men{H606}, and giveth{H5415}{(H8748)} it to whomsoever{H4479} he will{H6634}{(H8748)}."
Daniel,4,26,"And whereas they commanded{H560}{(H8754)} to leave{H7662}{(H8749)} the stump{H6136} of the tree{H363} roots{H8330}; thy kingdom{H4437} shall be sure{H7011} unto thee, after{H4481} that thou shalt have known{H3046}{(H8748)} that the heavens{H8065} do rule{H7990}."
Daniel,4,27,"Wherefore{H3861}, O king{H4430}, let my counsel{H4431} be acceptable{H8232}{(H8748)} unto thee{H5922}, and break off{H6562}{(H8747)} thy sins{H2408} by righteousness{H6665}, and thine iniquities{H5758} by shewing mercy{H2604}{(H8749)} to the poor{H6033}{(H8750)}; if{H2006} it may be{H1934}{(H8748)} a lengthening{H754} of thy tranquillity{H7963}."
Daniel,4,28,All{H3606} this came{H4291}{(H8754)} upon{H5922} the king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020}.
Daniel,4,29,At the end{H7118} of twelve{H8648}{H6236} months{H3393} he walked{H1934}{(H8754)}{H1981}{(H8750)} in{H5922} the palace{H1965} of the kingdom{H4437} of Babylon{H895}.
Daniel,4,30,"The king{H4430} spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8750)}, Is not{H3809} this{H1932}{H1668} great{H7229} Babylon{H895}, that I{H576} have built{H1124}{(H8754)} for the house{H1005} of the kingdom{H4437} by the might{H8632} of my power{H2632}, and for the honour{H3367} of my majesty{H1923}?"
Daniel,4,31,"While{H5751} the word{H4406} was in the king's{H4430} mouth{H6433}, there fell{H5308}{(H8754)} a voice{H7032} from{H4481} heaven{H8065}, saying, O king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020}, to thee it is spoken{H560}{(H8750)}; The kingdom{H4437} is departed{H5709}{(H8754)} from{H4481} thee."
Daniel,4,32,"And they shall drive{H2957}{(H8751)} thee from{H4481} men{H606}, and thy dwelling{H4070} shall be with{H5974} the beasts{H2423} of the field{H1251}: they shall make thee to eat{H2939}{(H8748)} grass{H6211} as oxen{H8450}, and seven{H7655} times{H5732} shall pass{H2499} over{H5922} thee, until{H5705} thou know{H3046}{(H8748)} that the most High{H5943} ruleth{H7990} in the kingdom{H4437} of men{H606}, and giveth{H5415}{(H8748)} it to whomsoever{H4479} he will{H6634}{(H8748)}."
Daniel,4,33,"The same hour{H8160} was the thing{H4406} fulfilled{H5487}{(H8754)} upon{H5922} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020}: and he was driven{H2957}{(H8752)} from{H4481} men{H606}, and did eat{H399}{(H8748)} grass{H6211} as oxen{H8450}, and his body{H1655} was wet{H6647}{(H8721)} with the dew{H2920} of heaven{H8065}, till{H5705} his hairs{H8177} were grown{H7236}{(H8754)} like eagles{H5403}' feathers, and his nails{H2953} like birds{H6853}' claws."
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end{H7118} of the days{H3118} I{H576} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} lifted up{H5191}{(H8754)} mine eyes{H5870} unto heaven{H8065}, and mine understanding{H4486} returned{H8421}{(H8748)} unto me{H5922}, and I blessed{H1289}{(H8745)} the most High{H5943}, and I praised{H7624}{(H8745)} and honoured{H1922}{(H8745)} him that liveth{H2417} for ever{H5957}, whose dominion{H7985} is an everlasting{H5957} dominion{H7985}, and his kingdom{H4437} is from{H5974} generation{H1859} to generation{H1859}:"
Daniel,4,35,"And all{H3606} the inhabitants{H1753}{(H8748)} of the earth{H772} are reputed{H2804}{(H8752)} as nothing{H3809}: and he doeth{H5648}{(H8751)} according to his will{H6634}{(H8749)} in the army{H2429} of heaven{H8065}, and among the inhabitants{H1753}{(H8748)} of the earth{H772}: and none{H3809} can{H383} stay{H4223}{(H8741)} his hand{H3028}, or say{H560}{(H8748)} unto him, What{H4101} doest{H5648}{(H8754)} thou?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time{H2166} my reason{H4486} returned{H8421}{(H8748)} unto me{H5922}; and for the glory{H3367} of my kingdom{H4437}, mine honour{H1923} and brightness{H2122} returned{H8421}{(H8748)} unto me{H5922}; and my counsellors{H1907} and my lords{H7261} sought{H1156}{(H8748)} unto me{H5922}; and I was established{H8627}{(H8717)} in my kingdom{H4437}, and excellent{H3493} majesty{H7238} was added{H3255}{(H8717)} unto me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now{H3705} I{H576} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} praise{H7624}{(H8743)} and extol{H7313}{(H8751)} and honour{H1922}{(H8743)} the King{H4430} of heaven{H8065}, all{H3606} whose works{H4567} are truth{H7187}, and his ways{H735} judgment{H1780}: and those that walk{H1981}{(H8683)} in pride{H1467} he is able{H3202}{(H8750)} to abase{H8214}{(H8682)}."
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar{H1113} the king{H4430} made{H5648}{(H8754)} a great{H7229} feast{H3900} to a thousand{H506} of his lords{H7261}, and drank{H8355}{(H8750)} wine{H2562} before{H6903} the thousand{H506}."
Daniel,5,2,"Belshazzar{H1113}, whiles he tasted{H2942} the wine{H2562}, commanded{H560}{(H8754)} to bring{H858}{(H8682)} the golden{H1722} and silver{H3702} vessels{H3984} which his father{H2} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} had taken{H5312}{(H8684)} out of{H4481} the temple{H1965} which was in Jerusalem{H3390}; that the king{H4430}, and his princes{H7261}, his wives{H7695}, and his concubines{H3904}, might drink{H8355}{(H8748)} therein."
Daniel,5,3,"Then{H116} they brought{H858}{(H8684)} the golden{H1722} vessels{H3984} that were taken{H5312}{(H8684)} out of{H4481} the temple{H1965} of the house{H1005} of God{H426} which was at Jerusalem{H3390}; and the king{H4430}, and his princes{H7261}, his wives{H7695}, and his concubines{H3904}, drank{H8355}{(H8754)} in them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank{H8355}{(H8754)} wine{H2562}, and praised{H7624}{(H8745)} the gods{H426} of gold{H1722}, and of silver{H3702}, of brass{H5174}, of iron{H6523}, of wood{H636}, and of stone{H69}."
Daniel,5,5,"In the same hour{H8160} came forth{H5312}{(H8754)} fingers{H677} of a man's{H606} hand{H3028}, and wrote{H3790}{(H8751)} over against{H6903} the candlestick{H5043} upon{H5922} the plaister{H1528} of the wall{H3797} of the king's{H4430} palace{H1965}: and the king{H4430} saw{H2370}{(H8751)} the part{H6447} of the hand{H3028} that wrote{H3790}{(H8751)}."
Daniel,5,6,"Then{H116} the king's{H4430} countenance{H2122} was changed{H8133}{(H8754)}, and his thoughts{H7476} troubled{H927}{(H8792)} him, so that the joints{H7001} of his loins{H2783} were loosed{H8271}{(H8723)}, and his knees{H755} smote{H5368}{(H8750)} one{H1668} against another{H1668}."
Daniel,5,7,"The king{H4430} cried{H7123}{(H8748)} aloud{H2429} to bring{H5954}{(H8682)} in the astrologers{H826}, the Chaldeans{H3779}, and the soothsayers{H1505}{(H8750)}. And the king{H4430} spake{H6032}{(H8750)}, and said{H560}{(H8750)} to the wise{H2445} men of Babylon{H895}, Whosoever{H606}{H3606} shall read{H7123}{(H8751)} this{H1836} writing{H3792}, and shew{H2324}{(H8741)} me the interpretation{H6591} thereof, shall be clothed{H3848}{(H8748)} with scarlet{H711}, and have a chain{H2002} of gold{H1722} about{H5922} his neck{H6676}, and shall be the third{H8523} ruler{H7981}{(H8748)} in the kingdom{H4437}."
Daniel,5,8,"Then{H116} came{H5954}{(H8750)} in all{H3606} the king's{H4430} wise{H2445} men: but they could{H3546}{(H8751)} not{H3809} read{H7123}{(H8749)} the writing{H3792}, nor make known{H3046}{(H8682)} to the king{H4430} the interpretation{H6591} thereof."
Daniel,5,9,"Then{H116} was king{H4430} Belshazzar{H1113} greatly{H7690} troubled{H927}{(H8727)}, and his countenance{H2122} was changed{H8133}{(H8750)} in him{H5922}, and his lords{H7261} were astonied{H7672}{(H8723)}."
Daniel,5,10,"Now the queen{H4433}, by reason{H6903} of the words{H4406} of the king{H4430} and his lords{H7261}, came{H5954}{(H8754)} into the banquet{H4961} house{H1005}: and the queen{H4433} spake{H6032}{(H8754)} and said{H560}{(H8754)}, O king{H4430}, live{H2418}{(H8747)} for ever{H5957}: let not{H409} thy thoughts{H7476} trouble{H927}{(H8792)} thee, nor let thy countenance{H2122} be changed{H8133}{(H8721)}:"
Daniel,5,11,"There is{H383} a man{H1400} in thy kingdom{H4437}, in whom is the spirit{H7308} of the holy{H6922} gods{H426}; and in the days{H3118} of thy father{H2} light{H5094} and understanding{H7924} and wisdom{H2452}, like the wisdom{H2452} of the gods{H426}, was found{H7912}{(H8728)} in him; whom the king{H4430} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} thy father{H2}, the king{H4430}, I say, thy father{H2}, made{H6966}{(H8684)} master{H7229} of the magicians{H2749}, astrologers{H826}, Chaldeans{H3779}, and soothsayers{H1505}{(H8750)};"
Daniel,5,12,"Forasmuch as{H6903}{H3606} an excellent{H3493} spirit{H7308}, and knowledge{H4486}, and understanding{H7924}, interpreting{H6590}{(H8743)} of dreams{H2493}, and shewing{H263} of hard sentences{H280}, and dissolving{H8271}{(H8743)} of doubts{H7001}, were found{H7912}{(H8728)} in the same Daniel{H1841}, whom the king{H4430} named{H7761}{(H8754)}{H8036} Belteshazzar{H1096}: now{H3705} let Daniel{H1841} be called{H7123}{(H8729)}, and he will shew{H2324}{(H8681)} the interpretation{H6591}."
Daniel,5,13,"Then{H116} was Daniel{H1841} brought in{H5954}{(H8717)} before{H6925} the king{H4430}. And the king{H4430} spake{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} unto Daniel{H1841}, Art thou{H607} that Daniel{H1841}, which art of{H4481} the children{H1123} of the captivity{H1547} of Judah{H3061}, whom the king{H4430} my father{H2} brought{H858}{(H8684)} out of{H4481} Jewry{H3061}?"
Daniel,5,14,"I have even heard{H8086}{(H8754)} of thee, that the spirit{H7308} of the gods{H426} is in thee{H5922}, and that light{H5094} and understanding{H7924} and excellent{H3493} wisdom{H2452} is found{H7912}{(H8728)} in thee."
Daniel,5,15,"And now{H3705} the wise{H2445} men, the astrologers{H826}, have been brought{H5954}{(H8717)} in before{H6925} me, that they should read{H7123}{(H8748)} this{H1836} writing{H3792}, and make known{H3046}{(H8682)} unto me the interpretation{H6591} thereof: but they could{H3546}{(H8751)} not{H3809} shew{H2324}{(H8682)} the interpretation{H6591} of the thing{H4406}:"
Daniel,5,16,"And I{H576} have heard{H8086}{(H8754)} of thee{H5922}, that thou canst{H3202}{(H8748)} make{H6590}{(H8749)} interpretations{H6591}, and dissolve{H8271}{(H8749)} doubts{H7001}: now{H3705} if{H2006} thou canst{H3202}{(H8748)} read{H7123}{(H8749)} the writing{H3792}, and make known{H3046}{(H8682)} to me the interpretation{H6591} thereof, thou shalt be clothed{H3848}{(H8748)} with scarlet{H711}, and have a chain{H2002} of gold{H1722} about{H5922} thy neck{H6676}, and shalt be the third{H8531} ruler{H7981}{(H8748)} in the kingdom{H4437}."
Daniel,5,17,"Then{H116} Daniel{H1841} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} before{H6925} the king{H4430}, Let thy gifts{H4978} be{H1934}{(H8748)} to thyself, and give{H3052}{(H8747)} thy rewards{H5023} to another{H321}; yet{H1297} I will read{H7123}{(H8748)} the writing{H3792} unto the king{H4430}, and make known{H3046}{(H8681)} to him the interpretation{H6591}."
Daniel,5,18,"O thou{H607} king{H4430}, the most high{H5943} God{H426} gave{H3052}{(H8754)} Nebuchadnezzar{H5020} thy father{H2} a kingdom{H4437}, and majesty{H7238}, and glory{H3367}, and honour{H1923}:"
Daniel,5,19,"And for{H4481} the majesty{H7238} that he gave{H3052}{(H8754)} him, all{H3606} people{H5972}, nations{H524}, and languages{H3961}, trembled{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2112} and feared{H1763}{(H8751)} before{H4481} him{H6925}: whom he would{H1934}{(H8754)}{H6634}{(H8750)} he slew{H1934}{(H8754)}{H6992}{(H8751)}; and whom he would{H1934}{(H8754)}{H6634}{(H8750)} he kept alive{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2418}{(H8683)}; and whom he would{H1934}{(H8754)}{H6634}{(H8750)} he set up{H1934}{(H8754)}{H7313}{(H8683)}; and whom he would{H1934}{(H8754)}{H6634}{(H8750)} he put down{H1934}{(H8754)}{H8214}{(H8683)}."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart{H3825} was lifted up{H7313}{(H8752)}, and his mind{H7308} hardened{H8631}{(H8748)} in pride{H2103}{(H8682)}, he was deposed{H5182}{(H8717)} from{H4481} his kingly{H4437} throne{H3764}, and they took{H5709}{(H8684)} his glory{H3367} from him{H4481}:"
Daniel,5,21,"And he was driven{H2957}{(H8752)} from{H4481} the sons{H1123} of men{H606}; and his heart{H3825} was made{H7739}{(H8745)} like{H5974} the beasts{H2423}, and his dwelling{H4070} was with the wild asses{H6167}: they fed{H2939}{(H8748)} him with grass{H6211} like oxen{H8450}, and his body{H1655} was wet{H6647}{(H8721)} with the dew{H2920} of heaven{H8065}; till{H5705} he knew{H3046}{(H8754)} that the most high{H5943} God{H426} ruled{H7990} in the kingdom{H4437} of men{H606}, and that he appointeth{H6966}{(H8681)} over{H5922} it whomsoever{H4479} he will{H6634}{(H8748)}."
Daniel,5,22,"And thou{H607} his son{H1247}, O Belshazzar{H1113}, hast not{H3809} humbled{H8214}{(H8684)} thine heart{H3825}, though{H6903} thou knewest{H3046}{(H8754)} all{H3606} this{H1836};"
Daniel,5,23,"But hast lifted up{H7313}{(H8712)} thyself against{H5922} the Lord{H4756} of heaven{H8065}; and they have brought{H858}{(H8684)} the vessels{H3984} of his house{H1005} before{H6925} thee, and thou{H607}, and thy lords{H7261}, thy wives{H7695}, and thy concubines{H3904}, have drunk{H8355}{(H8750)} wine{H2562} in them; and thou hast praised{H7624}{(H8745)} the gods{H426} of silver{H3702}, and gold{H1722}, of brass{H5174}, iron{H6523}, wood{H636}, and stone{H69}, which see{H2370}{(H8751)} not{H3809}, nor{H3809} hear{H8086}{(H8750)}, nor{H3809} know{H3046}{(H8751)}: and the God{H426} in whose hand{H3028} thy breath{H5396} is, and whose are all{H3606} thy ways{H735}, hast thou not{H3809} glorified{H1922}{(H8745)}:"
Daniel,5,24,Then{H116} was the part{H6447} of the hand{H3028} sent{H7972}{(H8750)} from{H4481} him{H6925}; and this{H1836} writing{H3792} was written{H7560}{(H8752)}.
Daniel,5,25,"And this{H1836} is the writing{H3792} that was written{H7560}{(H8752)}, MENE{H4484}{(H8752)}, MENE{H4484}{(H8752)}, TEKEL{H8625}{(H8752)}, UPHARSIN{H6537}{(H8751)}."
Daniel,5,26,"This{H1836} is the interpretation{H6591} of the thing{H4406}: MENE{H4484}{(H8752)}; God{H426} hath numbered{H4483}{(H8754)} thy kingdom{H4437}, and finished{H8000}{(H8684)} it."
Daniel,5,27,"TEKEL{H8625}{(H8752)}; Thou art weighed{H8625}{(H8760)} in the balances{H3977}, and art found{H7912}{(H8728)} wanting{H2627}."
Daniel,5,28,"PERES{H6537}{(H8752)}; Thy kingdom{H4437} is divided{H6537}{(H8752)}, and given{H3052}{(H8753)} to the Medes{H4076} and Persians{H6540}."
Daniel,5,29,"Then{H116} commanded{H560}{(H8754)} Belshazzar{H1113}, and they clothed{H3848}{(H8684)} Daniel{H1841} with scarlet{H711}, and put a chain{H2002} of gold{H1722} about{H5922} his neck{H6676}, and made a proclamation{H3745}{(H8684)} concerning{H5922} him, that he should be{H1934}{(H8748)} the third{H8531} ruler{H7990} in the kingdom{H4437}."
Daniel,5,30,In that night{H3916} was Belshazzar{H1113} the king{H4430} of the Chaldeans{H3779} slain{H6992}{(H8752)}.
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius{H1868} the Median{H4077} took{H6902}{(H8745)} the kingdom{H4437}, being about threescore{H8361} and two{H8648} years{H8140} old{H1247}."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased{H6925}{H8232}{(H8754)} Darius{H1868} to set{H6966}{(H8684)} over{H5922} the kingdom{H4437} an hundred{H3969} and twenty{H6243} princes{H324}, which should be{H1934}{(H8748)} over the whole{H3606} kingdom{H4437};"
Daniel,6,2,"And over{H5924} these{H4481} three{H8532} presidents{H5632}; of whom{H4481} Daniel{H1841} was first{H2298}: that{H459} the princes{H324} might{H1934}{(H8748)} give{H3052}{(H8751)} accounts{H2941} unto them, and the king{H4430} should have{H1934}{(H8748)} no{H3809} damage{H5142}{(H8752)}."
Daniel,6,3,"Then{H116} this{H1836} Daniel{H1841} was{H1934}{(H8754)} preferred{H5330}{(H8723)} above{H5922} the presidents{H5632} and princes{H324}, because{H3606}{H6903} an excellent{H3493} spirit{H7308} was in him; and the king{H4430} thought{H6246}{(H8754)} to set{H6966}{(H8682)} him over{H5922} the whole{H3606} realm{H4437}."
Daniel,6,4,"Then{H116} the presidents{H5632} and princes{H324} sought{H1934}{(H8754)}{H1156}{(H8750)} to find{H7912}{(H8682)} occasion{H5931} against Daniel{H1841} concerning{H6655} the kingdom{H4437}; but{H3606} they could{H3202}{(H8750)} find{H7912}{(H8682)} none{H3809} occasion{H5931} nor{H3809} fault{H7844}{(H8752)}; forasmuch{H6903} as he was faithful{H540}{(H8683)}, neither{H3809} was there any{H3606} error{H7960} or fault{H7844}{(H8752)} found{H7912}{(H8728)} in him{H5922}."
Daniel,6,5,"Then{H116} said{H560}{(H8750)} these{H479} men{H1400}, We shall not{H3809} find{H7912}{(H8684)} any{H3606} occasion{H5931} against{H5922} this{H1836} Daniel{H1841}, except{H3861} we find{H7912}{(H8681)} it against him concerning the law{H1882} of his God{H426}."
Daniel,6,6,"Then{H116} these{H459} presidents{H5632} and princes{H324} assembled together{H7284}{(H8684)} to the king{H4430}, and said{H560}{(H8750)} thus{H3652} unto him{H5922}, King{H4430} Darius{H1868}, live{H2418}{(H8747)} for ever{H5957}."
Daniel,6,7,"All{H3606} the presidents{H5632} of the kingdom{H4437}, the governors{H5460}, and the princes{H324}, the counsellors{H1907}, and the captains{H6347}, have consulted together{H3272}{(H8724)} to establish{H6966}{(H8742)} a royal{H4430} statute{H7010}, and to make a firm{H8631}{(H8742)} decree{H633}, that whosoever shall ask{H1156}{(H8748)} a petition{H1159} of{H4481} any{H3606} God{H426} or man{H606} for{H5705} thirty{H8533} days{H3118}, save{H3861} of thee{H4481}, O king{H4430}, he shall be cast{H7412}{(H8729)} into the den{H1358} of lions{H744}."
Daniel,6,8,"Now{H3705}, O king{H4430}, establish{H6966}{(H8681)} the decree{H633}, and sign{H7560}{(H8748)} the writing{H3792}, that it be not{H3809} changed{H8133}{(H8682)}, according to the law{H1882} of the Medes{H4076} and Persians{H6540}, which altereth{H5709}{(H8748)} not{H3809}."
Daniel,6,9,Wherefore{H3606}{H1836}{H6903} king{H4430} Darius{H1868} signed{H7560}{(H8754)} the writing{H3792} and the decree{H633}.
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Daniel{H1841} knew{H3046}{(H8754)} that the writing{H3792} was signed{H7560}{(H8752)}, he went{H5954}{(H8754)} into his house{H1005}; and his windows{H3551} being open{H6606}{(H8759)} in his chamber{H5952} toward{H5049} Jerusalem{H3390}, he kneeled{H1289}{(H8750)} upon{H5922} his knees{H1291} three{H8532} times{H2166} a day{H3118}, and prayed{H6739}{(H8743)}, and gave thanks{H3029}{(H8683)} before{H6925} his God{H426}, as{H6903}{H3606} he did{H1934}{(H8754)}{H5648}{(H8751)} aforetime{H4481}{H1836}{H6928}."
Daniel,6,11,"Then{H116} these{H479} men{H1400} assembled{H7284}{(H8684)}, and found{H7912}{(H8684)} Daniel{H1841} praying{H1156}{(H8750)} and making supplication{H2604}{(H8723)} before{H6925} his God{H426}."
Daniel,6,12,"Then{H116} they came near{H7127}{(H8754)}, and spake{H560}{(H8750)} before{H6925} the king{H4430} concerning{H5922} the king's{H4430} decree{H633}; Hast thou not{H3809} signed{H7560}{(H8754)} a decree{H633}, that every{H3606} man{H606} that shall ask{H1156}{(H8748)} a petition of{H4481} any{H3606} God{H426} or man{H606} within{H5705} thirty{H8533} days{H3118}, save{H3861} of thee{H4481}, O king{H4430}, shall be cast{H7412}{(H8729)} into the den{H1358} of lions{H744}? The king{H4430} answered{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, The thing{H4406} is true{H3330}, according to the law{H1882} of the Medes{H4076} and Persians{H6540}, which altereth{H5709}{(H8748)} not{H3809}."
Daniel,6,13,"Then{H116} answered{H6032}{(H8754)} they and said{H560}{(H8750)} before{H6925} the king{H4430}, That Daniel{H1841}, which is of{H4481} the children{H1123} of the captivity{H1547} of Judah{H3061}, regardeth{H7761}{(H8754)}{H2942} not{H3809} thee{H5922}, O king{H4430}, nor the decree{H633} that thou hast signed{H7560}{(H8754)}, but maketh{H1156}{(H8750)} his petition{H1159} three{H8532} times{H2166} a day{H3118}."
Daniel,6,14,"Then{H116} the king{H4430}, when he heard{H8086}{(H8754)} these words{H4406}, was sore{H7690} displeased{H888}{(H8754)} with himself, and set{H7761}{(H8754)} his heart{H1079} on{H5922} Daniel{H1841} to deliver{H7804}{(H8756)} him: and he laboured{H1934}{(H8754)}{H7712}{(H8723)} till{H5705} the going down{H4606} of the sun{H8122} to deliver{H5338}{(H8682)} him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then{H116} these{H479} men{H1400} assembled{H7284}{(H8684)} unto{H5922} the king{H4430}, and said{H560}{(H8750)} unto the king{H4430}, Know{H3046}{(H8747)}, O king{H4430}, that the law{H1882} of the Medes{H4076} and Persians{H6540} is, That no{H3606} decree{H633} nor statute{H7010} which the king{H4430} establisheth{H6966}{(H8681)} may be changed{H8133}{(H8682)}."
Daniel,6,16,"Then{H116} the king{H4430} commanded{H560}{(H8754)}, and they brought{H858}{(H8684)} Daniel{H1841}, and cast{H7412}{(H8754)} him into the den{H1358} of lions{H744}. Now the king{H4430} spake{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} unto Daniel{H1841}, Thy God{H426} whom thou{H607} servest{H6399}{(H8750)} continually{H8411}, he will deliver{H7804}{(H8755)} thee."
Daniel,6,17,"And a{H2298} stone{H69} was brought{H858}{(H8717)}, and laid{H7761}{(H8752)} upon{H5922} the mouth{H6433} of the den{H1358}; and the king{H4430} sealed{H2857}{(H8754)} it with his own signet{H5824}, and with the signet{H5824} of his lords{H7261}; that the purpose{H6640} might not{H3809} be changed{H8133}{(H8748)} concerning Daniel{H1841}."
Daniel,6,18,"Then{H116} the king{H4430} went{H236}{(H8754)} to his palace{H1965}, and passed the night{H956}{(H8754)} fasting{H2908}: neither{H3809} were instruments{H1761} of musick brought{H5954}{(H8684)} before{H6925} him: and his sleep{H8139} went{H5075}{(H8754)} from him{H5922}."
Daniel,6,19,"Then{H116} the king{H4430} arose{H6966}{(H8748)} very early{H8238} in the morning{H5053}, and went{H236}{(H8754)} in haste{H927}{(H8726)} unto the den{H1358} of lions{H744}."
Daniel,6,20,"And when he came{H7127}{(H8749)} to the den{H1358}, he cried{H2200}{(H8754)} with a lamentable{H6088}{(H8750)} voice{H7032} unto Daniel{H1841}: and the king{H4430} spake{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)} to Daniel{H1841}, O Daniel{H1841}, servant{H5649} of the living{H2417} God{H426}, is thy God{H426}, whom thou servest{H6399}{(H8750)} continually{H8411}, able{H3202}{(H8754)} to deliver{H7804}{(H8756)} thee from{H4481} the lions{H744}?"
Daniel,6,21,"Then{H116} said{H4449}{(H8745)} Daniel{H1841} unto{H5974} the king{H4430}, O king{H4430}, live{H2418}{(H8747)} for ever{H5957}."
Daniel,6,22,"My God{H426} hath sent{H7972}{(H8754)} his angel{H4398}, and hath shut{H5463}{(H8754)} the lions{H744}' mouths{H6433}, that they have not{H3809} hurt{H2255}{(H8745)} me: forasmuch as{H3606}{H6903} before{H6925} him innocency{H2136} was found{H7912}{(H8728)} in me; and also{H638} before{H6925} thee, O king{H4430}, have I done{H5648}{(H8754)} no{H3809} hurt{H2248}."
Daniel,6,23,"Then{H116} was the king{H4430} exceeding{H7690} glad{H2868}{(H8754)} for him{H5922}, and commanded{H560}{(H8754)} that they should take{H5267} Daniel{H1841} up{H5267}{(H8682)} out of{H4481} the den{H1358}. So Daniel{H1841} was taken up{H5267}{(H8717)} out of{H4481} the den{H1358}, and no{H3809} manner{H3606} of hurt{H2257} was found{H7912}{(H8728)} upon him, because he believed{H540}{(H8684)} in his God{H426}."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king{H4430} commanded{H560}{(H8754)}, and they brought{H858}{(H8684)} those{H479} men{H1400} which had accused{H399}{(H8754)}{H7170} Daniel{H1841}, and they cast{H7412}{(H8754)} them into the den{H1358} of lions{H744}, them{H581}, their children{H1123}, and their wives{H5389}; and the lions{H744} had the mastery{H5705}{H7981}{(H8754)} of them, and brake{H1855} all{H3606} their bones{H1635} in pieces{H1855}{(H8684)} or ever{H3809} they came{H4291}{(H8754)} at the bottom{H773} of the den{H1358}."
Daniel,6,25,"Then{H116} king{H4430} Darius{H1868} wrote{H3790}{(H8754)} unto all{H3606} people{H5972}, nations{H524}, and languages{H3961}, that dwell{H1753}{(H8748)} in all{H3606} the earth{H772}; Peace{H8001} be multiplied{H7680}{(H8748)} unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"I{H4481}{H6925} make{H7761}{(H8752)} a decree{H2942}, That in every{H3606} dominion{H7985} of my kingdom{H4437} men tremble{H1934}{(H8748)}{H2112} and fear{H1763}{(H8751)} before{H4481}{H6925} the God{H426} of Daniel{H1841}: for he is the living{H2417} God{H426}, and stedfast{H7011} for ever{H5957}, and his kingdom{H4437} that which shall not{H3809} be destroyed{H2255}{(H8721)}, and his dominion{H7985} shall be even unto{H5705} the end{H5491}."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivereth{H7804}{(H8757)} and rescueth{H5338}{(H8683)}, and he worketh{H5648}{(H8751)} signs{H852} and wonders{H8540} in heaven{H8065} and in earth{H772}, who hath delivered{H7804}{(H8758)} Daniel{H1841} from{H4481} the power{H3028} of the lions{H744}."
Daniel,6,28,"So this{H1836} Daniel{H1841} prospered{H6744}{(H8684)} in the reign{H4437} of Darius{H1868}, and in the reign{H4437} of Cyrus{H3567} the Persian{H6543}."
Daniel,7,1,"In the first{H2298} year{H8140} of Belshazzar{H1113} king{H4430} of Babylon{H895} Daniel{H1841} had{H2370}{(H8754)} a dream{H2493} and visions{H2376} of his head{H7217} upon{H5922} his bed{H4903}: then{H116} he wrote{H3790}{(H8754)} the dream{H2493}, and told{H560}{(H8754)} the sum{H7217} of the matters{H4406}."
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel{H1841} spake{H6032}{(H8750)} and said{H560}{(H8750)}, I saw{H2370}{(H8751)}{H1934}{(H8754)} in my vision{H2376} by{H5974} night{H3916}, and, behold{H718}, the four{H703} winds{H7308} of the heaven{H8065} strove{H1519}{(H8683)} upon the great{H7229} sea{H3221}."
Daniel,7,3,"And four{H703} great{H7260} beasts{H2423} came up{H5559}{(H8751)} from{H4481} the sea{H3221}, diverse{H8133}{(H8750)} one{H1668} from{H4481} another{H1668}."
Daniel,7,4,"The first{H6933} was like a lion{H744}, and had eagle's{H5403} wings{H1611}: I beheld{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} till{H5705} the wings{H1611} thereof were plucked{H4804}{(H8760)}, and it was lifted up{H5191}{(H8760)} from{H4481} the earth{H772}, and made stand{H6966}{(H8717)} upon{H5922} the feet{H7271} as a man{H606}, and a man's{H606} heart{H3825} was given{H3052}{(H8753)} to it."
Daniel,7,5,"And behold{H718} another{H317} beast{H2423}, a second{H8578}, like{H1821}{(H8751)} to a bear{H1678}, and it raised up{H6966}{(H8684)} itself on one{H2298} side{H7859}, and it had three{H8532} ribs{H5967} in the mouth{H6433} of it between{H997} the teeth{H8128} of it: and they said{H560}{(H8750)} thus{H3652} unto it, Arise{H6966}{(H8747)}, devour{H399}{(H8747)} much{H7690} flesh{H1321}."
Daniel,7,6,"After{H870} this{H1836} I beheld{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)}, and lo{H718} another{H317}, like a leopard{H5245}, which had upon{H5922} the back{H1355} of it four{H703} wings{H1611} of a fowl{H5776}; the beast{H2423} had also four{H703} heads{H7217}; and dominion{H7985} was given{H3052}{(H8753)} to it."
Daniel,7,7,"After{H870} this{H1836} I saw{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} in the night{H3916} visions{H2376}, and behold{H718} a fourth{H7244} beast{H2423}, dreadful{H1763}{(H8753)} and terrible{H574}, and strong{H8624} exceedingly{H3493}; and it had great{H7260} iron{H6523} teeth{H8128}: it devoured{H399}{(H8750)} and brake in pieces{H1855}{(H8683)}, and stamped{H7512}{(H8751)} the residue{H7606} with the feet{H7271} of it: and it{H1932} was diverse{H8133}{(H8743)} from{H4481} all{H3606} the beasts{H2423} that were before{H6925} it; and it had ten{H6236} horns{H7162}."
Daniel,7,8,"I considered{H1934}{(H8754)}{H7920}{(H8723)} the horns{H7162}, and, behold{H431}, there came up{H5559}{(H8754)} among{H997} them another{H317} little{H2192} horn{H7162}, before{H6925}{H4481} whom there were three{H8532} of{H4481} the first{H6933} horns{H7162} plucked up by the roots{H6132}{(H8725)}: and, behold{H431}, in this{H1668} horn{H7162} were eyes{H5870} like the eyes{H5870} of man{H606}, and a mouth{H6433} speaking{H4449}{(H8743)} great things{H7260}."
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} till{H5705} the thrones{H3764} were cast down{H7412}{(H8752)}, and the Ancient{H6268} of days{H3118} did sit{H3488}{(H8754)}, whose garment{H3831} was white{H2358} as snow{H8517}, and the hair{H8177} of his head{H7217} like the pure{H5343} wool{H6015}: his throne{H3764} was like the fiery{H5135} flame{H7631}, and his wheels{H1535} as burning{H1815}{(H8751)} fire{H5135}."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery{H5135} stream{H5103} issued{H5047}{(H8743)} and came forth{H5312}{(H8750)} from{H4481} before{H6925} him: thousand{H506} thousands{H506} ministered{H8120}{(H8741)} unto him, and ten thousand{H7240} times ten thousand{H7240} stood{H6966}{(H8748)} before{H6925} him: the judgment{H1780} was set{H3488}{(H8754)}, and the books{H5609} were opened{H6606}{(H8760)}."
Daniel,7,11,"I beheld{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} then{H116} because{H4481} of the voice{H7032} of the great{H7260} words{H4406} which the horn{H7162} spake{H4449}{(H8743)}: I beheld{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} even till{H5705} the beast{H2423} was slain{H6992}{(H8752)}, and his body{H1655} destroyed{H7}{(H8717)}, and given{H3052}{(H8753)} to the burning{H3346} flame{H785}."
Daniel,7,12,"As concerning the rest{H7606} of the beasts{H2423}, they had their dominion{H7985} taken away{H5709}{(H8684)}: yet their lives{H2417} were prolonged{H3052}{(H8753)} for{H5705} a season{H2166} and time{H5732}."
Daniel,7,13,"I saw{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)} in the night{H3916} visions{H2376}, and, behold{H718}, one like the Son{H1247} of man{H606} came{H858}{(H8750)} with{H5974} the clouds{H6050} of heaven{H8065}, and came{H4291}{(H8754)} to{H5705} the Ancient{H6268} of days{H3118}, and they brought him near{H7127}{(H8684)} before{H6925} him."
Daniel,7,14,"And there was given{H3052}{(H8753)} him dominion{H7985}, and glory{H3367}, and a kingdom{H4437}, that all{H3606} people{H5972}, nations{H524}, and languages{H3961}, should serve{H6399}{(H8748)} him: his dominion{H7985} is an everlasting{H5957} dominion{H7985}, which shall not{H3809} pass away{H5709}{(H8748)}, and his kingdom{H4437} that which shall not{H3809} be destroyed{H2255}{(H8721)}."
Daniel,7,15,"I{H576} Daniel{H1841} was grieved{H3735}{(H8730)} in my spirit{H7308} in the midst{H1459} of my body{H5085}, and the visions{H2376} of my head{H7217} troubled{H927}{(H8792)} me."
Daniel,7,16,"I came near{H7127}{(H8754)} unto{H5922} one{H2298} of{H4481} them that stood by{H6966}{(H8750)}, and asked{H1156}{(H8748)} him{H4481} the truth{H3330} of all{H3606} this{H1836}. So he told{H560}{(H8754)} me, and made me know{H3046}{(H8681)} the interpretation{H6591} of the things{H4406}."
Daniel,7,17,"These{H459} great{H7260} beasts{H2423}, which{H581} are four{H703}, are four{H703} kings{H4430}, which shall arise{H6966}{(H8748)} out of{H4481} the earth{H772}."
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints{H6922} of the most High{H5946} shall take{H6902}{(H8741)} the kingdom{H4437}, and possess{H2631}{(H8681)} the kingdom{H4437} for{H5705} ever{H5957}, even for{H5705} ever{H5957} and ever{H5957}."
Daniel,7,19,"Then{H116} I would{H6634}{(H8754)} know the truth{H3321}{(H8742)} of{H5922} the fourth{H7244} beast{H2423}, which was{H1934}{(H8754)} diverse{H8133}{(H8750)} from{H4481} all{H3606} the others, exceeding{H3493} dreadful{H1763}{(H8753)}, whose teeth{H8128} were of iron{H6523}, and his nails{H2953} of brass{H5174}; which devoured{H399}{(H8750)}, brake in pieces{H1855}{(H8683)}, and stamped{H7512}{(H8751)} the residue{H7606} with his feet{H7271};"
Daniel,7,20,"And of{H5922} the ten{H6236} horns{H7162} that were in his head{H7217}, and of the other{H317} which came up{H5559}{(H8754)}, and before{H4481}{H6925} whom three{H8532} fell{H5308}{(H8754)}; even of that horn{H7162} that{H1797} had eyes{H5870}, and a mouth{H6433} that spake{H4449}{(H8743)} very great things{H7260}, whose look{H2376} was more{H4481} stout{H7229} than{H4481} his fellows{H2273}."
Daniel,7,21,"I beheld{H1934}{(H8754)}{H2370}{(H8751)}, and the same{H1797} horn{H7162} made{H5648}{(H8751)} war{H7129} with{H5974} the saints{H6922}, and prevailed{H3202}{(H8750)} against them;"
Daniel,7,22,"Until{H5705} the Ancient{H6268} of days{H3118} came{H858}{(H8754)}{H1768}, and judgment{H1780} was given{H3052}{(H8753)} to the saints{H6922} of the most High{H5946}; and the time{H2166} came{H4291}{(H8754)} that the saints{H6922} possessed{H2631}{(H8684)} the kingdom{H4437}."
Daniel,7,23,"Thus{H3652} he said{H560}{(H8754)}, The fourth{H7244} beast{H2423} shall be{H1934}{(H8748)} the fourth{H7244} kingdom{H4437} upon earth{H772}, which shall be diverse{H8133}{(H8748)} from{H4481} all{H3606} kingdoms{H4437}, and shall devour{H399}{(H8748)} the whole{H3606} earth{H772}, and shall tread it down{H1759}{(H8748)}, and break it in pieces{H1855}{(H8681)}."
Daniel,7,24,"And the ten{H6236} horns{H7162} out of{H4481} this kingdom{H4437} are ten{H6236} kings{H4430} that shall arise{H6966}{(H8748)}: and another{H321} shall rise{H6966}{(H8748)} after{H311} them; and he shall be diverse{H8133}{(H8748)} from{H4481} the first{H6933}, and he shall subdue{H8214}{(H8681)} three{H8532} kings{H4430}."
Daniel,7,25,"And he shall speak{H4449}{(H8741)} great words{H4406} against{H6655} the most High{H5943}, and shall wear out{H1080}{(H8741)} the saints{H6922} of the most High{H5946}, and think{H5452}{(H8748)} to change{H8133}{(H8682)} times{H2166} and laws{H1882}: and they shall be given{H3052}{(H8725)} into his hand{H3028} until{H5705} a time{H5732} and times{H5732} and the dividing{H6387} of time{H5732}."
Daniel,7,26,"But the judgment{H1780} shall sit{H3488}{(H8754)}, and they shall take away{H5709}{(H8681)} his dominion{H7985}, to consume{H8046}{(H8682)} and to destroy{H7}{(H8682)} it unto{H5705} the end{H5491}."
Daniel,7,27,"And the kingdom{H4437} and dominion{H7985}, and the greatness{H7238} of the kingdom{H4437} under{H8460} the whole{H3606} heaven{H8065}, shall be given{H3052}{(H8753)} to the people{H5972} of the saints{H6922} of the most High{H5946}, whose kingdom{H4437} is an everlasting{H5957} kingdom{H4437}, and all{H3606} dominions{H7985} shall serve{H6399}{(H8748)} and obey{H8086}{(H8721)} him."
Daniel,7,28,"Hitherto{H5705}{H3542} is the end{H5491} of the matter{H4406}. As for me{H576} Daniel{H1841}, my cogitations{H7476} much{H7690} troubled{H927}{(H8792)} me, and my countenance{H2122} changed{H8133}{(H8721)} in me{H5922}: but I kept{H5202}{(H8754)} the matter{H4406} in my heart{H3821}."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third{H7969} year{H8141} of the reign{H4438} of king{H4428} Belshazzar{H1112} a vision{H2377} appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} unto me, even unto me Daniel{H1840}, after{H310} that which appeared{H7200}{(H8738)} unto me at the first{H8462}."
Daniel,8,2,"And I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} in a vision{H2377}; and it came to pass, when I saw{H7200}{(H8800)}, that I was at Shushan{H7800} in the palace{H1002}, which is in the province{H4082} of Elam{H5867}; and I saw{H7200}{(H8799)} in a vision{H2377}, and I was by the river{H180} of Ulai{H195}."
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted up{H5375}{(H8799)} mine eyes{H5869}, and saw{H7200}{(H8799)}, and, behold, there stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the river{H180} a{H259} ram{H352} which had two horns{H7161}: and the two horns{H7161} were high{H1364}; but one{H259} was higher{H1364} than the other{H8145}, and the higher{H1364} came up{H5927}{(H8802)} last{H314}."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} the ram{H352} pushing{H5055}{(H8764)} westward{H3220}, and northward{H6828}, and southward{H5045}; so that no beasts{H2416} might stand{H5975}{(H8799)} before{H6440} him, neither was there any that could deliver{H5337}{(H8688)} out of his hand{H3027}; but he did{H6213}{(H8804)} according to his will{H7522}, and became great{H1431}{(H8689)}."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering{H995}{(H8688)}, behold, an he{H5795} goat{H6842} came{H935}{(H8802)} from the west{H4628} on the face{H6440} of the whole earth{H776}, and touched{H5060}{(H8802)} not the ground{H776}: and the goat{H6842} had a notable{H2380} horn{H7161} between his eyes{H5869}."
Daniel,8,6,"And he came{H935}{(H8799)} to the ram{H352} that had{H1167} two horns{H7161}, which I had seen{H7200}{(H8804)} standing{H5975}{(H8802)} before{H6440} the river{H180}, and ran{H7323}{(H8799)} unto him in the fury{H2534} of his power{H3581}."
Daniel,8,7,"And I saw{H7200}{(H8804)} him come{H5060}{(H8688)} close unto{H681} the ram{H352}, and he was moved with choler{H4843}{(H8698)} against him, and smote{H5221}{(H8686)} the ram{H352}, and brake{H7665}{(H8762)} his two{H8147} horns{H7161}: and there was no power{H3581} in the ram{H352} to stand{H5975}{(H8800)} before{H6440} him, but he cast him down{H7993}{(H8686)} to the ground{H776}, and stamped{H7429}{(H8799)} upon him: and there was none that could deliver{H5337}{(H8688)} the ram{H352} out of his hand{H3027}."
Daniel,8,8,"Therefore the he{H6842} goat{H5795} waxed very{H3966} great{H1431}{(H8689)}: and when he was strong{H6105}{(H8800)}, the great{H1419} horn{H7161} was broken{H7665}{(H8738)}; and for it came up{H5927}{(H8799)} four{H702} notable ones{H2380} toward the four{H702} winds{H7307} of heaven{H8064}."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one{H259} of them came forth{H3318}{(H8804)} a little{H4704} horn{H7161}, which waxed exceeding{H3499} great{H1431}{(H8799)}, toward the south{H5045}, and toward the east{H4217}, and toward the pleasant{H6643} land."
Daniel,8,10,"And it waxed great{H1431}{(H8799)}, even to the host{H6635} of heaven{H8064}; and it cast down{H5307}{(H8686)} some of the host{H6635} and of the stars{H3556} to the ground{H776}, and stamped{H7429}{(H8799)} upon them."
Daniel,8,11,"Yea, he magnified{H1431}{(H8689)} himself even to the prince{H8269} of the host{H6635}, and by him the daily{H8548} sacrifice was taken away{H7311}{(H8717)}{(H8675)}{H7311}{(H8689)}, and the place{H4349} of his sanctuary{H4720} was cast down{H7993}{(H8717)}."
Daniel,8,12,"And an host{H6635} was given{H5414}{(H8735)} him against the daily{H8548} sacrifice by reason of transgression{H6588}, and it cast down{H7993}{(H8686)} the truth{H571} to the ground{H776}; and it practised{H6213}{(H8804)}, and prospered{H6743}{(H8689)}."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} one{H259} saint{H6918} speaking{H1696}{(H8764)}, and another{H259} saint{H6918} said{H559}{(H8799)} unto that certain{H6422} saint which spake{H1696}{(H8764)}, How long shall be the vision{H2377} concerning the daily{H8548} sacrifice, and the transgression{H6588} of desolation{H8074}{(H8802)}, to give{H5414}{(H8800)} both the sanctuary{H6944} and the host{H6635} to be trodden under foot{H4823}?"
Daniel,8,14,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Unto two thousand{H505} and three{H7969} hundred{H3967} days{H6153}{H1242}; then shall the sanctuary{H6944} be cleansed{H6663}{(H8738)}."
Daniel,8,15,"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel{H1840}, had seen{H7200}{(H8800)} the vision{H2377}, and sought{H1245}{(H8762)} for the meaning{H998}, then, behold, there stood{H5975}{(H8802)} before me as the appearance{H4758} of a man{H1397}."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard{H8085}{(H8799)} a man's{H120} voice{H6963} between the banks of Ulai{H195}, which called{H7121}{(H8799)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, Gabriel{H1403}, make this{H1975} man to understand{H995}{(H8685)} the vision{H4758}."
Daniel,8,17,"So he came{H935}{(H8799)} near{H681} where I stood{H5977}: and when he came{H935}{(H8800)}, I was afraid{H1204}{(H8738)}, and fell{H5307}{(H8799)} upon my face{H6440}: but he said{H559}{(H8799)} unto me, Understand{H995}{(H8685)}, O son{H1121} of man{H120}: for at the time{H6256} of the end{H7093} shall be the vision{H2377}."
Daniel,8,18,"Now as he was speaking{H1696}{(H8763)} with me, I was in a deep sleep{H7290}{(H8738)} on my face{H6440} toward the ground{H776}: but he touched{H5060}{(H8799)} me, and set{H5975}{(H8686)} me upright{H5977}."
Daniel,8,19,"And he said{H559}{(H8799)}, Behold, I will make thee know{H3045}{(H8688)} what shall be in the last end{H319} of the indignation{H2195}: for at the time appointed{H4150} the end{H7093} shall be."
Daniel,8,20,The ram{H352} which thou sawest{H7200}{(H8804)} having{H1167} two horns{H7161} are the kings{H4428} of Media{H4074} and Persia{H6539}.
Daniel,8,21,And the rough{H8163} goat{H6842} is the king{H4428} of Grecia{H3120}: and the great{H1419} horn{H7161} that is between his eyes{H5869} is the first{H7223} king{H4428}.
Daniel,8,22,"Now that being broken{H7665}{(H8737)}, whereas four{H702} stood up{H5975}{(H8799)} for it, four{H702} kingdoms{H4438} shall stand up{H5975}{(H8799)} out of the nation{H1471}, but not in his power{H3581}."
Daniel,8,23,"And in the latter time{H319} of their kingdom{H4438}, when the transgressors{H6586}{(H8802)} are come to the full{H8552}{(H8687)}, a king{H4428} of fierce{H5794} countenance{H6440}, and understanding{H995}{(H8688)} dark sentences{H2420}, shall stand up{H5975}{(H8799)}."
Daniel,8,24,"And his power{H3581} shall be mighty{H6105}{(H8804)}, but not by his own power{H3581}: and he shall destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} wonderfully{H6381}{(H8737)}, and shall prosper{H6743}{(H8689)}, and practise{H6213}{(H8804)}, and shall destroy{H7843}{(H8689)} the mighty{H6099} and the holy{H6918} people{H5971}."
Daniel,8,25,"And through his policy{H7922} also he shall cause craft{H4820} to prosper{H6743}{(H8689)} in his hand{H3027}; and he shall magnify{H1431}{(H8686)} himself in his heart{H3824}, and by peace{H7962} shall destroy{H7843}{(H8686)} many{H7227}: he shall also stand up{H5975}{(H8799)} against the Prince{H8269} of princes{H8269}; but he shall be broken{H7665}{(H8735)} without{H657} hand{H3027}."
Daniel,8,26,And the vision{H4758} of the evening{H6153} and the morning{H1242} which was told{H559}{(H8738)} is true{H571}: wherefore shut thou up{H5640}{(H8798)} the vision{H2377}; for it shall be for many{H7227} days{H3117}.
Daniel,8,27,"And I Daniel{H1840} fainted{H1961}{(H8738)}, and was sick{H2470}{(H8738)} certain days{H3117}; afterward I rose up{H6965}{(H8799)}, and did{H6213}{(H8799)} the king's{H4428} business{H4399}; and I was astonished{H8074}{(H8709)} at the vision{H4758}, but none understood{H995}{(H8688)} it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first{H259} year{H8141} of Darius{H1867} the son{H1121} of Ahasuerus{H325}, of the seed{H2233} of the Medes{H4074}, which was made king{H4427}{(H8717)} over the realm{H4438} of the Chaldeans{H3778};"
Daniel,9,2,"In the first{H259} year{H8141} of his reign{H4427}{(H8800)} I Daniel{H1840} understood{H995}{(H8804)} by books{H5612} the number{H4557} of the years{H8141}, whereof the word{H1697} of the LORD{H3068} came to Jeremiah{H3414} the prophet{H5030}, that he would accomplish{H4390}{(H8763)} seventy{H7657} years{H8141} in the desolations{H2723} of Jerusalem{H3389}."
Daniel,9,3,"And I set{H5414}{(H8799)} my face{H6440} unto the Lord{H136} God{H430}, to seek{H1245}{(H8763)} by prayer{H8605} and supplications{H8469}, with fasting{H6685}, and sackcloth{H8242}, and ashes{H665}:"
Daniel,9,4,"And I prayed{H6419}{(H8691)} unto the LORD{H3068} my God{H430}, and made my confession{H3034}{(H8691)}, and said{H559}{(H8799)}, O{H577} Lord{H136}, the great{H1419} and dreadful{H3372}{(H8737)} God{H410}, keeping{H8104}{(H8802)} the covenant{H1285} and mercy{H2617} to them that love{H157}{(H8802)} him, and to them that keep{H8104}{(H8802)} his commandments{H4687};"
Daniel,9,5,"We have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)}, and have committed iniquity{H5753}{(H8804)}, and have done wickedly{H7561}{(H8689)}, and have rebelled{H4775}{(H8804)}, even by departing{H5493}{(H8800)} from thy precepts{H4687} and from thy judgments{H4941}:"
Daniel,9,6,"Neither have we hearkened{H8085}{(H8804)} unto thy servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}, which spake{H1696}{(H8765)} in thy name{H8034} to our kings{H4428}, our princes{H8269}, and our fathers{H1}, and to all the people{H5971} of the land{H776}."
Daniel,9,7,"O Lord{H136}, righteousness{H6666} belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion{H1322} of faces{H6440}, as at this day{H3117}; to the men{H376} of Judah{H3063}, and to the inhabitants{H3427}{(H8802)} of Jerusalem{H3389}, and unto all Israel{H3478}, that are near{H7138}, and that are far off{H7350}, through all the countries{H776} whither thou hast driven{H5080}{(H8689)} them, because of their trespass{H4604} that they have trespassed{H4603}{(H8804)} against thee."
Daniel,9,8,"O Lord{H136}, to us belongeth confusion{H1322} of face{H6440}, to our kings{H4428}, to our princes{H8269}, and to our fathers{H1}, because we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against thee."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord{H136} our God{H430} belong mercies{H7356} and forgivenesses{H5547}, though we have rebelled{H4775}{(H8804)} against him;"
Daniel,9,10,"Neither have we obeyed{H8085}{(H8804)} the voice{H6963} of the LORD{H3068} our God{H430}, to walk{H3212}{(H8800)} in his laws{H8451}, which he set{H5414}{(H8804)} before{H6440} us by{H3027} his servants{H5650} the prophets{H5030}."
Daniel,9,11,"Yea, all Israel{H3478} have transgressed{H5674}{(H8804)} thy law{H8451}, even by departing{H5493}{(H8800)}, that they might not obey{H8085}{(H8800)} thy voice{H6963}; therefore the curse{H423} is poured{H5413}{(H8799)} upon us, and the oath{H7621} that is written{H3789}{(H8803)} in the law{H8451} of Moses{H4872} the servant{H5650} of God{H430}, because we have sinned{H2398}{(H8804)} against him."
