Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis,1,2,"Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters."
Genesis,1,3,"Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light."
Genesis,1,4,"God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness."
Genesis,1,5,"God called the light “day,” and He called the darkness “night.” Evening came and then morning: the first day."
Genesis,1,6,"Then God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water.”"
Genesis,1,7,So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse. And it was so.
Genesis,1,8,God called the expanse “sky.” Evening came and then morning: the second day.
Genesis,1,9,"Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,10,"God called the dry land “earth,” and He called the gathering of the water “seas.” And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"Then God said, “Let the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,12,The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
Genesis,1,13,Evening came and then morning: the third day.
Genesis,1,14,"Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night. They will serve as signs for festivals and for days and years."
Genesis,1,15,They will be lights in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth.” And it was so.
Genesis,1,16,God made the two great lights—the greater light to have dominion over the day and the lesser light to have dominion over the night—as well as the stars.
Genesis,1,17,"God placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"to dominate the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,19,Evening came and then morning: the fourth day.
Genesis,1,20,"Then God said, “Let the water swarm with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.”"
Genesis,1,21,"So God created the large sea-creatures and every living creature that moves and swarms in the water, according to their kinds. He also created every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,22,"So God blessed them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,23,Evening came and then morning: the fifth day.
Genesis,1,24,"Then God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, all the earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,27,So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God; He created them male and female.
Genesis,1,28,"God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,29,"God also said, “Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the surface of the entire earth and every tree whose fruit contains seed. This food will be for you,"
Genesis,1,30,"for all the wildlife of the earth, for every bird of the sky, and for every creature that crawls on the earth—everything having the breath of life in it. I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so."
Genesis,1,31,"God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. Evening came and then morning: the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,So the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.
Genesis,2,2,"By the seventh day God completed His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work that He had done."
Genesis,2,3,"God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, for on it He rested from His work of creation."
Genesis,2,4,"These are the records of the heavens and the earth, concerning their creation at the time that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens."
Genesis,2,5,"No shrub of the field had yet grown on the land, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not made it rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground."
Genesis,2,6,But water would come out of the ground and water the entire surface of the land.
Genesis,2,7,"Then the LORD God formed the man out of the dust from the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being."
Genesis,2,8,"The LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there He placed the man He had formed."
Genesis,2,9,"The LORD God caused to grow out of the ground every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden, as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,A river went out from Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became the source of four rivers.
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pishon, which flows through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold."
Genesis,2,12,Gold from that land is pure; bdellium and onyx are also there.
Genesis,2,13,"The name of the second river is Gihon, which flows through the entire land of Cush."
Genesis,2,14,"The name of the third river is the Tigris, which runs east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates."
Genesis,2,15,The LORD God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to work it and watch over it.
Genesis,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree of the garden,"
Genesis,2,17,"but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die.”"
Genesis,2,18,"Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper as his complement.”"
Genesis,2,19,"So the LORD God formed out of the ground every wild animal and every bird of the sky, and brought each to the man to see what he would call it. And whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name."
Genesis,2,20,"The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the sky, and to every wild animal; but for the man no helper was found as his complement."
Genesis,2,21,"So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to come over the man, and he slept. God took one of his ribs and closed the flesh at that place."
Genesis,2,22,Then the LORD God made the rib He had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man.
Genesis,2,23,"And the man said: This one, at last, is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; this one will be called “woman,” for she was taken from man."
Genesis,2,24,"This is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and they become one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,"Both the man and his wife were naked, yet felt no shame."
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You can’t eat from any tree in the garden’?”"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden."
Genesis,3,3,"But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.’”"
Genesis,3,4,"“No! You will not die,” the serpent said to the woman."
Genesis,3,5,"“In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”"
Genesis,3,6,"Then the woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it."
Genesis,3,7,"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves."
Genesis,3,8,"Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid themselves from the LORD God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,9,"So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"And he said, “I heard You in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”"
Genesis,3,11,"Then He asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”"
Genesis,3,12,"Then the man replied, “The woman You gave to be with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,13,"So the LORD God asked the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “It was the serpent. He deceived me, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,14,"Then the LORD God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than any livestock and more than any wild animal. You will move on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,15,"I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel."
Genesis,3,16,"He said to the woman: I will intensify your labor pains; you will bear children in anguish. Your desire will be for your husband, yet he will rule over you."
Genesis,3,17,"And He said to Adam, “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘Do not eat from it’: The ground is cursed because of you. You will eat from it by means of painful labor all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,18,"It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field."
Genesis,3,19,"You will eat bread by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground, since you were taken from it. For you are dust, and you will return to dust.”"
Genesis,3,20,Adam named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living.
Genesis,3,21,"The LORD God made clothing out of skins for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them."
Genesis,3,22,"The LORD God said, “Since man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil, he must not reach out, take from the tree of life, eat, and live forever.”"
Genesis,3,23,So the LORD God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis,3,24,"He drove man out and stationed the cherubim and the flaming, whirling sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life."
Genesis,4,1,"Adam was intimate with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. She said, “I have had a male child with the LORD’s help.”"
Genesis,4,2,"Then she also gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel became a shepherd of flocks, but Cain worked the ground."
Genesis,4,3,In the course of time Cain presented some of the land’s produce as an offering to the LORD.
Genesis,4,4,"And Abel also presented an offering—some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,"but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he looked despondent."
Genesis,4,6,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you furious? And why do you look despondent?"
Genesis,4,7,"If you do what is right, won’t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”"
Genesis,4,8,"Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s guardian?”"
Genesis,4,10,"Then He said, “What have you done? Your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground!"
Genesis,4,11,"So now you are cursed, alienated, from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood you have shed."
Genesis,4,12,"If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”"
Genesis,4,13,"But Cain answered the LORD, “My punishment is too great to bear!"
Genesis,4,14,"Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,"Then the LORD replied to him, “In that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him."
Genesis,4,16,"Then Cain went out from the LORD’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Cain was intimate with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain became the builder of a city, and he named the city Enoch after his son."
Genesis,4,18,"Irad was born to Enoch, Irad fathered Mehujael, Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech."
Genesis,4,19,"Lamech took two wives for himself, one named Adah and the other named Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of the nomadic herdsmen.
Genesis,4,21,His brother was named Jubal; he was the father of all who play the lyre and the flute.
Genesis,4,22,"Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. Tubal-cain’s sister was Naamah."
Genesis,4,23,"Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, pay attention to my words. For I killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me."
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain is to be avenged seven times over, then for Lamech it will be seventy-seven times!"
Genesis,4,25,"Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, for she said, “God has given me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”"
Genesis,4,26,"A son was born to Seth also, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of Yahweh."
Genesis,5,1,"These are the family records of the descendants of Adam. On the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God;"
Genesis,5,2,"He created them male and female. When they were created, He blessed them and called them man."
Genesis,5,3,"Adam was 130 years old when he fathered a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth."
Genesis,5,4,"Adam lived 800 years after the birth of Seth, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,5,So Adam’s life lasted 930 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,6,Seth was 105 years old when he fathered Enosh.
Genesis,5,7,"Seth lived 807 years after the birth of Enosh, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,8,So Seth’s life lasted 912 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,9,Enosh was 90 years old when he fathered Kenan.
Genesis,5,10,"Enosh lived 815 years after the birth of Kenan, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,11,So Enosh’s life lasted 905 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,12,Kenan was 70 years old when he fathered Mahalalel.
Genesis,5,13,"Kenan lived 840 years after the birth of Mahalalel, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,14,So Kenan’s life lasted 910 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,15,Mahalalel was 65 years old when he fathered Jared.
Genesis,5,16,"Mahalalel lived 830 years after the birth of Jared, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,17,So Mahalalel’s life lasted 895 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,18,Jared was 162 years old when he fathered Enoch.
Genesis,5,19,"Jared lived 800 years after the birth of Enoch, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,20,So Jared’s life lasted 962 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,21,Enoch was 65 years old when he fathered Methuselah.
Genesis,5,22,"And after the birth of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,23,So Enoch’s life lasted 365 years.
Genesis,5,24,Enoch walked with God; then he was not there because God took him.
Genesis,5,25,Methuselah was 187 years old when he fathered Lamech.
Genesis,5,26,"Methuselah lived 782 years after the birth of Lamech, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,27,So Methuselah’s life lasted 969 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,28,Lamech was 182 years old when he fathered a son.
Genesis,5,29,"And he named him Noah, saying, “This one will bring us relief from the agonizing labor of our hands, caused by the ground the LORD has cursed.”"
Genesis,5,30,"Lamech lived 595 years after Noah’s birth, and he fathered other sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,31,So Lamech’s life lasted 777 years; then he died.
Genesis,5,32,"Noah was 500 years old, and he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,1,"When mankind began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them,"
Genesis,6,2,"the sons of God saw that the daughters of mankind were beautiful, and they took any they chose as wives for themselves."
Genesis,6,3,"And the LORD said, “My Spirit will not remain with mankind forever, because they are corrupt. Their days will be 120 years.”"
Genesis,6,4,"The Nephilim were on the earth both in those days and afterward, when the sons of God came to the daughters of mankind, who bore children to them. They were the powerful men of old, the famous men."
Genesis,6,5,"When the LORD saw that man’s wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every scheme his mind thought of was nothing but evil all the time,"
Genesis,6,6,"the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart."
Genesis,6,7,"Then the LORD said, “I will wipe off from the face of the earth mankind, whom I created, together with the animals, creatures that crawl, and birds of the sky—for I regret that I made them.”"
Genesis,6,8,"Noah, however, found favor in the sight of the LORD."
Genesis,6,9,"These are the family records of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God."
Genesis,6,10,"And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
Genesis,6,11,"Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, and the earth was filled with wickedness."
Genesis,6,12,"God saw how corrupt the earth was, for every creature had corrupted its way on the earth."
Genesis,6,13,"Then God said to Noah, “I have decided to put an end to every creature, for the earth is filled with wickedness because of them; therefore I am going to destroy them along with the earth."
Genesis,6,14,"“Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it with pitch inside and outside."
Genesis,6,15,"This is how you are to make it: The ark will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high."
Genesis,6,16,"You are to make a roof, finishing the sides of the ark to within 18 inches of the roof. You are to put a door in the side of the ark. Make it with lower, middle, and upper decks."
Genesis,6,17,“Understand that I am bringing a flood—floodwaters on the earth to destroy every creature under heaven with the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will die.
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark with your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives."
Genesis,6,19,"You are also to bring into the ark two of all the living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you."
Genesis,6,20,"Two of everything—from the birds according to their kinds, from the livestock according to their kinds, and from the animals that crawl on the ground according to their kinds—will come to you so that you can keep them alive."
Genesis,6,21,Take with you every kind of food that is eaten; gather it as food for you and for them.”
Genesis,6,22,And Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him.
Genesis,7,1,"Then the LORD said to Noah, “Enter the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before Me in this generation."
Genesis,7,2,"You are to take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, of all the clean animals, and two of the animals that are not clean, a male and its female,"
Genesis,7,3,"and seven pairs, male and female, of the birds of the sky—in order to keep offspring alive on the face of the whole earth."
Genesis,7,4,"Seven days from now I will make it rain on the earth 40 days and 40 nights, and I will wipe off from the face of the earth every living thing I have made.”"
Genesis,7,5,And Noah did everything that the LORD commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Noah was 600 years old when the flood came and water covered the earth.
Genesis,7,7,"So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives entered the ark because of the waters of the flood."
Genesis,7,8,"From the clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and every creature that crawls on the ground,"
Genesis,7,9,"two of each, male and female, entered the ark with Noah, just as God had commanded him."
Genesis,7,10,Seven days later the waters of the flood came on the earth.
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the sources of the watery depths burst open, the floodgates of the sky were opened,"
Genesis,7,12,and the rain fell on the earth 40 days and 40 nights.
Genesis,7,13,"On that same day Noah along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah’s wife, and his three sons’ wives entered the ark with him."
Genesis,7,14,"They entered it with all the wildlife according to their kinds, all livestock according to their kinds, the creatures that crawl on the earth according to their kinds, all birds, every fowl, and everything with wings according to their kinds."
Genesis,7,15,Two of all flesh that has the breath of life in it entered the ark with Noah.
Genesis,7,16,"Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered just as God had commanded him. Then the LORD shut him in."
Genesis,7,17,The flood continued for 40 days on the earth; the waters increased and lifted up the ark so that it rose above the earth.
Genesis,7,18,"The waters surged and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water."
Genesis,7,19,"Then the waters surged even higher on the earth, and all the high mountains under the whole sky were covered."
Genesis,7,20,The mountains were covered as the waters surged above them more than 20 feet.
Genesis,7,21,"Every creature perished—those that crawl on the earth, birds, livestock, wildlife, and those that swarm on the earth, as well as all mankind."
Genesis,7,22,Everything with the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils—everything on dry land died.
Genesis,7,23,"He wiped out every living thing that was on the surface of the ground, from mankind to livestock, to creatures that crawl, to the birds of the sky, and they were wiped off the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark."
Genesis,7,24,And the waters surged on the earth 150 days.
Genesis,8,1,"God remembered Noah, as well as all the wildlife and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water began to subside."
Genesis,8,2,"The sources of the watery depths and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky stopped."
Genesis,8,3,"The water steadily receded from the earth, and by the end of 150 days the waters had decreased significantly."
Genesis,8,4,"The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis,8,5,"The waters continued to recede until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible."
Genesis,8,6,"After 40 days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made,"
Genesis,8,7,and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.
Genesis,8,8,"Then he sent out a dove to see whether the water on the earth’s surface had gone down,"
Genesis,8,9,but the dove found no resting place for her foot. She returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole earth. He reached out and brought her into the ark to himself.
Genesis,8,10,So Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove from the ark again.
Genesis,8,11,"When the dove came to him at evening, there was a plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the water on the earth’s surface had gone down."
Genesis,8,12,"After he had waited another seven days, he sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again."
Genesis,8,13,"In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the water that had covered the earth was dried up. Then Noah removed the ark’s cover and saw that the surface of the ground was drying."
Genesis,8,14,"By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was dry."
Genesis,8,15,"Then God spoke to Noah,"
Genesis,8,16,"“Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring out all the living creatures that are with you—birds, livestock, those that crawl on the ground—and they will spread over the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,8,18,"So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, came out."
Genesis,8,19,"All wildlife, all livestock, every bird, and every creature that crawls on the earth came out of the ark by their groups."
Genesis,8,20,Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. He took some of every kind of clean animal and every kind of clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis,8,21,"When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, He said to Himself, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, even though man’s inclination is evil from his youth. And I will never again strike down every living thing as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”"
Genesis,9,1,"God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"The fear and terror of you will be in every living creature on the earth, every bird of the sky, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are placed under your authority."
Genesis,9,3,"Every living creature will be food for you; as I gave the green plants, I have given you everything."
Genesis,9,4,"However, you must not eat meat with its lifeblood in it."
Genesis,9,5,I will require the life of every animal and every man for your life and your blood. I will require the life of each man’s brother for a man’s life.
Genesis,9,6,"Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in His image."
Genesis,9,7,"But you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out over the earth and multiply on it.”"
Genesis,9,8,"Then God said to Noah and his sons with him,"
Genesis,9,9,"“Understand that I am confirming My covenant with you and your descendants after you,"
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you—birds, livestock, and all wildlife of the earth that are with you—all the animals of the earth that came out of the ark."
Genesis,9,11,I confirm My covenant with you that never again will every creature be wiped out by the waters of a flood; there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”
Genesis,9,12,"And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all future generations:"
Genesis,9,13,"I have placed My bow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the bow appears in the clouds,"
Genesis,9,15,I will remember My covenant between Me and you and all the living creatures: water will never again become a flood to destroy every creature.
Genesis,9,16,"The bow will be in the clouds, and I will look at it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all the living creatures on earth.”"
Genesis,9,17,"God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have confirmed between Me and every creature on earth.”"
Genesis,9,18,"Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan."
Genesis,9,19,"These three were Noah’s sons, and from them the whole earth was populated."
Genesis,9,20,"Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard."
Genesis,9,21,"He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent."
Genesis,9,22,"Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside."
Genesis,9,23,"Then Shem and Japheth took a cloak and placed it over both their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father naked."
Genesis,9,24,"When Noah awoke from his drinking and learned what his youngest son had done to him,"
Genesis,9,25,he said: Canaan will be cursed. He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers.
Genesis,9,26,"He also said: Praise the LORD, the God of Shem; Canaan will be his slave."
Genesis,9,27,God will extend Japheth; he will dwell in the tents of Shem; Canaan will be his slave.
Genesis,9,28,Now Noah lived 350 years after the flood.
Genesis,9,29,So Noah’s life lasted 950 years; then he died.
Genesis,10,1,"These are the family records of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They also had sons after the flood."

Genesis,10,7,"Cush’s sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And Raamah’s sons: Sheba and Dedan."
Genesis,10,8,"Cush fathered Nimrod, who was the first powerful man on earth."
Genesis,10,9,"He was a powerful hunter in the sight of the LORD. That is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a powerful hunter in the sight of the LORD.”"
Genesis,10,10,"His kingdom started with Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
Genesis,10,11,"From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah,"
Genesis,10,12,"and Resen, between Nineveh and the great city Calah."
Genesis,10,13,"Mizraim fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,"

Genesis,11,1,At one time the whole earth had the same language and vocabulary.
Genesis,11,2,"As people migrated from the east, they found a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there."
Genesis,11,3,"They said to each other, “Come, let us make oven-fired bricks.” They used brick for stone and asphalt for mortar."
Genesis,11,4,"And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky. Let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise, we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”"
Genesis,11,5,Then the LORD came down to look over the city and the tower that the men were building.
Genesis,11,6,"The LORD said, “If they have begun to do this as one people all having the same language, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them."
Genesis,11,7,"Come, let Us go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”"
Genesis,11,8,"So from there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city."
Genesis,11,9,"Therefore its name is called Babylon, for there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth."

Genesis,11,27,"These are the family records of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran fathered Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans, during his father Terah’s lifetime."
Genesis,11,29,"Abram and Nahor took wives: Abram’s wife was named Sarai, and Nahor’s wife was named Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah."
Genesis,11,30,Sarai was unable to conceive; she did not have a child.
Genesis,11,31,"Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran’s son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there."
Genesis,11,32,Terah lived 205 years and died in Haran.
Genesis,12,1,"The LORD said to Abram: Go out from your land, your relatives, and your father’s house to the land that I will show you."
Genesis,12,2,"I will make you into a great nation, I will bless you, I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing."
Genesis,12,3,"I will bless those who bless you, I will curse those who treat you with contempt, and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
Genesis,12,4,"So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran."
Genesis,12,5,"He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the people he had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,"
Genesis,12,6,"Abram passed through the land to the site of Shechem, at the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land."
Genesis,12,7,"Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him."
Genesis,12,8,"From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to Yahweh there, and he called on the name of Yahweh."
Genesis,12,9,Then Abram journeyed by stages to the Negev.
Genesis,12,10,"There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine in the land was severe."
Genesis,12,11,"When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “Look, I know what a beautiful woman you are."
Genesis,12,12,"When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me but let you live."
Genesis,12,13,"Please say you’re my sister so it will go well for me because of you, and my life will be spared on your account.”"
Genesis,12,14,"When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful."
Genesis,12,15,"Pharaoh’s officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, so the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s household."
Genesis,12,16,"He treated Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired flocks and herds, male and female donkeys, male and female slaves, and camels."
Genesis,12,17,But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
Genesis,12,18,"So Pharaoh sent for Abram and said, “What have you done to me? Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?"
Genesis,12,19,"Why did you say, ‘She’s my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!”"
Genesis,12,20,"Then Pharaoh gave his men orders about him, and they sent him away with his wife and all he had."
Genesis,13,1,"Then Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev—he, his wife, and all he had, and Lot with him."
Genesis,13,2,"Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold."
Genesis,13,3,"He went by stages from the Negev to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been,"
Genesis,13,4,to the site where he had built the altar. And Abram called on the name of Yahweh there.
Genesis,13,5,"Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents."
Genesis,13,6,"But the land was unable to support them as long as they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they could not stay together,"
Genesis,13,7,and there was quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land.
Genesis,13,8,"Then Abram said to Lot, “Please, let’s not have quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, since we are relatives."
Genesis,13,9,"Isn’t the whole land before you? Separate from me: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left.”"
Genesis,13,10,Lot looked out and saw that the entire Jordan Valley as far as Zoar was well watered everywhere like the LORD’s garden and the land of Egypt. This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
Genesis,13,11,"So Lot chose the entire Jordan Valley for himself. Then Lot journeyed eastward, and they separated from each other."
Genesis,13,12,"Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot lived in the cities of the valley and set up his tent near Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,"Now the men of Sodom were evil, sinning greatly against the LORD."
Genesis,13,14,"After Lot had separated from him, the LORD said to Abram, “Look from the place where you are. Look north and south, east and west,"
Genesis,13,15,for I will give you and your offspring forever all the land that you see.
Genesis,13,16,"I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust of the earth, then your offspring could be counted."
Genesis,13,17,"Get up and walk around the land, through its length and width, for I will give it to you.”"
Genesis,13,18,"So Abram moved his tent and went to live near the oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD."
Genesis,14,1,"In those days Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim"
Genesis,14,2,"waged war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, as well as the king of Bela (that is, Zoar)."
Genesis,14,3,"All of these came as allies to the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea)."
Genesis,14,4,"They were subject to Chedorlaomer for 12 years, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
Genesis,14,5,"In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,"
Genesis,14,6,"and the Horites in the mountains of Seir, as far as El-paran by the wilderness."
Genesis,14,7,"Then they came back to invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they defeated all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar."
Genesis,14,8,"Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and lined up for battle in the Valley of Siddim"
Genesis,14,9,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five."
Genesis,14,10,"Now the Valley of Siddim contained many asphalt pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, but the rest fled to the mountains."
Genesis,14,11,The four kings took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and went on.
Genesis,14,12,"They also took Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, for he was living in Sodom, and they went on."
Genesis,14,13,"One of the survivors came and told Abram the Hebrew, who lived near the oaks belonging to Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and the brother of Aner. They were bound by a treaty with Abram."
Genesis,14,14,"When Abram heard that his relative had been taken prisoner, he assembled his 318 trained men, born in his household, and they went in pursuit as far as Dan."
Genesis,14,15,"And he and his servants deployed against them by night, attacked them, and pursued them as far as Hobah to the north of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"He brought back all the goods and also his relative Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the other people."
Genesis,14,17,"After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley)."
Genesis,14,18,"Then Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; he was a priest to God Most High."
Genesis,14,19,"He blessed him and said: Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,20,and I give praise to God Most High who has handed over your enemies to you. And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
Genesis,14,21,"Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but take the possessions for yourself.”"
Genesis,14,22,"But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand in an oath to Yahweh, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,23,"that I will not take a thread or sandal strap or anything that belongs to you, so you can never say, ‘I made Abram rich.’"
Genesis,14,24,"I will take nothing except what the servants have eaten. But as for the share of the men who came with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre—they can take their share.”"
Genesis,15,1,"After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great."
Genesis,15,2,"But Abram said, “Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I am childless and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”"
Genesis,15,3,"Abram continued, “Look, You have given me no offspring, so a slave born in my house will be my heir.”"
Genesis,15,4,"Now the word of the LORD came to him: “This one will not be your heir; instead, one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”"
Genesis,15,5,"He took him outside and said, “Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then He said to him, “Your offspring will be that numerous.”"
Genesis,15,6,"Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness."
Genesis,15,7,"He also said to him, “I am Yahweh who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”"
Genesis,15,8,"But he said, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?”"
Genesis,15,9,"He said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,"So he brought all these to Him, split them down the middle, and laid the pieces opposite each other, but he did not cut up the birds."
Genesis,15,11,"Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away."
Genesis,15,12,"As the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell on Abram, and suddenly great terror and darkness descended on him."
Genesis,15,13,"Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know this for certain: Your offspring will be foreigners in a land that does not belong to them; they will be enslaved and oppressed 400 years."
Genesis,15,14,"However, I will judge the nation they serve, and afterward they will go out with many possessions."
Genesis,15,15,But you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.
Genesis,15,16,"In the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”"
Genesis,15,17,"When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals."
Genesis,15,18,"On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I give this land to your offspring, from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River:"
Genesis,15,19,"the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,"
Genesis,15,20,"Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim,"
Genesis,15,21,"Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”"
Genesis,16,1,"Abram’s wife Sarai had not borne any children for him, but she owned an Egyptian slave named Hagar."
Genesis,16,2,"Sarai said to Abram, “Since the LORD has prevented me from bearing children, go to my slave; perhaps through her I can build a family.” And Abram agreed to what Sarai said."
Genesis,16,3,"So Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife for him. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan 10 years."
Genesis,16,4,"He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she treated her mistress with contempt."
Genesis,16,5,"Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for my suffering! I put my slave in your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between me and you.”"
Genesis,16,6,"Abram replied to Sarai, “Here, your slave is in your hands; do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her."
Genesis,16,7,"The Angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur."
Genesis,16,8,"He said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She replied, “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai.”"
Genesis,16,9,"Then the Angel of the LORD said to her, “You must go back to your mistress and submit to her mistreatment.”"
Genesis,16,10,"The Angel of the LORD also said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, and they will be too many to count.”"
Genesis,16,11,"Then the Angel of the LORD said to her: You have conceived and will have a son. You will name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction."
Genesis,16,12,"This man will be like a wild donkey. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him; he will live at odds with all his brothers."
Genesis,16,13,"So she called the LORD who spoke to her: The God Who Sees, for she said, “In this place, have I actually seen the One who sees me?”"
Genesis,16,14,"That is why she named the spring, “A Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.” It is located between Kadesh and Bered."
Genesis,16,15,"So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son Hagar had."
Genesis,16,16,Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
Genesis,17,1,"When Abram was 99 years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, “I am God Almighty. Live in My presence and be blameless."
Genesis,17,2,"I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you greatly.”"
Genesis,17,3,Then Abram fell facedown and God spoke with him:
Genesis,17,4,"“As for Me, My covenant is with you: you will become the father of many nations."
Genesis,17,5,"Your name will no longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I will make you the father of many nations."
Genesis,17,6,I will make you extremely fruitful and will make nations and kings come from you.
Genesis,17,7,"I will keep My covenant between Me and you, and your future offspring throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant to be your God and the God of your offspring after you."
Genesis,17,8,"And to you and your future offspring I will give the land where you are residing—all the land of Canaan—as an eternal possession, and I will be their God.”"
Genesis,17,9,"God also said to Abraham, “As for you, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep My covenant."
Genesis,17,10,"This is My covenant, which you are to keep, between Me and you and your offspring after you: Every one of your males must be circumcised."
Genesis,17,11,You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
Genesis,17,12,"Throughout your generations, every male among you at eight days old is to be circumcised. This includes a slave born in your house and one purchased with money from any foreigner. The one who is not your offspring,"
Genesis,17,13,"a slave born in your house, as well as one purchased with money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be marked in your flesh as an everlasting covenant."
Genesis,17,14,"If any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that man will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”"
Genesis,17,15,"God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, do not call her Sarai, for Sarah will be her name."
Genesis,17,16,"I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will produce nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”"
Genesis,17,17,"Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a hundred-year-old man? Can Sarah, a ninety-year-old woman, give birth?”"
Genesis,17,18,"So Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael were acceptable to You!”"
Genesis,17,19,"But God said, “No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his future offspring."
Genesis,17,20,"As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will certainly bless him; I will make him fruitful and will multiply him greatly. He will father 12 tribal leaders, and I will make him into a great nation."
Genesis,17,21,"But I will confirm My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”"
Genesis,17,22,"When He finished talking with him, God withdrew from Abraham."
Genesis,17,23,"Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house or purchased with his money—every male among the members of Abraham’s household—and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day, just as God had said to him."
Genesis,17,24,"Abraham was 99 years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised,"
Genesis,17,25,and his son Ishmael was 13 years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
Genesis,17,26,On that same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
Genesis,17,27,And all the men of his household—both slaves born in his house and those purchased with money from a foreigner—were circumcised with him.
Genesis,18,1,Then the LORD appeared to Abraham at the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting in the entrance of his tent during the heat of the day.
Genesis,18,2,"He looked up, and he saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them and bowed to the ground."
Genesis,18,3,"Then he said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, please do not go on past your servant."
Genesis,18,4,"Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree."
Genesis,18,5,"I will bring a bit of bread so that you may strengthen yourselves. This is why you have passed your servant’s way. Later, you can continue on.” “Yes,” they replied, “do as you have said.”"
Genesis,18,6,"So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Knead three measures of fine flour and make bread.”"
Genesis,18,7,"Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd and got a tender, choice calf. He gave it to a young man, who hurried to prepare it."
Genesis,18,8,"Then Abraham took curds and milk, and the calf that he had prepared, and set them before the men. He served them as they ate under the tree."
Genesis,18,9,"“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There, in the tent,” he answered."
Genesis,18,10,"The LORD said, “I will certainly come back to you in about a year’s time, and your wife Sarah will have a son!” Now Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent behind him."
Genesis,18,11,Abraham and Sarah were old and getting on in years. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
Genesis,18,12,"So she laughed to herself: “After I have become shriveled up and my lord is old, will I have delight?”"
Genesis,18,13,"But the LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Can I really have a baby when I’m old?’"
Genesis,18,14,"Is anything impossible for the LORD? At the appointed time I will come back to you, and in about a year she will have a son.”"
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah denied it. “I did not laugh,” she said, because she was afraid. But He replied, “No, you did laugh.”"
Genesis,18,16,"The men got up from there and looked out over Sodom, and Abraham was walking with them to see them off."
Genesis,18,17,"Then the LORD said, “Should I hide what I am about to do from Abraham?"
Genesis,18,18,"Abraham is to become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him."
Genesis,18,19,For I have chosen him so that he will command his children and his house after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just. This is how the LORD will fulfill to Abraham what He promised him.”
Genesis,18,20,"Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is immense, and their sin is extremely serious."
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down to see if what they have done justifies the cry that has come up to Me. If not, I will find out.”"
Genesis,18,22,The men turned from there and went toward Sodom while Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
Genesis,18,23,"Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?"
Genesis,18,24,What if there are 50 righteous people in the city? Will You really sweep it away instead of sparing the place for the sake of the 50 righteous people who are in it?
Genesis,18,25,"You could not possibly do such a thing: to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. You could not possibly do that! Won’t the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”"
Genesis,18,26,"The LORD said, “If I find 50 righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”"
Genesis,18,27,"Then Abraham answered, “Since I have ventured to speak to the Lord—even though I am dust and ashes—"
Genesis,18,28,"suppose the 50 righteous lack five. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” He replied, “I will not destroy it if I find 45 there.”"
Genesis,18,29,"Then he spoke to Him again, “Suppose 40 are found there?” He answered, “I will not do it on account of 40.”"
Genesis,18,30,"Then he said, “Let the Lord not be angry, and I will speak further. Suppose 30 are found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find 30 there.”"
Genesis,18,31,"Then he said, “Since I have ventured to speak to the Lord, suppose 20 are found there?” He replied, “I will not destroy it on account of 20.”"
Genesis,18,32,"Then he said, “Let the Lord not be angry, and I will speak one more time. Suppose 10 are found there?” He answered, “I will not destroy it on account of 10.”"
Genesis,18,33,"When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, He departed, and Abraham returned to his place."
Genesis,19,1,"The two angels entered Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting at Sodom’s gate. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them. He bowed with his face to the ground"
Genesis,19,2,"and said, “My lords, turn aside to your servant’s house, wash your feet, and spend the night. Then you can get up early and go on your way.” “No,” they said. “We would rather spend the night in the square.”"
Genesis,19,3,"But he urged them so strongly that they followed him and went into his house. He prepared a feast and baked unleavened bread for them, and they ate."
Genesis,19,4,"Before they went to bed, the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, the whole population, surrounded the house."
Genesis,19,5,"They called out to Lot and said, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Send them out to us so we can have sex with them!”"
Genesis,19,6,Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him.
Genesis,19,7,"He said, “Don’t do this evil, my brothers."
Genesis,19,8,"Look, I’ve got two daughters who haven’t had sexual relations with a man. I’ll bring them out to you, and you can do whatever you want to them. However, don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the protection of my roof.”"
Genesis,19,9,"“Get out of the way!” they said, adding, “This one came here as a foreigner, but he’s acting like a judge! Now we’ll do more harm to you than to them.” They put pressure on Lot and came up to break down the door."
Genesis,19,10,"But the angels reached out, brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door."
Genesis,19,11,"They struck the men who were at the entrance of the house, both young and old, with a blinding light so that they were unable to find the entrance."
Genesis,19,12,"Then the angels said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here: a son-in-law, your sons and daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of this place,"
Genesis,19,13,"for we are about to destroy this place because the outcry against its people is so great before the LORD, that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”"
Genesis,19,14,"So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were going to marry his daughters. “Get up,” he said. “Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking."
Genesis,19,15,"At daybreak the angels urged Lot on: “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.”"
Genesis,19,16,"But he hesitated. Because of the LORD’s compassion for him, the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hands of his two daughters. Then they brought him out and left him outside the city."
Genesis,19,17,"As soon as the angels got them outside, one of them said, “Run for your lives! Don’t look back and don’t stop anywhere on the plain! Run to the mountains, or you will be swept away!”"
Genesis,19,18,"But Lot said to them, “No, my lords—please."
Genesis,19,19,"Your servant has indeed found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness by saving my life. But I can’t run to the mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die."
Genesis,19,20,"Look, this town is close enough for me to run to. It is a small place. Please let me go there—it’s only a small place, isn’t it?—so that I can survive.”"
Genesis,19,21,"And he said to him, “All right, I’ll grant your request about this matter too and will not demolish the town you mentioned."
Genesis,19,22,"Hurry up! Run there, for I cannot do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city is Zoar."
Genesis,19,23,The sun had risen over the land when Lot reached Zoar.
Genesis,19,24,Then out of the sky the LORD rained burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD.
Genesis,19,25,"He demolished these cities, the entire plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground."
Genesis,19,26,But his wife looked back and became a pillar of salt.
Genesis,19,27,Early in the morning Abraham went to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
Genesis,19,28,"He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw that smoke was going up from the land like the smoke of a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of the middle of the upheaval when He demolished the cities where Lot had lived."
Genesis,19,30,"Lot departed from Zoar and lived in the mountains along with his two daughters, because he was afraid to live in Zoar. Instead, he and his two daughters lived in a cave."
Genesis,19,31,"Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us as is the custom of all the land."
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let’s get our father to drink wine so that we can sleep with him and preserve our father’s line.”"
Genesis,19,33,"So they got their father to drink wine that night, and the firstborn came and slept with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she got up."
Genesis,19,34,"The next day the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight so you can go sleep with him and we can preserve our father’s line.”"
Genesis,19,35,"That night they again got their father to drink wine, and the younger went and slept with him; he did not know when she lay down or when she got up."
Genesis,19,36,So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
Genesis,19,37,The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today.
Genesis,19,38,"The younger also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today."
Genesis,20,1,"From there Abraham traveled to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he lived in Gerar,"
Genesis,20,2,"Abraham said about his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him."
Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”"
Genesis,20,4,"Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?"
Genesis,20,5,"Didn’t he himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I did this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”"
Genesis,20,6,"Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. I have also kept you from sinning against Me. Therefore I have not let you touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will certainly die, you and all who are yours.”"
Genesis,20,8,"Early in the morning Abimelech got up, called all his servants together, and personally told them all these things, and the men were terrified."
Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said to him, “What have you done to us? How did I sin against you that you have brought such enormous guilt on me and on my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.”"
Genesis,20,10,"Abimelech also said to Abraham, “What did you intend when you did this thing?”"
Genesis,20,11,"Abraham replied, “I thought, ‘There is absolutely no fear of God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.’"
Genesis,20,12,"Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"So when God had me wander from my father’s house, I said to her: Show your loyalty to me wherever we go and say about me: ‘He’s my brother.’”"
Genesis,20,14,"Then Abimelech took sheep and cattle and male and female slaves, gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him."
Genesis,20,15,"Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you want.”"
Genesis,20,16,"And he said to Sarah, “Look, I am giving your brother 1,000 pieces of silver. It is a verification of your honor to all who are with you. You are fully vindicated.”"
Genesis,20,17,"Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could bear children,"
Genesis,20,18,"for the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household on account of Sarah, Abraham’s wife."
Genesis,21,1,"The LORD came to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised."
Genesis,21,2,"Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time God had told him."
Genesis,21,3,Abraham named his son who was born to him—the one Sarah bore to him—Isaac.
Genesis,21,4,"When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis,21,6,"Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears will laugh with me.”"
Genesis,21,7,"She also said, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son for him in his old age.”"
Genesis,21,8,"The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned."
Genesis,21,9,But Sarah saw the son mocking—the one Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham.
Genesis,21,10,"So she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave with her son, for the son of this slave will not be a coheir with my son Isaac!”"
Genesis,21,11,Now this was a very difficult thing for Abraham because of his son.
Genesis,21,12,"But God said to Abraham, “Do not be concerned about the boy and your slave. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, because your offspring will be traced through Isaac."
Genesis,21,13,But I will also make a nation of the slave’s son because he is your offspring.”
Genesis,21,14,"Early in the morning Abraham got up, took bread and a waterskin, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her and the boy away. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beer-sheba."
Genesis,21,15,"When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes."
Genesis,21,16,"Then she went and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I can’t bear to watch the boy die!” So as she sat nearby, she wept loudly."
Genesis,21,17,"God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What’s wrong, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from the place where he is."
Genesis,21,18,"Get up, help the boy up, and support him, for I will make him a great nation.”"
Genesis,21,19,"Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the waterskin and gave the boy a drink."
Genesis,21,20,"God was with the boy, and he grew; he settled in the wilderness and became an archer."
Genesis,21,21,"He settled in the Wilderness of Paran, and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt."
Genesis,21,22,"At that time Abimelech, accompanied by Phicol the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do."
Genesis,21,23,"Swear to me by God here and now, that you will not break an agreement with me or with my children and descendants. As I have been loyal to you, so you will be loyal to me and to the country where you are a foreign resident.”"
Genesis,21,24,"And Abraham said, “I swear it.”"
Genesis,21,25,But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the water well that Abimelech’s servants had seized.
Genesis,21,26,"Abimelech replied, “I don’t know who did this thing. You didn’t report anything to me, so I hadn’t heard about it until today.”"
Genesis,21,27,"Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant."
Genesis,21,28,Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock.
Genesis,21,29,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, “Why have you separated these seven ewe lambs?”"
Genesis,21,30,"He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand so that this act will serve as my witness that I dug this well.”"
Genesis,21,31,Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba because it was there that the two of them swore an oath.
Genesis,21,32,"After they had made a covenant at Beer-sheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he called on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God."
Genesis,21,34,And Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for many days.
Genesis,22,1,"After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he answered."
Genesis,22,2,"“Take your son,” He said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love, go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.”"
Genesis,22,3,"So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took with him two of his young men and his son Isaac. He split wood for a burnt offering and set out to go to the place God had told him about."
Genesis,22,4,On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
Genesis,22,5,"Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship; then we’ll come back to you.”"
Genesis,22,6,"Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac. In his hand he took the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together."
Genesis,22,7,"Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, “My father.” And he replied, “Here I am, my son.” Isaac said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”"
Genesis,22,8,"Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” Then the two of them walked on together."
Genesis,22,9,"When they arrived at the place that God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood."
Genesis,22,10,Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.
Genesis,22,11,"But the Angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He replied, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,22,12,"Then He said, “Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from Me.”"
Genesis,22,13,Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
Genesis,22,14,"And Abraham named that place The LORD Will Provide, so today it is said: “It will be provided on the LORD’s mountain.”"
Genesis,22,15,Then the Angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
Genesis,22,16,"and said, “By Myself I have sworn,” this is the LORD’s declaration: “Because you have done this thing and have not withheld your only son,"
Genesis,22,17,I will indeed bless you and make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gates of their enemies.
Genesis,22,18,And all the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring because you have obeyed My command.”
Genesis,22,19,"Abraham went back to his young men, and they got up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham settled in Beer-sheba."
Genesis,22,20,"Now after these things Abraham was told, “Milcah also has borne sons to your brother Nahor:"
Genesis,22,21,"Uz his firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel the father of Aram,"
Genesis,22,22,"Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”"
Genesis,22,23,"And Bethuel fathered Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight to Nahor, Abraham’s brother."
Genesis,22,24,"His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah."
Genesis,23,1,Now Sarah lived 127 years; these were all the years of her life.
Genesis,23,2,"Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her."
Genesis,23,3,Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites:
Genesis,23,4,“I am a foreign resident among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my dead.”
Genesis,23,5,"The Hittites replied to Abraham,"
Genesis,23,6,"“Listen to us, lord. You are God’s chosen one among us. Bury your dead in our finest burial place. None of us will withhold from you his burial place for burying your dead.”"
Genesis,23,7,"Then Abraham rose and bowed down to the Hittites, the people of the land."
Genesis,23,8,"He said to them, “If you are willing for me to bury my dead, listen to me and ask Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf"
Genesis,23,9,"to give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me in your presence, for the full price, as a burial place.”"
Genesis,23,10,"Ephron was sitting among the Hittites. So in the presence of all the Hittites who came to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham:"
Genesis,23,11,"“No, my lord. Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,12,Abraham bowed down to the people of the land
Genesis,23,13,"and said to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, “Please listen to me. Let me pay the price of the field. Accept it from me, and let me bury my dead there.”"
Genesis,23,14,"Ephron answered Abraham and said to him,"
Genesis,23,15,"“My lord, listen to me. Land worth 400 shekels of silver—what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”"
Genesis,23,16,"Abraham agreed with Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver that he had agreed to in the presence of the Hittites: 400 shekels of silver at the current commercial rate."
Genesis,23,17,So Ephron’s field at Machpelah near Mamre—the field with its cave and all the trees anywhere within the boundaries of the field—became
Genesis,23,18,Abraham’s possession in the presence of all the Hittites who came to the gate of his city.
Genesis,23,19,"After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,23,20,The field with its cave passed from the Hittites to Abraham as a burial place.
Genesis,24,1,"Abraham was now old, getting on in years, and the LORD had blessed him in everything."
Genesis,24,2,"Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household who managed all he owned, “Place your hand under my thigh,"
Genesis,24,3,"and I will have you swear by the LORD, God of heaven and God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live,"
Genesis,24,4,but will go to my land and my family to take a wife for my son Isaac.”
Genesis,24,5,"The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Should I have your son go back to the land you came from?”"
Genesis,24,6,"Abraham answered him, “Make sure that you don’t take my son back there."
Genesis,24,7,"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from my native land, who spoke to me and swore to me, ‘I will give this land to your offspring’—He will send His angel before you, and you can take a wife for my son from there."
Genesis,24,8,"If the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are free from this oath to me, but don’t let my son go back there.”"
Genesis,24,9,So the servant placed his hand under his master Abraham’s thigh and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
Genesis,24,10,The servant took 10 of his master’s camels and departed with all kinds of his master’s goods in hand. Then he set out for Nahor’s town Aram-naharaim.
Genesis,24,11,He made the camels kneel beside a well of water outside the town at evening. This was the time when the women went out to draw water.
Genesis,24,12,"“LORD, God of my master Abraham,” he prayed, “give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,I am standing here at the spring where the daughters of the men of the town are coming out to draw water.
Genesis,24,14,"Let the girl to whom I say, ‘Please lower your water jug so that I may drink,’ and who responds, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels also’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”"
Genesis,24,15,"Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah—daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor—coming with a jug on her shoulder."
Genesis,24,16,"Now the girl was very beautiful, a young woman who had not known a man intimately. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came up."
Genesis,24,17,"Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jug.”"
Genesis,24,18,"She replied, “Drink, my lord.” She quickly lowered her jug to her hand and gave him a drink."
Genesis,24,19,"When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I’ll also draw water for your camels until they have had enough to drink.”"
Genesis,24,20,She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and hurried to the well again to draw water. She drew water for all his camels
Genesis,24,21,while the man silently watched her to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success.
Genesis,24,22,"After the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel, and for her wrists two bracelets weighing 10 shekels of gold."
Genesis,24,23,"“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”"
Genesis,24,24,"She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”"
Genesis,24,25,"She also said to him, “We have plenty of straw and feed and a place to spend the night.”"
Genesis,24,26,"Then the man bowed down, worshiped the LORD,"
Genesis,24,27,"and said, “Praise the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”"
Genesis,24,28,The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
Genesis,24,29,"Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and Laban ran out to the man at the spring."
Genesis,24,30,"As soon as he had seen the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he had heard his sister Rebekah’s words—“The man said this to me!”—he went to the man. He was standing there by the camels at the spring."
Genesis,24,31,"Laban said, “Come, you who are blessed by the LORD. Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”"
Genesis,24,32,"So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were given to the camels, and water was brought to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him."
Genesis,24,33,"A meal was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.” So Laban said, “Please speak.”"
Genesis,24,34,"“I am Abraham’s servant,” he said."
Genesis,24,35,"“The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,24,36,"Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns."
Genesis,24,37,My master put me under this oath: ‘You will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I live
Genesis,24,38,but will go to my father’s household and to my family to take a wife for my son.’
Genesis,24,39,"But I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman will not come back with me?’"
Genesis,24,40,"He said to me, ‘The LORD before whom I have walked will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, and you will take a wife for my son from my family and from my father’s household."
Genesis,24,41,Then you will be free from my oath if you go to my family and they do not give her to you—you will be free from my oath.’
Genesis,24,42,"“Today when I came to the spring, I prayed: LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You will make my journey successful!"
Genesis,24,43,"I am standing here at a spring. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, and I say to her: Please let me drink a little water from your jug,"
Genesis,24,44,"and who responds to me, ‘Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels also’—let her be the woman the LORD has appointed for my master’s son."
Genesis,24,45,"“Before I had finished praying silently, there was Rebekah coming with her jug on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her: Please let me have a drink."
Genesis,24,46,"She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels also.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels."
Genesis,24,47,"Then I asked her: Whose daughter are you? She responded, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists."
Genesis,24,48,"Then I bowed down, worshiped the LORD, and praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who guided me on the right way to take the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son."
Genesis,24,49,"Now, if you are going to show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; if not, tell me, and I will go elsewhere.”"
Genesis,24,50,"Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter."
Genesis,24,51,"Rebekah is here in front of you. Take her and go, and let her be a wife for your master’s son, just as the LORD has spoken.”"
Genesis,24,52,"When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the LORD."
Genesis,24,53,"Then he brought out objects of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother."
Genesis,24,54,"Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said, “Send me to my master.”"
Genesis,24,55,"But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl stay with us for about 10 days. Then she can go.”"
Genesis,24,56,"But he responded to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me away so that I may go to my master.”"
Genesis,24,57,"So they said, “Let’s call the girl and ask her opinion.”"
Genesis,24,58,"They called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She replied, “I will go.”"
Genesis,24,59,"So they sent away their sister Rebekah with the one who had nursed and raised her, and Abraham’s servant and his men."
Genesis,24,60,"They blessed Rebekah, saying to her: Our sister, may you become thousands upon ten thousands. May your offspring possess the gates of their enemies."
Genesis,24,61,"Then Rebekah and her female servants got up, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left."
Genesis,24,62,"Now Isaac was returning from Beer-lahai-roi, for he was living in the Negev region."
Genesis,24,63,"In the early evening Isaac went out to walk in the field, and looking up he saw camels coming."
Genesis,24,64,"Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she got down from her camel"
Genesis,24,65,"and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” The servant answered, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.
Genesis,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and took Rebekah to be his wife. Isaac loved her, and he was comforted after his mother’s death."
Genesis,25,1,"Now Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah,"
Genesis,25,2,"and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s sons were the Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
Genesis,25,4,"And Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah."
Genesis,25,5,Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,"And Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines, but while he was still alive he sent them eastward, away from his son Isaac, to the land of the East."
Genesis,25,7,This is the length of Abraham’s life: 175 years.
Genesis,25,8,"He took his last breath and died at a ripe old age, old and contented, and he was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,9,"His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite."
Genesis,25,10,This was the field that Abraham bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.
Genesis,25,11,"After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi."
Genesis,25,12,"These are the family records of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave, bore to Abraham."
Genesis,25,13,"These are the names of Ishmael’s sons; their names according to the family records are: Nebaioth, Ishmael’s firstborn, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
Genesis,25,14,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
Genesis,25,16,"These are Ishmael’s sons, and these are their names by their villages and encampments: 12 leaders of their clans."
Genesis,25,17,"This is the length of Ishmael’s life: 137 years. He took his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people."
Genesis,25,18,"And they settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt as you go toward Asshur. He lived in opposition to all his brothers."
Genesis,25,19,These are the family records of Isaac son of Abraham. Abraham fathered Isaac.
Genesis,25,20,Isaac was 40 years old when he took as his wife Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
Genesis,25,21,"Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived."
Genesis,25,22,"But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the LORD."
Genesis,25,23,"And the LORD said to her: Two nations are in your womb; two people will come from you and be separated. One people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."
Genesis,25,24,"When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb."
Genesis,25,25,"The first one came out red-looking, covered with hair like a fur coat, and they named him Esau."
Genesis,25,26,"After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel with his hand. So he was named Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when they were born."
Genesis,25,27,"When the boys grew up, Esau became an expert hunter, an outdoorsman, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home."
Genesis,25,28,"Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
Genesis,25,29,"Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field exhausted."
Genesis,25,30,"He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, because I’m exhausted.” That is why he was also named Edom."
Genesis,25,31,"Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”"
Genesis,25,32,"“Look,” said Esau, “I’m about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”"
Genesis,25,33,"Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to Jacob and sold his birthright to him."
Genesis,25,34,"Then Jacob gave bread and lentil stew to Esau; he ate, drank, got up, and went away. So Esau despised his birthright."
Genesis,26,1,"There was another famine in the land in addition to the one that had occurred in Abraham’s time. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar."
Genesis,26,2,"The LORD appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Live in the land that I tell you about;"
Genesis,26,3,"stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham."
Genesis,26,4,"I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky, I will give your offspring all these lands, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring,"
Genesis,26,5,"because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My mandate, My commands, My statutes, and My instructions.”"
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac settled in Gerar.
Genesis,26,7,"When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say “my wife,” thinking, “The men of the place will kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is a beautiful woman.”"
Genesis,26,8,"When Isaac had been there for some time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah."
Genesis,26,9,"Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is really your wife! How could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might die on account of her.”"
Genesis,26,10,"Then Abimelech said, “What is this you’ve done to us? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.”"
Genesis,26,11,So Abimelech warned all the people with these words: “Whoever harms this man or his wife will certainly die.”
Genesis,26,12,"Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundred times what was sown. The LORD blessed him,"
Genesis,26,13,and the man became rich and kept getting richer until he was very wealthy.
Genesis,26,14,"He had flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and many slaves, and the Philistines were envious of him."
Genesis,26,15,"The Philistines stopped up all the wells that his father’s slaves had dug in the days of his father Abraham, filling them with dirt."
Genesis,26,16,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave us, for you are much too powerful for us.”"
Genesis,26,17,"So Isaac left there, camped in the Valley of Gerar, and lived there."
Genesis,26,18,Isaac reopened the water wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and that the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. He gave them the same names his father had given them.
Genesis,26,19,Then Isaac’s slaves dug in the valley and found a well of spring water there.
Genesis,26,20,"But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Quarrel because they quarreled with him."
Genesis,26,21,"Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also, so he named it Hostility."
Genesis,26,22,"He moved from there and dug another, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Open Spaces and said, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”"
Genesis,26,23,"From there he went up to Beer-sheba,"
Genesis,26,24,"and the LORD appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your offspring because of My servant Abraham.”"
Genesis,26,25,"So he built an altar there, called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. Isaac’s slaves also dug a well there."
Genesis,26,26,Now Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
Genesis,26,27,"Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me? You hated me and sent me away from you.”"
Genesis,26,28,"They replied, “We have clearly seen how the LORD has been with you. We think there should be an oath between two parties—between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you:"
Genesis,26,29,"You will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have only done what was good to you, sending you away in peace. You are now blessed by the LORD.”"
Genesis,26,30,"So he prepared a banquet for them, and they ate and drank."
Genesis,26,31,"They got up early in the morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace."
Genesis,26,32,"On that same day Isaac’s slaves came to tell him about the well they had dug, saying to him, “We have found water!”"
Genesis,26,33,He called it Sheba. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
Genesis,26,34,"When Esau was 40 years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite."
Genesis,26,35,They made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis,27,1,"When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could not see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And he answered, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,27,2,"He said, “Look, I am old and do not know the day of my death."
Genesis,27,3,"Take your hunting gear, your quiver and bow, and go out in the field to hunt some game for me."
Genesis,27,4,"Then make me a delicious meal that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I can bless you before I die.”"
Genesis,27,5,"Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac said to his son Esau. So while Esau went to the field to hunt some game to bring in,"
Genesis,27,6,"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Listen! I heard your father talking with your brother Esau. He said,"
Genesis,27,7,‘Bring me the game and make a delicious meal for me to eat so that I can bless you in the LORD’s presence before I die.’
Genesis,27,8,"Now obey every order I give you, my son."
Genesis,27,9,"Go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, and I will make them into a delicious meal for your father—the kind he loves."
Genesis,27,10,Then take it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies.”
Genesis,27,11,"Jacob answered Rebekah his mother, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am a man with smooth skin."
Genesis,27,12,Suppose my father touches me. Then I will be revealed to him as a deceiver and bring a curse rather than a blessing on myself.”
Genesis,27,13,"His mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey me and go get them for me.”"
Genesis,27,14,"So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother, and his mother made the delicious food his father loved."
Genesis,27,15,"Then Rebekah took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were in the house, and had her younger son Jacob wear them."
Genesis,27,16,She put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,Then she handed the delicious food and the bread she had made to her son Jacob.
Genesis,27,18,"When he came to his father, he said, “My father.” And he answered, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”"
Genesis,27,19,"Jacob replied to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may bless me.”"
Genesis,27,20,"But Isaac said to his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?” He replied, “Because the LORD your God worked it out for me.”"
Genesis,27,21,"Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau or not?”"
Genesis,27,22,"So Jacob came closer to his father Isaac. When he touched him, he said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”"
Genesis,27,23,"He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him."
Genesis,27,24,"Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he replied, “I am.”"
Genesis,27,25,"Then he said, “Serve me, and let me eat some of my son’s game so that I can bless you.” Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; he brought him wine, and he drank."
Genesis,27,26,"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come closer and kiss me, my son.”"
Genesis,27,27,"So he came closer and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothes, he blessed him and said: Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed."
Genesis,27,28,May God give to you— from the dew of the sky and from the richness of the land— an abundance of grain and new wine.
Genesis,27,29,"May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers; may your mother’s sons bow down to you. Those who curse you will be cursed, and those who bless you will be blessed."
Genesis,27,30,"As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had left the presence of his father Isaac, his brother Esau arrived from the hunt."
Genesis,27,31,"He had also made some delicious food and brought it to his father. Then he said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, so that you may bless me.”"
Genesis,27,32,"But his father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am Esau your firstborn son.”"
Genesis,27,33,"Isaac began to tremble uncontrollably. “Who was it then,” he said, “who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all before you came in, and I blessed him. Indeed, he will be blessed!”"
Genesis,27,34,"When Esau heard his father’s words, he cried out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, my father!”"
Genesis,27,35,"But he replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”"
Genesis,27,36,"So he said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice now. He took my birthright, and look, now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?”"
Genesis,27,37,"But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have made him a master over you, have given him all of his relatives as his servants, and have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then can I do for you, my son?”"
Genesis,27,38,"Esau said to his father, “Do you only have one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” And Esau wept loudly."
Genesis,27,39,"Then his father Isaac answered him: Look, your dwelling place will be away from the richness of the land, away from the dew of the sky above."
Genesis,27,40,"You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. But when you rebel, you will break his yoke from your neck."
Genesis,27,41,Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau determined in his heart: “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
Genesis,27,42,"When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she summoned her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Listen, your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you."
Genesis,27,43,"So now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran,"
Genesis,27,44,and stay with him for a few days until your brother’s anger subsides—
Genesis,27,45,until your brother’s rage turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose you both in one day?”
Genesis,27,46,"So Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m sick of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like one of them, what good is my life?”"
Genesis,28,1,"Isaac summoned Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him: “Don’t take a wife from the Canaanite women."
Genesis,28,2,"Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father. Marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother."
Genesis,28,3,May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you become an assembly of peoples.
Genesis,28,4,"May God give you and your offspring the blessing of Abraham so that you may possess the land where you live as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”"
Genesis,28,5,"So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau."
Genesis,28,6,"Esau noticed that Isaac blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to get a wife there. When he blessed him, Isaac commanded Jacob, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.”"
Genesis,28,7,And Jacob listened to his father and mother and went to Paddan-aram.
Genesis,28,8,"Esau realized that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women,"
Genesis,28,9,"so Esau went to Ishmael and married, in addition to his other wives, Mahalath daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son. She was the sister of Nebaioth."
Genesis,28,10,Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.
Genesis,28,11,"He reached a certain place and spent the night there because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from the place, put it there at his head, and lay down in that place."
Genesis,28,12,"And he dreamed: A stairway was set on the ground with its top reaching heaven, and God’s angels were going up and down on it."
Genesis,28,13,"Yahweh was standing there beside him, saying, “I am Yahweh, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your offspring the land that you are now sleeping on."
Genesis,28,14,"Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out toward the west, the east, the north, and the south. All the peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring."
Genesis,28,15,"Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”"
Genesis,28,16,"When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.”"
Genesis,28,17,"He was afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! This is none other than the house of God. This is the gate of heaven.”"
Genesis,28,18,Early in the morning Jacob took the stone that was near his head and set it up as a marker. He poured oil on top of it
Genesis,28,19,"and named the place Bethel, though previously the city was named Luz."
Genesis,28,20,"Then Jacob made a vow: “If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey, if He provides me with food to eat and clothing to wear,"
Genesis,28,21,"and if I return safely to my father’s house, then the LORD will be my God."
Genesis,28,22,"This stone that I have set up as a marker will be God’s house, and I will give to You a tenth of all that You give me.”"
Genesis,29,1,Jacob resumed his journey and went to the eastern country.
Genesis,29,2,He looked and saw a well in a field. Three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it because the sheep were watered from this well. A large stone covered the opening of the well.
Genesis,29,3,"When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the opening of the well and water the sheep. The stone was then placed back on the well’s opening."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob asked the men at the well, “My brothers! Where are you from?” “We’re from Haran,” they answered."
Genesis,29,5,"“Do you know Laban grandson of Nahor?” Jacob asked them. They answered, “We know him.”"
Genesis,29,6,"“Is he well?” Jacob asked. “Yes,” they said, “and here is his daughter Rachel, coming with his sheep.”"
Genesis,29,7,"Then Jacob said, “Look, it is still broad daylight. It’s not time for the animals to be gathered. Water the flock, then go out and let them graze.”"
Genesis,29,8,"But they replied, “We can’t until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone is rolled from the well’s opening. Then we will water the sheep.”"
Genesis,29,9,"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
Genesis,29,10,"As soon as Jacob saw his uncle Laban’s daughter Rachel with his sheep, he went up and rolled the stone from the opening and watered his uncle Laban’s sheep."
Genesis,29,11,Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.
Genesis,29,12,"He told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father."
Genesis,29,13,"When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him, hugged him, and kissed him. Then he took him to his house, and Jacob told him all that had happened."
Genesis,29,14,"Laban said to him, “Yes, you are my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him a month,"
Genesis,29,15,"Laban said to him, “Just because you’re my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”"
Genesis,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters: the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,"Leah had ordinary eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful."
Genesis,29,18,"Jacob loved Rachel, so he answered Laban, “I’ll work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”"
Genesis,29,19,"Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay with me.”"
Genesis,29,20,"So Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, and they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her."
Genesis,29,21,"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is completed. I want to sleep with her.”"
Genesis,29,22,So Laban invited all the men of the place to a feast.
Genesis,29,23,"That evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her."
Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave his slave Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her slave.
Genesis,29,25,"When morning came, there was Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Wasn’t it for Rachel that I worked for you? Why have you deceived me?”"
Genesis,29,26,"Laban answered, “It is not the custom in this place to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn."
Genesis,29,27,"Complete this week of wedding celebration, and we will also give you this younger one in return for working yet another seven years for me.”"
Genesis,29,28,"And Jacob did just that. He finished the week of celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife."
Genesis,29,29,And Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.
Genesis,29,30,"Jacob slept with Rachel also, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years."
Genesis,29,31,"When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was unable to conceive."
Genesis,29,32,"Leah conceived, gave birth to a son, and named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has seen my affliction; surely my husband will love me now.”"
Genesis,29,33,"She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, “The LORD heard that I am unloved and has given me this son also.” So she named him Simeon."
Genesis,29,34,"She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, “At last, my husband will become attached to me because I have borne three sons for him.” Therefore he was named Levi."
Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children."
Genesis,30,1,"When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she envied her sister. “Give me sons, or I will die!” she said to Jacob."
Genesis,30,2,"Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld children from you?”"
Genesis,30,3,"Then she said, “Here is my slave Bilhah. Go sleep with her, and she’ll bear children for me so that through her I too can build a family.”"
Genesis,30,4,"So Rachel gave her slave Bilhah to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her."
Genesis,30,5,Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,6,"Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; yes, He has heard me and given me a son,” and she named him Dan."
Genesis,30,7,Rachel’s slave Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis,30,8,"Rachel said, “In my wrestlings with God, I have wrestled with my sister and won,” and she named him Naphtali."
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her slave Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife."
Genesis,30,10,Leah’s slave Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Genesis,30,11,"Then Leah said, “What good fortune!” and she named him Gad."
Genesis,30,12,"When Leah’s slave Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,"
Genesis,30,13,"Leah said, “I am happy that the women call me happy,” so she named him Asher."
Genesis,30,14,"Reuben went out during the wheat harvest and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother Leah, Rachel asked, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,15,"But Leah replied to her, “Isn’t it enough that you have taken my husband? Now you also want to take my son’s mandrakes?” “Well,” Rachel said, “you can sleep with him tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis,30,16,"When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So Jacob slept with her that night."
Genesis,30,17,"God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my slave to my husband,” and she named him Issachar."
Genesis,30,19,Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
Genesis,30,20,"“God has given me a good gift,” Leah said. “This time my husband will honor me because I have borne six sons for him,” and she named him Zebulun."
Genesis,30,21,"Later, Leah bore a daughter and named her Dinah."
Genesis,30,22,Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb.
Genesis,30,23,"She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my shame.”"
Genesis,30,24,She named him Joseph: “May the LORD add another son to me.”
Genesis,30,25,"After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so that I can return to my homeland."
Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children that I have worked for, and let me go. You know how hard I have worked for you.”"
Genesis,30,27,"But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.”"
Genesis,30,28,"Then Laban said, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”"
Genesis,30,29,"So Jacob said to him, “You know what I have done for you and your herds."
Genesis,30,30,"For you had very little before I came, but now your wealth has increased. The LORD has blessed you because of me. And now, when will I also do something for my own family?”"
Genesis,30,31,"Laban asked, “What should I give you?” And Jacob said, “You don’t need to give me anything. If you do this one thing for me, I will continue to shepherd and keep your flock."
Genesis,30,32,"Let me go through all your sheep today and remove every sheep that is speckled or spotted, every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the female goats. Such will be my wages."
Genesis,30,33,"In the future when you come to check on my wages, my honesty will testify for me. If I have any female goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not black, they will be considered stolen.”"
Genesis,30,34,"“Good,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”"
Genesis,30,35,"That day Laban removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats—every one that had any white on it—and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and he placed his sons in charge of them."
Genesis,30,36,"He put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. Jacob, meanwhile, was shepherding the rest of Laban’s flock."
Genesis,30,37,"Jacob then took branches of fresh poplar, almond, and plane wood, and peeled the bark, exposing white stripes on the branches."
Genesis,30,38,He set the peeled branches in the troughs in front of the sheep—in the water channels where the sheep came to drink. And the sheep bred when they came to drink.
Genesis,30,39,"The flocks bred in front of the branches and bore streaked, speckled, and spotted young."
Genesis,30,40,Jacob separated the lambs and made the flocks face the streaked and the completely dark sheep in Laban’s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and didn’t put them with Laban’s sheep.
Genesis,30,41,"Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob placed the branches in the troughs, in full view of the flocks, and they would breed in front of the branches."
Genesis,30,42,"As for the weaklings of the flocks, he did not put out the branches. So it turned out that the weak sheep belonged to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob."
Genesis,30,43,"And the man became very rich. He had many flocks, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis,31,1,Now Jacob heard what Laban’s sons were saying: “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s and has built this wealth from what belonged to our father.”
Genesis,31,2,And Jacob saw from Laban’s face that his attitude toward him was not the same.
Genesis,31,3,"Then the LORD said to him, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will be with you.”"
Genesis,31,4,Jacob had Rachel and Leah called to the field where his flocks were.
Genesis,31,5,"He said to them, “I can see from your father’s face that his attitude toward me is not the same, but the God of my father has been with me."
Genesis,31,6,You know that I’ve worked hard for your father
Genesis,31,7,and that he has cheated me and changed my wages 10 times. But God has not let him harm me.
Genesis,31,8,"If he said, ‘The spotted sheep will be your wages,’ then all the sheep were born spotted. If he said, ‘The streaked sheep will be your wages,’ then all the sheep were born streaked."
Genesis,31,9,God has taken away your father’s herds and given them to me.
Genesis,31,10,"“When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females."
Genesis,31,11,"In that dream the Angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’"
Genesis,31,12,"And He said, ‘Look up and see: all the males that are mating with the flocks are streaked, spotted, and speckled, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you."
Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you poured oil on the stone marker and made a solemn vow to Me. Get up, leave this land, and return to your native land.’”"
Genesis,31,14,"Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “Do we have any portion or inheritance in our father’s household?"
Genesis,31,15,Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? For he has sold us and has certainly spent our money.
Genesis,31,16,"In fact, all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has said to you.”"
Genesis,31,17,Then Jacob got up and put his children and wives on the camels.
Genesis,31,18,"He took all the livestock and possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, and he drove his herds to go to the land of his father Isaac in Canaan."
Genesis,31,19,"When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols."
Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean, not telling him that he was fleeing."
Genesis,31,21,"He fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
Genesis,31,23,"So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him at Mount Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night. “Watch yourself!” God warned him. “Don’t say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”"
Genesis,31,25,"When Laban overtook Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his brothers also pitched their tents in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis,31,26,"Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and taken my daughters away like prisoners of war!"
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you secretly flee from me, deceive me, and not tell me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and lyres,"
Genesis,31,28,but you didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters. You have acted foolishly.
Genesis,31,29,"I could do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me: ‘Watch yourself. Don’t say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’"
Genesis,31,30,Now you have gone off because you long for your father—but why have you stolen my gods?”
Genesis,31,31,"Jacob answered, “I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force."
Genesis,31,32,"If you find your gods with anyone here, he will not live! Before our relatives, point out anything that is yours and take it.” Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols."
Genesis,31,33,"So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, and then the tents of the two female slaves, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s."
Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of the camel, and sat on them. Laban searched the whole tent but found nothing."
Genesis,31,35,"She said to her father, “Sir, don’t be angry that I cannot stand up in your presence; I am having my period.” So Laban searched, but could not find the household idols."
Genesis,31,36,"Then Jacob became incensed and brought charges against Laban. “What is my crime?” he said to Laban. “What is my sin, that you have pursued me?"
Genesis,31,37,"You’ve searched all my possessions! Have you found anything of yours? Put it here before my relatives and yours, and let them decide between the two of us."
Genesis,31,38,"I’ve been with you these 20 years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams from your flock."
Genesis,31,39,I did not bring you any of the flock torn by wild beasts; I myself bore the loss. You demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or by night.
Genesis,31,40,"There I was—the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes."
Genesis,31,41,For 20 years I have worked in your household—14 years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—and you have changed my wages 10 times!
Genesis,31,42,"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, certainly now you would have sent me off empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and my hard work, and He issued His verdict last night.”"
Genesis,31,43,"Then Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters; the sons, my sons; and the flocks, my flocks! Everything you see is mine! But what can I do today for these daughters of mine or for the children they have borne?"
Genesis,31,44,"Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be a witness between the two of us.”"
Genesis,31,45,So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a marker.
Genesis,31,46,"Then Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a mound, then ate there by the mound."
Genesis,31,47,"Laban named the mound Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Galeed."
Genesis,31,48,"Then Laban said, “This mound is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore the place was called Galeed"
Genesis,31,49,"and also Mizpah, for he said, “May the LORD watch between you and me when we are out of each other’s sight."
Genesis,31,50,"If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, though no one is with us, understand that God will be a witness between you and me.”"
Genesis,31,51,"Laban also said to Jacob, “Look at this mound and the marker I have set up between you and me."
Genesis,31,52,"This mound is a witness and the marker is a witness that I will not pass beyond this mound to you, and you will not pass beyond this mound and this marker to do me harm."
Genesis,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the gods of Nahor—the gods of their father—will judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,54,Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. So they ate a meal and spent the night on the mountain.
Genesis,31,55,"Laban got up early in the morning, kissed his grandchildren and daughters, and blessed them. Then Laban left to return home."
Genesis,32,1,"Jacob went on his way, and God’s angels met him."
Genesis,32,2,"When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp.” So he called that place Mahanaim."
Genesis,32,3,"Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
Genesis,32,4,"He commanded them, “You are to say to my lord Esau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob says. I have been staying with Laban and have been delayed until now."
Genesis,32,5,"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male and female slaves. I have sent this message to inform my lord, in order to seek your favor.’”"
Genesis,32,6,"When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau; he is coming to meet you—and he has 400 men with him.”"
Genesis,32,7,"Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; he divided the people with him into two camps, along with the flocks, cattle, and camels."
Genesis,32,8,"He thought, “If Esau comes to one camp and attacks it, the remaining one can escape.”"
Genesis,32,9,"Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said to me, ‘Go back to your land and to your family, and I will cause you to prosper,’"
Genesis,32,10,"I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two camps."
Genesis,32,11,"Please rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid of him; otherwise, he may come and attack me, the mothers, and their children."
Genesis,32,12,"You have said, ‘I will cause you to prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”"
Genesis,32,13,He spent the night there and took part of what he had brought with him as a gift for his brother Esau:
Genesis,32,14,"200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,"
Genesis,32,15,"30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys."
Genesis,32,16,"He entrusted them to his slaves as separate herds and said to them, “Go on ahead of me, and leave some distance between the herds.”"
Genesis,32,17,"And he told the first one: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to? Where are you going? And whose animals are these ahead of you?’"
Genesis,32,18,"then tell him, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And look, he is behind us.’”"
Genesis,32,19,"He also told the second one, the third, and everyone who was walking behind the animals, “Say the same thing to Esau when you find him."
Genesis,32,20,"You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I want to appease Esau with the gift that is going ahead of me. After that, I can face him, and perhaps he will forgive me.”"
Genesis,32,21,So the gift was sent on ahead of him while he remained in the camp that night.
Genesis,32,22,"During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female slaves, and his 11 sons, and crossed the ford of Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,"He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions."
Genesis,32,24,"Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak."
Genesis,32,25,"When the man saw that He could not defeat him, He struck Jacob’s hip socket as they wrestled and dislocated his hip."
Genesis,32,26,"Then He said to Jacob, “Let Me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob said, “I will not let You go unless You bless me.”"
Genesis,32,27,"“What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied."
Genesis,32,28,"“Your name will no longer be Jacob,” He said. “It will be Israel because you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.”"
Genesis,32,29,"Then Jacob asked Him, “Please tell me Your name.” But He answered, “Why do you ask My name?” And He blessed him there."
Genesis,32,30,"Jacob then named the place Peniel, “For I have seen God face to face,” he said, “and I have been delivered.”"
Genesis,32,31,The sun shone on him as he passed by Penuel—limping because of his hip.
Genesis,32,32,"That is why, to this day, the Israelites don’t eat the thigh muscle that is at the hip socket: because He struck Jacob’s hip socket at the thigh muscle."
Genesis,33,1,"Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with 400 men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female slaves."
Genesis,33,2,"He put the female slaves and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last."
Genesis,33,3,He himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times until he approached his brother.
Genesis,33,4,"But Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. Then they wept."
Genesis,33,5,"When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” He answered, “The children God has graciously given your servant.”"
Genesis,33,6,Then the female slaves and their children approached him and bowed down.
Genesis,33,7,"Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down."
Genesis,33,8,"So Esau said, “What do you mean by this whole procession I met?” “To find favor with you, my lord,” he answered."
Genesis,33,9,"“I have enough, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what you have.”"
Genesis,33,10,"But Jacob said, “No, please! If I have found favor with you, take this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing God’s face, since you have accepted me."
Genesis,33,11,"Please take my present that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have everything I need.” So Jacob urged him until he accepted."
Genesis,33,12,"Then Esau said, “Let’s move on, and I’ll go ahead of you.”"
Genesis,33,13,"Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are weak, and I have nursing sheep and cattle. If they are driven hard for one day, the whole herd will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a pace suited to the livestock and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”"
Genesis,33,15,"Esau said, “Let me leave some of my people with you.” But he replied, “Why do that? Please indulge me, my lord.”"
Genesis,33,16,"That day Esau started on his way back to Seir,"
Genesis,33,17,but Jacob went on to Succoth. He built a house for himself and stalls for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth.
Genesis,33,18,"After Jacob came from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at Shechem in the land of Canaan and camped in front of the city."
Genesis,33,19,"He purchased a section of the field where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 qesitahs."
Genesis,33,20,"And he set up an altar there and called it “God, the God of Israel.”"
Genesis,34,1,"Dinah, Leah’s daughter whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see some of the young women of the area."
Genesis,34,2,"When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the region, saw her, he took her and raped her."
Genesis,34,3,"He became infatuated with Dinah, daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke tenderly to her."
Genesis,34,4,"“Get me this girl as a wife,” he told his father Hamor."
Genesis,34,5,"Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent until they returned."
Genesis,34,6,"Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob."
Genesis,34,7,"Jacob’s sons returned from the field when they heard about the incident and were deeply grieved and angry. For Shechem had committed an outrage against Israel by raping Jacob’s daughter, and such a thing should not be done."
Genesis,34,8,"Hamor said to Jacob’s sons, “My son Shechem is strongly attracted to your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife."
Genesis,34,9,"Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves."
Genesis,34,10,"Live with us. The land is before you. Settle here, move about, and acquire property in it.”"
Genesis,34,11,"Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I’ll give you whatever you say."
Genesis,34,12,Demand of me a high compensation and gift; I’ll give you whatever you ask me. Just give the girl to be my wife!”
Genesis,34,13,But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
Genesis,34,14,"“We cannot do this thing,” they said to them. “Giving our sister to an uncircumcised man is a disgrace to us."
Genesis,34,15,We will agree with you only on this condition: if all your males are circumcised as we are.
Genesis,34,16,"Then we will give you our daughters, take your daughters for ourselves, live with you, and become one people."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”"
Genesis,34,18,Their words seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
Genesis,34,19,"The young man did not delay doing this, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most important in all his father’s house."
Genesis,34,20,So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men there.
Genesis,34,21,"“These men are peaceful toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and move about in it, for indeed, the region is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as our wives and give our daughters to them."
Genesis,34,22,But the men will agree to live with us and be one people only on this condition: if all our men are circumcised as they are.
Genesis,34,23,"Won’t their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will live with us.”"
Genesis,34,24,"All the able-bodied men listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and all the able-bodied men were circumcised."
Genesis,34,25,"On the third day, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and killed every male."
Genesis,34,26,"They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went away."
Genesis,34,27,Jacob’s other sons came to the slaughter and plundered the city because their sister had been defiled.
Genesis,34,28,"They took their sheep, cattle, donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field."
Genesis,34,29,"They captured all their possessions, children, and wives and plundered everything in the houses."
Genesis,34,30,"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me, making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”"
Genesis,34,31,"But they answered, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”"
Genesis,35,1,"God said to Jacob, “Get up! Go to Bethel and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”"
Genesis,35,2,"So Jacob said to his family and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your clothes."
Genesis,35,3,We must get up and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to the God who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me everywhere I have gone.”
Genesis,35,4,"Then they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and their earrings, and Jacob hid them under the oak near Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"When they set out, a terror from God came over the cities around them, and they did not pursue Jacob’s sons."
Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob and all who were with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,35,7,Jacob built an altar there and called the place God of Bethel because it was there that God had revealed Himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
Genesis,35,8,"Deborah, the one who had nursed and raised Rebekah, died and was buried under the oak south of Bethel. So Jacob named it Oak of Weeping."
Genesis,35,9,"God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"God said to him: Your name is Jacob; you will no longer be named Jacob, but your name will be Israel. So He named him Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"God also said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation, indeed an assembly of nations, will come from you, and kings will descend from you."
Genesis,35,12,I will give to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac. And I will give the land to your future descendants.
Genesis,35,13,Then God withdrew from him at the place where He had spoken to him.
Genesis,35,14,Jacob set up a marker at the place where He had spoken to him—a stone marker. He poured a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.
Genesis,35,15,Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
Genesis,35,16,"They set out from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult."
Genesis,35,17,"During her difficult labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have another son.”"
Genesis,35,18,"With her last breath—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin."
Genesis,35,19,"So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis,35,20,Jacob set up a marker on her grave; it is the marker at Rachel’s grave to this day.
Genesis,35,21,Israel set out again and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.
Genesis,35,22,"While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had 12 sons:"
Genesis,35,23,"Leah’s sons were Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun."
Genesis,35,24,Rachel’s sons were Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,35,25,The sons of Rachel’s slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
Genesis,35,26,"The sons of Leah’s slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram."
Genesis,35,27,"Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed."
Genesis,35,28,Isaac lived 180 years.
Genesis,35,29,"He took his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
Genesis,36,1,"These are the family records of Esau (that is, Edom)."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives from the Canaanite women: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
Genesis,36,3,and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis,36,4,"Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,"
Genesis,36,5,"and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were Esau’s sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,36,6,"Esau took his wives, sons, daughters, and all the people of his household, as well as his herds, all his livestock, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan; he went to a land away from his brother Jacob."
Genesis,36,7,"For their possessions were too many for them to live together, and because of their herds, the land where they stayed could not support them."
Genesis,36,8,"So Esau (that is, Edom) lived in the mountains of Seir."
Genesis,36,9,"These are the family records of Esau, father of the Edomites in the mountains of Seir."
Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel son of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,11,"The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,"Timna, a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz, bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Adah."
Genesis,36,13,"These are Reuel’s sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,14,"These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon: She bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah to Edom."
Genesis,36,15,"These are the chiefs of Esau’s sons: the sons of Eliphaz, Esau’s firstborn: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,"
Genesis,36,16,"Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah."
Genesis,36,17,"These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath."
Genesis,36,18,"These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs of Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah."
Genesis,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs."
Genesis,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
Genesis,36,21,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom."
Genesis,36,22,The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Timna was Lotan’s sister.
Genesis,36,23,"These are Shobal’s sons: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
Genesis,36,24,These are Zibeon’s sons: Aiah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness while he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
Genesis,36,25,These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
Genesis,36,26,"These are Dishon’s sons: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran."
Genesis,36,27,"These are Ezer’s sons: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan."
Genesis,36,28,These are Dishan’s sons: Uz and Aran.
Genesis,36,29,"These are the chiefs of the Horites: Chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
Genesis,36,30,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir."
Genesis,36,31,These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites:
Genesis,36,32,Bela son of Beor ruled in Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis,36,33,"When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became king in his place."
Genesis,36,34,"When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king in his place."
Genesis,36,35,"When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad became king in his place. He defeated Midian in the field of Moab; the name of his city was Avith."
Genesis,36,36,"When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah became king in his place."
Genesis,36,37,"When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates River became king in his place."
Genesis,36,38,"When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor became king in his place."
Genesis,36,39,"When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar became king in his place. His city was Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred daughter of Me-zahab."
Genesis,36,40,"These are the names of Esau’s chiefs, according to their families and their localities, by their names: Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,"
Genesis,36,41,"Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,"
Genesis,36,42,"Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,"
Genesis,36,43,"Magdiel, and Iram. These are Edom’s chiefs, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. Esau was father of the Edomites."
Genesis,37,1,"Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"These are the family records of Jacob. At 17 years of age, Joseph tended sheep with his brothers. The young man was working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought a bad report about them to their father."
Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because Joseph was a son born to him in his old age, and he made a robe of many colors for him."
Genesis,37,4,"When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him."
Genesis,37,5,"Then Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more."
Genesis,37,6,"He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:"
Genesis,37,7,"There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly my sheaf stood up, and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.”"
Genesis,37,8,“Are you really going to reign over us?” his brothers asked him. “Are you really going to rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said.
Genesis,37,9,"Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun, moon, and 11 stars were bowing down to me.”"
Genesis,37,10,"He told his father and brothers, but his father rebuked him. “What kind of dream is this that you have had?” he said. “Are your mother and brothers and I going to come and bow down to the ground before you?”"
Genesis,37,11,"His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind."
Genesis,37,12,His brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks at Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,"Israel said to Joseph, “Your brothers, you know, are pasturing the flocks at Shechem. Get ready. I’m sending you to them.” “I’m ready,” Joseph replied."
Genesis,37,14,"Then Israel said to him, “Go and see how your brothers and the flocks are doing, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem."
Genesis,37,15,"A man found him there, wandering in the field, and asked him, “What are you looking for?”"
Genesis,37,16,"“I’m looking for my brothers,” Joseph said. “Can you tell me where they are pasturing their flocks?”"
Genesis,37,17,"“They’ve moved on from here,” the man said. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"They saw him in the distance, and before he had reached them, they plotted to kill him."
Genesis,37,19,"They said to one another, “Here comes that dreamer!"
Genesis,37,20,"Come on, let’s kill him and throw him into one of the pits. We can say that a vicious animal ate him. Then we’ll see what becomes of his dreams!”"
Genesis,37,21,"When Reuben heard this, he tried to save him from them. He said, “Let’s not take his life.”"
Genesis,37,22,"Reuben also said to them, “Don’t shed blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him”—intending to rescue him from their hands and return him to his father."
Genesis,37,23,"When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped off his robe, the robe of many colors that he had on."
Genesis,37,24,Then they took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis,37,25,"Then they sat down to eat a meal. They looked up, and there was a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying aromatic gum, balsam, and resin, going down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"Then Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?"
Genesis,37,27,"Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh,” and they agreed."
Genesis,37,28,"When Midianite traders passed by, his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for 20 pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took Joseph to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes."
Genesis,37,30,"He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”"
Genesis,37,31,"So they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the robe in its blood."
Genesis,37,32,"They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it. Is it your son’s robe or not?”"
Genesis,37,33,"His father recognized it. “It is my son’s robe,” he said. “A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has been torn to pieces!”"
Genesis,37,34,"Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days."
Genesis,37,35,"All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said. “I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” And his father wept for him."
Genesis,37,36,"Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard."
Genesis,38,1,At that time Judah left his brothers and settled near an Adullamite named Hirah.
Genesis,38,2,There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite named Shua; he took her as a wife and slept with her.
Genesis,38,3,"She conceived and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er."
Genesis,38,4,"She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and named him Onan."
Genesis,38,5,She gave birth to another son and named him Shelah. It was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.
Genesis,38,6,"Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"Now Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the LORD’s sight, and the LORD put him to death."
Genesis,38,8,"Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife. Perform your duty as her brother-in-law and produce offspring for your brother.”"
Genesis,38,9,"But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he released his semen on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother."
Genesis,38,10,"What he did was evil in the LORD’s sight, so He put him to death also."
Genesis,38,11,"Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He might die too, like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s house."
Genesis,38,12,"After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to Timnah to the sheepshearers."
Genesis,38,13,"Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”"
Genesis,38,14,"So she took off her widow’s clothes, veiled her face, covered herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had grown up, she had not been given to him as a wife."
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"He went over to her and said, “Come, let me sleep with you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me for sleeping with me?”"
Genesis,38,17,"“I will send you a young goat from my flock,” he replied. But she said, “Only if you leave something with me until you send it.”"
Genesis,38,18,"“What should I give you?” he asked. She answered, “Your signet ring, your cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she got pregnant by him."
Genesis,38,19,"She got up and left, then removed her veil and put her widow’s clothes back on."
Genesis,38,20,"When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get back the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her."
Genesis,38,21,"He asked the men of the place, “Where is the cult prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “There has been no cult prostitute here,” they answered."
Genesis,38,22,"So the Adullamite returned to Judah, saying, “I couldn’t find her, and furthermore, the men of the place said, ‘There has been no cult prostitute here.’”"
Genesis,38,23,"Judah replied, “Let her keep the items for herself; otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send this young goat, but you couldn’t find her.”"
Genesis,38,24,"About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law, Tamar, has been acting like a prostitute, and now she is pregnant.” “Bring her out!” Judah said. “Let her be burned to death!”"
Genesis,38,25,"As she was being brought out, she sent her father-in-law this message: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong.” And she added, “Examine them. Whose signet ring, cord, and staff are these?”"
Genesis,38,26,"Judah recognized them and said, “She is more in the right than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know her intimately again."
Genesis,38,27,"When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand, and the midwife took it and tied a scarlet thread around it, announcing, “This one came out first.”"
Genesis,38,29,"But then he pulled his hand back, and his brother came out. Then she said, “You have broken out first!” So he was named Perez."
Genesis,38,30,"Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread tied to his hand, came out, and was named Zerah."
Genesis,39,1,"Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt. An Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there."
Genesis,39,2,"The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master."
Genesis,39,3,"When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made everything he did successful,"
Genesis,39,4,Joseph found favor in his master’s sight and became his personal attendant. Potiphar also put him in charge of his household and placed all that he owned under his authority.
Genesis,39,5,"From the time that he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house because of Joseph. The LORD’s blessing was on all that he owned, in his house and in his fields."
Genesis,39,6,He left all that he owned under Joseph’s authority; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.
Genesis,39,7,"After some time his master’s wife looked longingly at Joseph and said, “Sleep with me.”"
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “with me here my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has put all that he owns under my authority."
Genesis,39,9,"No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?”"
Genesis,39,10,"Although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her."
Genesis,39,11,"Now one day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants were there."
Genesis,39,12,"She grabbed him by his garment and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his garment in her hand, he escaped and ran outside."
Genesis,39,13,"When she saw that he had left his garment with her and had run outside,"
Genesis,39,14,"she called the household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “my husband brought a Hebrew man to make fools of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, and I screamed as loud as I could."
Genesis,39,15,"When he heard me screaming for help, he left his garment with me and ran outside.”"
Genesis,39,16,She put Joseph’s garment beside her until his master came home.
Genesis,39,17,"Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought to us came to make a fool of me,"
Genesis,39,18,"but when I screamed for help, he left his garment with me and ran outside.”"
Genesis,39,19,When his master heard the story his wife told him—“These are the things your slave did to me”—he was furious
Genesis,39,20,"and had him thrown into prison, where the king’s prisoners were confined. So Joseph was there in prison."
Genesis,39,21,But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him. He granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
Genesis,39,22,"The warden put all the prisoners who were in the prison under Joseph’s authority, and he was responsible for everything that was done there."
Genesis,39,23,"The warden did not bother with anything under Joseph’s authority, because the LORD was with him, and the LORD made everything that he did successful."
Genesis,40,1,"After this, the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt."
Genesis,40,2,"Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,"
Genesis,40,3,and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard in the prison where Joseph was confined.
Genesis,40,4,"The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he became their personal attendant. And they were in custody for some time."
Genesis,40,5,"The Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream. Both had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning."
Genesis,40,6,"When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked distraught."
Genesis,40,7,"So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”"
Genesis,40,8,"“We had dreams,” they said to him, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”"
Genesis,40,9,So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph: “In my dream there was a vine in front of me.
Genesis,40,10,"On the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and its clusters ripened into grapes."
Genesis,40,11,"Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”"
Genesis,40,12,"“This is its interpretation,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days."
Genesis,40,13,In just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand the way you used to when you were his cupbearer.
Genesis,40,14,"But when all goes well for you, remember that I was with you. Please show kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison."
Genesis,40,15,"For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.”"
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was positive, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream. Three baskets of white bread were on my head."
Genesis,40,17,"In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”"
Genesis,40,18,"“This is its interpretation,” Joseph replied. “The three baskets are three days."
Genesis,40,19,In just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from off you—and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh from your body.”
Genesis,40,20,"On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he gave a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker."
Genesis,40,21,"Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position as cupbearer, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand."
Genesis,40,22,"But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had explained to them."
Genesis,40,23,Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
Genesis,41,1,"Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile,"
Genesis,41,2,"when seven healthy-looking, well-fed cows came up from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds."
Genesis,41,3,"After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside those cows along the bank of the Nile."
Genesis,41,4,"The sickly, thin cows ate the healthy, well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up."
Genesis,41,5,"He fell asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk."
Genesis,41,6,"After them, seven heads of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up."
Genesis,41,7,"The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh woke up, and it was only a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"When morning came, he was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him."
Genesis,41,9,"Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I remember my faults."
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard."
Genesis,41,11,He and I had dreams on the same night; each dream had its own meaning.
Genesis,41,12,"Now a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guards, was with us there. We told him our dreams, he interpreted our dreams for us, and each had its own interpretation."
Genesis,41,13,"It turned out just the way he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.”"
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they quickly brought him from the dungeon. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it.”"
Genesis,41,16,"“I am not able to,” Joseph answered Pharaoh. “It is God who will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”"
Genesis,41,17,"So Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,"
Genesis,41,18,"when seven well-fed, healthy-looking cows came up from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds."
Genesis,41,19,"After them, seven other cows—ugly, very sickly, and thin—came up. I’ve never seen such ugly ones as these in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,20,"Then the thin, ugly cows ate the first seven well-fed cows."
Genesis,41,21,"When they had devoured them, you could not tell that they had devoured them; their appearance was as bad as it had been before. Then I woke up."
Genesis,41,22,"In my dream I had also seen seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, coming up on one stalk."
Genesis,41,23,"After them, seven heads of grain—withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind—sprouted up."
Genesis,41,24,"The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones. I told this to the magicians, but no one can tell me what it means.”"
Genesis,41,25,"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams mean the same thing. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do."
Genesis,41,26,"The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven ripe heads are seven years. The dreams mean the same thing."
Genesis,41,27,"The seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven worthless, scorched heads of grain are seven years of famine."
Genesis,41,28,“It is just as I told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis,41,29,Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,30,"After them, seven years of famine will take place, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The famine will devastate the land."
Genesis,41,31,"The abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows it, for the famine will be very severe."
Genesis,41,32,"Since the dream was given twice to Pharaoh, it means that the matter has been determined by God, and He will carry it out soon."
Genesis,41,33,"“So now, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,34,Let Pharaoh do this: Let him appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the harvest of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
Genesis,41,35,"Let them gather all the excess food during these good years that are coming. Under Pharaoh’s authority, store the grain in the cities, so they may preserve it as food."
Genesis,41,36,The food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine that will take place in the land of Egypt. Then the country will not be wiped out by the famine.”
Genesis,41,37,The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
Genesis,41,38,"Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find anyone like this, a man who has God’s spirit in him?”"
Genesis,41,39,"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as intelligent and wise as you are."
Genesis,41,40,"You will be over my house, and all my people will obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”"
Genesis,41,41,"Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “See, I am placing you over all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis,41,42,"Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, clothed him with fine linen garments, and placed a gold chain around his neck."
Genesis,41,43,"He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, and servants called out before him, “Abrek!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,44,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but no one will be able to raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt without your permission.”"
Genesis,41,45,"Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah and gave him a wife, Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,46,Joseph was 30 years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt.
Genesis,41,47,During the seven years of abundance the land produced outstanding harvests.
Genesis,41,48,Joseph gathered all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and put it in the cities. He put the food in every city from the fields around it.
Genesis,41,49,So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance—like the sand of the sea—that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.
Genesis,41,50,"Two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine arrived. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On, bore them to him."
Genesis,41,51,"Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, meaning, “God has made me forget all my hardship in my father’s house.”"
Genesis,41,52,"And the second son he named Ephraim, meaning, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”"
Genesis,41,53,"Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end,"
Genesis,41,54,"and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every country, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food."
Genesis,41,55,"Extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh told all Egypt, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”"
Genesis,41,56,"Because the famine had spread across the whole country, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"Every nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe in every land."
Genesis,42,1,"When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you keep looking at each other?"
Genesis,42,2,"Listen,” he went on, “I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us so that we will live and not die.”"
Genesis,42,3,So 10 of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis,42,4,"But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he thought, “Something might happen to him.”"
Genesis,42,5,"The sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,6,Joseph was in charge of the country; he sold grain to all its people. His brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
Genesis,42,7,"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan to buy food,” they replied."
Genesis,42,8,"Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies. You have come to see the weakness of the land.”"
Genesis,42,10,"“No, my lord. Your servants have come to buy food,” they said."
Genesis,42,11,“We are all sons of one man. We are honest; your servants are not spies.”
Genesis,42,12,"“No,” he said to them. “You have come to see the weakness of the land.”"
Genesis,42,13,"But they replied, “We, your servants, were 12 brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no longer living.”"
Genesis,42,14,"Then Joseph said to them, “I have spoken: ‘You are spies!’"
Genesis,42,15,"This is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one from among you to get your brother. The rest of you will be imprisoned so that your words can be tested to see if they are true. If they are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”"
Genesis,42,17,So Joseph imprisoned them together for three days.
Genesis,42,18,"On the third day Joseph said to them, “I fear God—do this and you will live."
Genesis,42,19,"If you are honest, let one of you be confined to the guardhouse, while the rest of you go and take grain to relieve the hunger of your households."
Genesis,42,20,Bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be confirmed; then you won’t die.” And they consented to this.
Genesis,42,21,"Then they said to each other, “Obviously, we are being punished for what we did to our brother. We saw his deep distress when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this trouble has come to us.”"
Genesis,42,22,But Reuben replied: “Didn’t I tell you not to harm the boy? But you wouldn’t listen. Now we must account for his blood!”
Genesis,42,23,"They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them."
Genesis,42,24,He turned away from them and wept. Then he turned back and spoke to them. He took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes.
Genesis,42,25,"Joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain, return each man’s money to his sack, and give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out."
Genesis,42,26,They loaded the grain on their donkeys and left there.
Genesis,42,27,"At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his money there at the top of the bag."
Genesis,42,28,"He said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! It’s here in my bag.” Their hearts sank. Trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”"
Genesis,42,29,"When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them:"
Genesis,42,30,“The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country.
Genesis,42,31,But we told him: We are honest and not spies.
Genesis,42,32,"We were 12 brothers, sons of the same father. One is no longer living, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,42,33,"The man who is the lord of the country said to us, ‘This is how I will know if you are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of your households, and go."
Genesis,42,34,"Bring back your youngest brother to me, and I will know that you are not spies but honest men. I will then give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the country.’”"
Genesis,42,35,"As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his bag of money! When they and their father saw their bags of money, they were afraid."
Genesis,42,36,"Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything happens to me!”"
Genesis,42,37,"Then Reuben said to his father, “You can kill my two sons if I don’t bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him to you.”"
Genesis,42,38,"But Jacob answered, “My son will not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If anything happens to him on your journey, you will bring my gray hairs down to Sheol in sorrow.”"
Genesis,43,1,Now the famine in the land was severe.
Genesis,43,2,"When they had used up the grain they had brought back from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us some food.”"
Genesis,43,3,"But Judah said to him, “The man specifically warned us: ‘You will not see me again unless your brother is with you.’"
Genesis,43,4,"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you."
Genesis,43,5,"But if you will not send him, we will not go, for the man said to us, ‘You will not see me again unless your brother is with you.’”"
Genesis,43,6,“Why did you cause me so much trouble?” Israel asked. “Why did you tell the man that you had another brother?”
Genesis,43,7,"They answered, “The man kept asking about us and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How could we know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”"
Genesis,43,8,"Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me. We will be on our way so that we may live and not die—neither we, nor you, nor our children."
Genesis,43,9,"I will be responsible for him. You can hold me personally accountable! If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, I will be guilty before you forever."
Genesis,43,10,"If we had not wasted time, we could have come back twice by now.”"
Genesis,43,11,"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and take them down to the man as a gift—some balsam and some honey, aromatic gum and resin, pistachios and almonds."
Genesis,43,12,Take twice as much money with you. Return the money that was returned to you in the top of your bags. Perhaps it was a mistake.
Genesis,43,13,"Take your brother also, and go back at once to the man."
Genesis,43,14,"May God Almighty cause the man to be merciful to you so that he will release your other brother and Benjamin to you. As for me, if I am deprived of my sons, then I am deprived.”"
Genesis,43,15,"The men took this gift, double the amount of money, and Benjamin. They made their way down to Egypt and stood before Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his steward, “Take the men to my house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they will eat with me at noon.”"
Genesis,43,17,The man did as Joseph had said and brought them to Joseph’s house.
Genesis,43,18,"But the men were afraid because they were taken to Joseph’s house. They said, “We have been brought here because of the money that was returned in our bags the first time. They intend to overpower us, seize us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys.”"
Genesis,43,19,So they approached Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the doorway of the house.
Genesis,43,20,"They said, “Sir, we really did come down here the first time only to buy food."
Genesis,43,21,"When we came to the place where we lodged for the night and opened our bags of grain, each one’s money was at the top of his bag! It was the full amount of our money, and we have brought it back with us."
Genesis,43,22,We have brought additional money with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in the bags.”
Genesis,43,23,"Then the steward said, “May you be well. Don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bags. I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them."
Genesis,43,24,"The steward brought the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and got feed for their donkeys."
Genesis,43,25,"Since the men had heard that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon."
Genesis,43,26,"When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift they had carried into the house, and they bowed to the ground before him."
Genesis,43,27,"He asked if they were well, and he said, “How is your elderly father that you told me about? Is he still alive?”"
Genesis,43,28,"They answered, “Your servant our father is well. He is still alive.” And they bowed down to honor him."
Genesis,43,29,"When he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother that you told me about?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”"
Genesis,43,30,"Joseph hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother, and he was about to weep. He went into an inner room to weep."
Genesis,43,31,"Then he washed his face and came out. Regaining his composure, he said, “Serve the meal.”"
Genesis,43,32,"They served him by himself, his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, since that is abhorrent to them."
Genesis,43,33,"They were seated before him in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest. The men looked at each other in astonishment."
Genesis,43,34,"Portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, and Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of theirs. They drank, and they got intoxicated with Joseph."
Genesis,44,1,"Then Joseph commanded his steward: “Fill the men’s bags with as much food as they can carry, and put each one’s money at the top of his bag."
Genesis,44,2,"Put my cup, the silver one, at the top of the youngest one’s bag, along with his grain money.” So he did as Joseph told him."
Genesis,44,3,"At morning light, the men were sent off with their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4,"They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Get up. Pursue the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?"
Genesis,44,5,Isn’t this the cup that my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you have done is wrong!’”
Genesis,44,6,"When he overtook them, he said these words to them."
Genesis,44,7,"They said to him, “Why does my lord say these things? Your servants could not possibly do such a thing."
Genesis,44,8,We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found at the top of our bags. How could we steal gold and silver from your master’s house?
Genesis,44,9,"If any of us is found to have it, he must die, and we also will become my lord’s slaves.”"
Genesis,44,10,"The steward replied, “What you have said is right, but only the one who is found to have it will be my slave, and the rest of you will be blameless.”"
Genesis,44,11,So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
Genesis,44,12,"The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack."
Genesis,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his donkey and returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"When Judah and his brothers reached Joseph’s house, he was still there. They fell to the ground before him."
Genesis,44,15,“What is this you have done?” Joseph said to them. “Didn’t you know that a man like me could uncover the truth by divination?”
Genesis,44,16,“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed your servants’ iniquity. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we and the one in whose possession the cup was found.”
Genesis,44,17,"Then Joseph said, “I swear that I will not do this. The man in whose possession the cup was found will be my slave. The rest of you can go in peace to your father.”"
Genesis,44,18,"But Judah approached him and said, “Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, for you are like Pharaoh."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’"
Genesis,44,20,"and we answered my lord, ‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’"
Genesis,44,21,"Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him to me so that I can see him.’"
Genesis,44,22,"But we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’"
Genesis,44,23,"Then you said to your servants, ‘If your younger brother does not come down with you, you will not see me again.’"
Genesis,44,24,“This is what happened when we went back to your servant my father: We reported your words to him.
Genesis,44,25,"But our father said, ‘Go again, and buy us some food.’"
Genesis,44,26,"We told him, ‘We cannot go down unless our younger brother goes with us. So if our younger brother isn’t with us, we cannot see the man.’"
Genesis,44,27,"Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons."
Genesis,44,28,One left—I said that he must have been torn to pieces—and I have never seen him again.
Genesis,44,29,"If you also take this one from me and anything happens to him, you will bring my gray hairs down to Sheol in sorrow.’"
Genesis,44,30,“So if I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us—his life is wrapped up with the boy’s life—
Genesis,44,31,"when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then your servants will have brought the gray hairs of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow."
Genesis,44,32,"Your servant became accountable to my father for the boy, saying, ‘If I do not return him to you, I will always bear the guilt for sinning against you, my father.’"
Genesis,44,33,"Now please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave, in place of the boy. Let him go back with his brothers."
Genesis,44,34,For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could not bear to see the grief that would overwhelm my father.”
Genesis,45,1,"Joseph could no longer keep his composure in front of all his attendants, so he called out, “Send everyone away from me!” No one was with him when he revealed his identity to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and also Pharaoh’s household heard it."
Genesis,45,3,"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But they could not answer him because they were terrified in his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please, come near me,” and they came near. “I am Joseph, your brother,” he said, “the one you sold into Egypt."
Genesis,45,5,"And now don’t be worried or angry with yourselves for selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you to preserve life."
Genesis,45,6,"For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting."
Genesis,45,7,God sent me ahead of you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
Genesis,45,8,"Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"“Return quickly to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay."
Genesis,45,10,"You can settle in the land of Goshen and be near me—you, your children, and grandchildren, your sheep, cattle, and all you have."
Genesis,45,11,"There I will sustain you, for there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise, you, your household, and everything you have will become destitute.”’"
Genesis,45,12,"Look! Your eyes and my brother Benjamin’s eyes can see that it is I , Joseph, who am speaking to you."
Genesis,45,13,Tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and about all you have seen. And bring my father here quickly.”
Genesis,45,14,"Then Joseph threw his arms around Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his shoulder."
Genesis,45,15,"Joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept, and afterward his brothers talked with him."
Genesis,45,16,"When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace, “Joseph’s brothers have come,” Pharaoh and his servants were pleased."
Genesis,45,17,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and go on back to the land of Canaan."
Genesis,45,18,"Get your father and your families, and come back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you can eat from the richness of the land.’"
Genesis,45,19,"You are also commanded, ‘Do this: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your young children and your wives and bring your father here."
Genesis,45,20,"Do not be concerned about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”"
Genesis,45,21,"The sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had commanded, and he gave them provisions for the journey."
Genesis,45,22,"He gave each of the brothers changes of clothes, but he gave Benjamin 300 pieces of silver and five changes of clothes."
Genesis,45,23,"He sent his father the following: 10 donkeys carrying the best products of Egypt and 10 female donkeys carrying grain, food, and provisions for his father on the journey."
Genesis,45,24,"So Joseph sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving, he said to them, “Don’t argue on the way.”"
Genesis,45,25,So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
Genesis,45,26,"They said, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them."
Genesis,45,27,"But when they told Jacob all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived."
Genesis,45,28,"Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go to see him before I die.”"
Genesis,46,1,"Israel set out with all that he had and came to Beer-sheba, and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
Genesis,46,2,"That night God spoke to Israel in a vision: “Jacob, Jacob!” He said. And Jacob replied, “Here I am.”"
Genesis,46,3,"God said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there."
Genesis,46,4,"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back. Joseph will put his hands on your eyes.”"
Genesis,46,5,"Jacob left Beer-sheba. The sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him, along with their children and their wives."
Genesis,46,6,They also took their cattle and possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Then Jacob and all his children went with him to Egypt.
Genesis,46,7,"His sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters, indeed all his offspring, he brought with him to Egypt."
Genesis,46,8,"These are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Jacob’s firstborn: Reuben."
Genesis,46,9,"Reuben’s sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Genesis,46,10,"Simeon’s sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman."
Genesis,46,11,"Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Genesis,46,12,"Judah’s sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. Perez’s sons: Hezron and Hamul."
Genesis,46,13,"Issachar’s sons: Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron."
Genesis,46,14,"Zebulun’s sons: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel."
Genesis,46,15,"These were Leah’s sons born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, as well as his daughter Dinah. The total number of persons: 33."
Genesis,46,16,"Gad’s sons: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli."
Genesis,46,17,"Asher’s sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah’s sons were Heber and Malchiel."
Genesis,46,18,These were the sons of Zilpah—whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah—that she bore to Jacob: 16 persons.
Genesis,46,19,The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis,46,20,"Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt. They were born to him by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, a priest at On."
Genesis,46,21,"Benjamin’s sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard."
Genesis,46,22,These were Rachel’s sons who were born to Jacob: 14 persons.
Genesis,46,23,Dan’s son: Hushim.
Genesis,46,24,"Naphtali’s sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem."
Genesis,46,25,"These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore to Jacob: seven persons."
Genesis,46,26,"The total number of persons belonging to Jacob—his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob’s sons—who came to Egypt: 66."
Genesis,46,27,And Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt: two persons. All those of Jacob’s household who had come to Egypt: 70 persons.
Genesis,46,28,"Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to prepare for his arrival at Goshen. When they came to the land of Goshen,"
Genesis,46,29,"Joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel. Joseph presented himself to him, threw his arms around him, and wept for a long time."
Genesis,46,30,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “At last I can die, now that I have seen your face and know you are still alive!”"
Genesis,46,31,"Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and inform Pharaoh, telling him: My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
Genesis,46,32,The men are shepherds; they also raise livestock. They have brought their sheep and cattle and all that they have.
Genesis,46,33,"When Pharaoh addresses you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’"
Genesis,46,34,"you are to say, ‘Your servants, both we and our fathers, have raised livestock from our youth until now.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen, since all shepherds are abhorrent to Egyptians.”"
Genesis,47,1,"So Joseph went and informed Pharaoh: “My father and my brothers, with their sheep and cattle and all that they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in the land of Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,2,He took five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,"Then Pharaoh asked his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants, both we and our fathers, are shepherds.”"
Genesis,47,4,"Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land for a while because there is no grazing land for your servants’ sheep, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe. So now, please let your servants settle in the land of Goshen.”"
Genesis,47,5,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you,"
Genesis,47,6,"the land of Egypt is open before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. They can live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”"
Genesis,47,7,"Joseph then brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
Genesis,47,8,"Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many years have you lived?”"
Genesis,47,9,"Jacob said to Pharaoh, “My pilgrimage has lasted 130 years. My years have been few and hard, and they have not surpassed the years of my fathers during their pilgrimages.”"
Genesis,47,10,So Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from Pharaoh’s presence.
Genesis,47,11,"Then Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
Genesis,47,12,"And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household with food for their dependents."
Genesis,47,13,"But there was no food in that entire region, for the famine was very severe. The land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted by the famine."
Genesis,47,14,"Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were purchasing, and he brought the money to Pharaoh’s palace."
Genesis,47,15,"When the money from the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die here in front of you? The money is gone!”"
Genesis,47,16,"But Joseph said, “Give me your livestock. Since the money is gone, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”"
Genesis,47,17,"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for the horses, the herds of sheep, the herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock."
Genesis,47,18,"When that year was over, they came the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from our lord that the money is gone and that all our livestock belongs to our lord. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land."
Genesis,47,19,"Why should we die here in front of you—both us and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food. Then we with our land will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed so that we can live and not die, and so that the land won’t become desolate.”"
Genesis,47,20,"In this way, Joseph acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh, because every Egyptian sold his field since the famine was so severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s,"
Genesis,47,21,and Joseph moved the people to the cities from one end of Egypt to the other.
Genesis,47,22,"The only land he didn’t acquire was the priests’ portion, for it was given to them by Pharaoh. They lived off the rations Pharaoh had given them; therefore they did not sell their land."
Genesis,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, “Understand today that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you. Sow it in the land."
Genesis,47,24,"At harvest, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and as food for yourselves, your households, and your dependents.”"
Genesis,47,25,"And they said, “You have saved our lives. We have found favor in our lord’s eyes and will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”"
Genesis,47,26,"So Joseph made it a law, still in effect today in the land of Egypt, that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh."
Genesis,47,27,"Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property in it and became fruitful and very numerous."
Genesis,47,28,"Now Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years, and his life span was 147 years."
Genesis,47,29,"When the time drew near for him to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise me that you will deal with me in kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt."
Genesis,47,30,"When I rest with my fathers, carry me away from Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” Joseph answered, “I will do what you have asked.”"
Genesis,47,31,"And Jacob said, “Swear to me.” So Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed in thanks at the head of his bed."
Genesis,48,1,"Some time after this, Joseph was told, “Your father is weaker.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
Genesis,48,2,"When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed."
Genesis,48,3,"Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me."
Genesis,48,4,"He said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful and numerous; I will make many nations come from you, and I will give this land as an eternal possession to your future descendants.’"
Genesis,48,5,Your two sons born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt are now mine. Ephraim and Manasseh belong to me just as Reuben and Simeon do.
Genesis,48,6,Children born to you after them will be yours and will be recorded under the names of their brothers with regard to their inheritance.
Genesis,48,7,"When I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way, some distance from Ephrath in the land of Canaan. I buried her there along the way to Ephrath,” (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis,48,8,"When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”"
Genesis,48,9,"And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons God has given me here.” So Jacob said, “Bring them to me and I will bless them.”"
Genesis,48,10,"Now his eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought them to him, and he kissed and embraced them."
Genesis,48,11,"Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, but now God has even let me see your offspring.”"
Genesis,48,12,Then Joseph took them from his father’s knees and bowed with his face to the ground.
Genesis,48,13,"Then Joseph took them both—with his right hand Ephraim toward Israel’s left, and with his left hand Manasseh toward Israel’s right—and brought them to Israel."
Genesis,48,14,"But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and crossing his hands, put his left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn."
Genesis,48,15,"Then he blessed Joseph and said: The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,"
Genesis,48,16,"the Angel who has redeemed me from all harm— may He bless these boys. And may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow to be numerous within the land."
Genesis,48,17,"When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he thought it was a mistake and took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s."
Genesis,48,18,"Joseph said to his father, “Not that way, my father! This one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”"
Genesis,48,19,"But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know! He too will become a tribe, and he too will be great; nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a populous nation.”"
Genesis,48,20,"So he blessed them that day with these words: The nation Israel will invoke blessings by you, saying, “May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh,” putting Ephraim before Manasseh."
Genesis,48,21,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers."
Genesis,48,22,"Over and above what I am giving your brothers, I am giving you the one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow.”"
Genesis,49,1,"Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the days to come."
Genesis,49,2,"Come together and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel:"
Genesis,49,3,"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength and the firstfruits of my virility, excelling in prominence, excelling in power."

Genesis,49,5,Simeon and Levi are brothers; their knives are vicious weapons.

Genesis,49,26,"The blessings of your father excel the blessings of my ancestors and the bounty of the eternal hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince of his brothers."
Genesis,49,27,"Benjamin is a wolf; he tears his prey. In the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the plunder.”"
Genesis,49,28,"These are the tribes of Israel, 12 in all, and this was what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing."
Genesis,49,29,Then he commanded them: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
Genesis,49,30,"The cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site."
Genesis,49,31,"Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there, Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there, and I buried Leah there."
Genesis,49,32,The field and the cave in it were purchased from the Hittites.”
Genesis,49,33,"When Jacob had finished instructing his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and died. He was gathered to his people."
Genesis,50,1,"Then Joseph, leaning over his father’s face, wept and kissed him."
Genesis,50,2,He commanded his servants who were physicians to embalm his father. So they embalmed Israel.
Genesis,50,3,"They took 40 days to complete this, for embalming takes that long, and the Egyptians mourned for him 70 days."
Genesis,50,4,"When the days of mourning were over, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s household, “If I have found favor with you, please tell Pharaoh that"
Genesis,50,5,"my father made me take an oath, saying, ‘I am about to die. You must bury me there in the tomb that I made for myself in the land of Canaan.’ Now let me go and bury my father. Then I will return.”"
Genesis,50,6,"So Pharaoh said, “Go and bury your father in keeping with your oath.”"
Genesis,50,7,"Then Joseph went to bury his father, and all Pharaoh’s servants, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt went with him,"
Genesis,50,8,"along with all Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children, their sheep, and their cattle were left in the land of Goshen."
Genesis,50,9,Horses and chariots went up with him; it was a very impressive procession.
Genesis,50,10,"When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they lamented and wept loudly, and Joseph mourned seven days for his father."
Genesis,50,11,"When the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn mourning on the part of the Egyptians.” Therefore the place is named Abel-mizraim. It is across the Jordan."
Genesis,50,12,So Jacob’s sons did for him what he had commanded them.
Genesis,50,13,"They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had purchased as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite."
Genesis,50,14,"After Joseph buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father."
Genesis,50,15,"When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said to one another, “If Joseph is holding a grudge against us, he will certainly repay us for all the suffering we caused him.”"
Genesis,50,16,"So they sent this message to Joseph, “Before he died your father gave a command:"
Genesis,50,17,"‘Say this to Joseph: Please forgive your brothers’ transgression and their sin—the suffering they caused you.’ Therefore, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when their message came to him."
Genesis,50,18,"Then his brothers also came to him, bowed down before him, and said, “We are your slaves!”"
Genesis,50,19,"But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?"
Genesis,50,20,You planned evil against me; God planned it for good to bring about the present result—the survival of many people.
Genesis,50,21,Therefore don’t be afraid. I will take care of you and your little ones.” And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
Genesis,50,22,Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt. Joseph lived 110 years.
Genesis,50,23,He saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation; the sons of Manasseh’s son Machir were recognized by Joseph.
Genesis,50,24,"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will certainly come to your aid and bring you up from this land to the land He promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Genesis,50,25,"So Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath: “When God comes to your aid, you are to carry my bones up from here.”"
Genesis,50,26,Joseph died at the age of 110. They embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt.
Exodus,1,1,These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his family:
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;"
Exodus,1,4,Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
Exodus,1,5,The total number of Jacob’s descendants was 70; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,Then Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died.
Exodus,1,7,"But the Israelites were fruitful, increased rapidly, multiplied, and became extremely numerous so that the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"A new king, who had not known Joseph, came to power in Egypt."
Exodus,1,9,"He said to his people, “Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and powerful than we are."
Exodus,1,10,"Let us deal shrewdly with them; otherwise they will multiply further, and if war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”"
Exodus,1,11,So the Egyptians assigned taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. They built Pithom and Rameses as supply cities for Pharaoh.
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites."
Exodus,1,13,They worked the Israelites ruthlessly
Exodus,1,14,and made their lives bitter with difficult labor in brick and mortar and in all kinds of fieldwork. They ruthlessly imposed all this work on them.
Exodus,1,15,"Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,"
Exodus,1,16,"“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them as they deliver. If the child is a son, kill him, but if it’s a daughter, she may live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"The Hebrew midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live."
Exodus,1,18,"So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this and let the boys live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"The midwives said to Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife can get to them.”"
Exodus,1,20,"So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very numerous."
Exodus,1,21,"Since the midwives feared God, He gave them families."
Exodus,1,22,"Pharaoh then commanded all his people: “You must throw every son born to the Hebrews into the Nile, but let every daughter live.”"
Exodus,2,1,Now a man from the family of Levi married a Levite woman.
Exodus,2,2,"The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son; when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with asphalt and pitch. She placed the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile."
Exodus,2,4,Then his sister stood at a distance in order to see what would happen to him.
Exodus,2,5,"Pharaoh’s daughter went down to bathe at the Nile while her servant girls walked along the riverbank. Seeing the basket among the reeds, she sent her slave girl to get it."
Exodus,2,6,"When she opened it, she saw the child—a little boy, crying. She felt sorry for him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew boys.”"
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a woman from the Hebrews to nurse the boy for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Go,” Pharaoh’s daughter told her. So the girl went and called the boy’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the boy and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, “Because,” she said, “I drew him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"Years later, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people and observed their forced labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people."
Exodus,2,12,"Looking all around and seeing no one, he struck the Egyptian dead and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your neighbor?”"
Exodus,2,14,“Who made you a leader and judge over us?” the man replied. “Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses became afraid and thought: What I did is certainly known.
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
Exodus,2,17,"Then some shepherds arrived and drove them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"When they returned to their father Reuel he asked, “Why have you come back so quickly today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,“So where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why then did you leave the man behind? Invite him to eat dinner.”
Exodus,2,21,"Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage."
Exodus,2,22,"She gave birth to a son whom he named Gershom, for he said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned because of their difficult labor, and they cried out; and their cry for help ascended to God because of the difficult labor."
Exodus,2,24,"So God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"God saw the Israelites, and He took notice."
Exodus,3,1,"Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,"Then the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire within a bush. As Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,So Moses thought: I must go over and look at this remarkable sight. Why isn’t the bush burning up?
Exodus,3,4,"When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from the bush, “Moses, Moses!” “Here I am,” he answered."
Exodus,3,5,"“Do not come closer,” He said. “Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"Then He continued, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of My people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I know about their sufferings."
Exodus,3,8,"I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the territory of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"The Israelites’ cry for help has come to Me, and I have also seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them."
Exodus,3,10,"Therefore, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses asked God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"He answered, “I will certainly be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will all worship God at this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Then Moses asked God, “If I go to the Israelites and say to them: The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ what should I tell them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"God replied to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.”"
Exodus,3,15,"God also said to Moses, “Say this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation."
Exodus,3,16,"“Go and assemble the elders of Israel and say to them: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I have paid close attention to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt."
Exodus,3,17,"And I have promised you that I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey."
Exodus,3,18,"They will listen to what you say. Then you, along with the elders of Israel, must go to the king of Egypt and say to him: Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God."
Exodus,3,19,"“However, I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, unless he is forced by a strong hand."
Exodus,3,20,"I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles that I will perform in it. After that, he will let you go."
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give these people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you go, you will not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"Each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,4,1,"Then Moses answered, “What if they won’t believe me and will not obey me but say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you’?”"
Exodus,4,2,"The LORD asked him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied."
Exodus,4,3,"Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses ran from it,"
Exodus,4,4,"but the LORD told him, “Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail.” So he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand."
Exodus,4,5,"“This will take place,” He continued, “so they will believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”"
Exodus,4,6,"In addition the LORD said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was diseased, white as snow."
Exodus,4,7,"Then He said, “Put your hand back inside your cloak.” He put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it had again become like the rest of his skin."
Exodus,4,8,"“If they will not believe you and will not respond to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign."
Exodus,4,9,"And if they don’t believe even these two signs or listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.”"
Exodus,4,10,"But Moses replied to the LORD, “Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent—either in the past or recently or since You have been speaking to Your servant—because I am slow and hesitant in speech.”"
Exodus,4,11,"Yahweh said to him, “Who made the human mouth? Who makes him mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?"
Exodus,4,12,Now go! I will help you speak and I will teach you what to say.”
Exodus,4,13,"Moses said, “Please, Lord, send someone else.”"
Exodus,4,14,"Then the LORD’s anger burned against Moses, and He said, “Isn’t Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, he is on his way now to meet you. He will rejoice when he sees you."
Exodus,4,15,You will speak with him and tell him what to say. I will help both you and him to speak and will teach you both what to do.
Exodus,4,16,"He will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and you will serve as God to him."
Exodus,4,17,And take this staff in your hand that you will perform the signs with.”
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me return to my relatives in Egypt and see if they are still living.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"Now in Midian the LORD told Moses, “Return to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,"So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took God’s staff in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"The LORD instructed Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, make sure you do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put within your power. But I will harden his heart so that he won’t let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,Then you will say to Pharaoh: This is what Yahweh says: Israel is My firstborn son.
Exodus,4,23,"I told you: Let My son go so that he may worship Me, but you refused to let him go. Now I will kill your firstborn son!”"
Exodus,4,24,"On the trip, at an overnight campsite, it happened that the LORD confronted him and sought to put him to death."
Exodus,4,25,"So Zipporah took a flint, cut off her son’s foreskin, and threw it at Moses’ feet. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me!”"
Exodus,4,26,"So He let him alone. At that time she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” referring to the circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"Now the LORD had said to Aaron, “Go and meet Moses in the wilderness.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and about all the signs He had commanded him to do."
Exodus,4,29,Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites.
Exodus,4,30,Aaron repeated everything the LORD had said to Moses and performed the signs before the people.
Exodus,4,31,"The people believed, and when they heard that the LORD had paid attention to them and that He had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"Later, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Let My people go, so that they may hold a festival for Me in the wilderness.”"
Exodus,5,2,"But Pharaoh responded, “Who is Yahweh that I should obey Him by letting Israel go? I do not know anything about Yahweh, and besides, I will not let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"Then they answered, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God, or else He may strike us with plague or sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"The king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you causing the people to neglect their work? Get to your work!”"
Exodus,5,5,"Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are so numerous, and you would stop them from working.”"
Exodus,5,6,That day Pharaoh commanded the overseers of the people as well as their foremen:
Exodus,5,7,"“Don’t continue to supply the people with straw for making bricks, as before. They must go and gather straw for themselves."
Exodus,5,8,"But require the same quota of bricks from them as they were making before; do not reduce it. For they are slackers—that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,Impose heavier work on the men. Then they will be occupied with it and not pay attention to deceptive words.”
Exodus,5,10,"So the overseers and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am not giving you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go get straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but there will be no reduction at all in your workload.’”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus,5,13,"The overseers insisted, “Finish your assigned work each day, just as you did when straw was provided.”"
Exodus,5,14,"Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s slave drivers had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why haven’t you finished making your prescribed number of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?”"
Exodus,5,15,So the Israelite foremen went in and cried for help to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way?
Exodus,5,16,"No straw has been given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but it is your own people who are at fault.”"
Exodus,5,17,"But he said, “You are slackers. Slackers! That is why you are saying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to the LORD.’"
Exodus,5,18,"Now get to work. No straw will be given to you, but you must produce the same quantity of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"The Israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You cannot reduce your daily quota of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,20,"When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them."
Exodus,5,21,"“May the LORD take note of you and judge,” they said to them, “because you have made us reek in front of Pharaoh and his officials—putting a sword in their hand to kill us!”"
Exodus,5,22,"So Moses went back to the LORD and asked, “Lord, why have You caused trouble for this people? And why did You ever send me?"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I went in to Pharaoh to speak in Your name he has caused trouble for this people, and You haven’t delivered Your people at all.”"
Exodus,6,1,"But the LORD replied to Moses, “Now you are going to see what I will do to Pharaoh: he will let them go because of My strong hand; he will drive them out of his land because of My strong hand.”"
Exodus,6,2,"Then God spoke to Moses, telling him, “I am Yahweh."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I did not reveal My name Yahweh to them."
Exodus,6,4,"I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land they lived in as foreigners."
Exodus,6,5,"Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are forcing to work as slaves, and I have remembered My covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"“Therefore tell the Israelites: I am Yahweh, and I will deliver you from the forced labor of the Egyptians and free you from slavery to them. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great acts of judgment."
Exodus,6,7,"I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am Yahweh your God, who delivered you from the forced labor of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"I will bring you to the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.”"
Exodus,6,9,"Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their broken spirit and hard labor."
Exodus,6,10,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses,"
Exodus,6,11,“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go from his land.”
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses said in the LORD’s presence: “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am such a poor speaker?”"
Exodus,6,13,Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them commands concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers’ families: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These are the clans of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the clans of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogy: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their clans."
Exodus,6,18,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their genealogy.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. She bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the clans of the Korahites."
Exodus,6,25,Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the Levite families by their clans.
Exodus,6,26,"It was this Aaron and Moses whom the LORD told, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt according to their divisions.”"
Exodus,6,27,Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
Exodus,6,28,"On the day the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"He said to him, “I am Yahweh; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I am telling you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses replied in the LORD’s presence, “Since I am such a poor speaker, how will Pharaoh listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"The LORD answered Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,You must say whatever I command you; then Aaron your brother must declare it to Pharaoh so that he will let the Israelites go from his land.
Exodus,7,3,But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,7,4,"Pharaoh will not listen to you, but I will put My hand on Egypt and bring the divisions of My people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment."
Exodus,7,5,"The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch out My hand against Egypt, and bring out the Israelites from among them.”"
Exodus,7,6,So Moses and Aaron did this; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
Exodus,7,7,Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh tells you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh. It will become a serpent.’”"
Exodus,7,10,"So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent."
Exodus,7,11,"But then Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers—the magicians of Egypt, and they also did the same thing by their occult practices."
Exodus,7,12,"Each one threw down his staff, and it became a serpent. But Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs."
Exodus,7,13,"However, Pharaoh’s heart hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hard: he refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning. When you see him walking out to the water, stand ready to meet him by the bank of the Nile. Take in your hand the staff that turned into a snake."
Exodus,7,16,"Tell him: Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me in the wilderness, but so far you have not listened."
Exodus,7,17,"This is what Yahweh says: Here is how you will know that I am Yahweh. Watch. I will strike the water in the Nile with the staff in my hand, and it will turn to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from it.”"
Exodus,7,19,"So the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, canals, ponds, and all their water reservoirs—and they will become blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.”"
Exodus,7,20,"Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded; in the sight of Pharaoh and his officials, he raised the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile was turned to blood."
Exodus,7,21,"The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad the Egyptians could not drink water from it. There was blood throughout the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"But the magicians of Egypt did the same thing by their occult practices. So Pharaoh’s heart hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,7,23,"Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and didn’t even take this to heart."
Exodus,7,24,All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink the water from the river.
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
Exodus,8,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and tell him: This is what Yahweh says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me."
Exodus,8,2,"But if you refuse to let them go, then I will plague all your territory with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"The Nile will swarm with frogs; they will come up and go into your palace, into your bedroom and on your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls."
Exodus,8,4,"The frogs will come up on you, your people, and all your officials.”"
Exodus,8,5,"The LORD then said to Moses, “Tell Aaron: Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, canals, and ponds, and cause the frogs to come up onto the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,8,6,"When Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,But the magicians did the same thing by their occult practices and brought frogs up onto the land of Egypt.
Exodus,8,8,"Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Ask Yahweh to remove the frogs from me and my people. Then I will let the people go and they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”"
Exodus,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, “You make the choice rather than me. When should I ask on behalf of you, your officials, and your people, that the frogs be taken away from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile?”"
Exodus,8,10,"“Tomorrow,” he answered. Moses replied, “As you have said, so you may know there is no one like Yahweh our God,"
Exodus,8,11,"the frogs will go away from you, your houses, your officials, and your people. The frogs will remain only in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,12,"After Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD for help concerning the frogs that He had brought against Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"The LORD did as Moses had said: the frogs in the houses, courtyards, and fields died."
Exodus,8,14,"They piled them in countless heaps, and there was a terrible odor in the land."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and it will become gnats throughout the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,8,17,"And they did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and when he struck the dust of the earth, gnats were on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats throughout the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"The magicians tried to produce gnats using their occult practices, but they could not. The gnats remained on man and beast."
Exodus,8,19,"“This is the finger of God,” the magicians said to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh’s heart hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,20,"The LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh when you see him going out to the water. Tell him: This is what Yahweh says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me."
Exodus,8,21,"But if you will not let My people go, then I will send swarms of flies against you, your officials, your people, and your houses. The Egyptians’ houses will swarm with flies, and so will the land where they live."
Exodus,8,22,"But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen, where My people are living; no flies will be there. This way you will know that I, Yahweh, am in the land."
Exodus,8,23,I will make a distinction between My people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.”
Exodus,8,24,And the LORD did this. Thick swarms of flies went into Pharaoh’s palace and his officials’ houses. Throughout Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies.
Exodus,8,25,"Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go sacrifice to your God within the country.”"
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses said, “It would not be right to do that, because what we will sacrifice to the LORD our God is detestable to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what the Egyptians detest in front of them, won’t they stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,We must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He instructs us.”
Exodus,8,28,"Pharaoh responded, “I will let you go and sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but don’t go very far. Make an appeal for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"“As soon as I leave you,” Moses said, “I will appeal to the LORD, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceptively again by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,30,Then Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the LORD.
Exodus,8,31,"The LORD did as Moses had said: He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people; not one was left."
Exodus,8,32,But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go.
Exodus,9,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and say to him: This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me."
Exodus,9,2,"But if you refuse to let them go and keep holding them,"
Exodus,9,3,"then the LORD’s hand will bring a severe plague against your livestock in the field—the horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks."
Exodus,9,4,"But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that the Israelites own will die.”"
Exodus,9,5,"And the LORD set a time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,"The LORD did this the next day. All the Egyptian livestock died, but none among the Israelite livestock died."
Exodus,9,7,"Pharaoh sent messengers who saw that not a single one of the Israelite livestock was dead. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of furnace soot, and Moses is to throw it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,It will become fine dust over the entire land of Egypt. It will become festering boils on man and beast throughout the land of Egypt.”
Exodus,9,10,"So they took furnace soot and stood before Pharaoh. Moses threw it toward heaven, and it became festering boils on man and beast."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had told Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh. Tell him: This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me."
Exodus,9,14,"Otherwise, I am going to send all My plagues against you, your officials, and your people. Then you will know there is no one like Me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"By now I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague, and you would have been obliterated from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"However, I have let you live for this purpose: to show you My power and to make My name known in all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,You are still acting arrogantly against My people by not letting them go.
Exodus,9,18,Tomorrow at this time I will rain down the worst hail that has ever occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
Exodus,9,19,Therefore give orders to bring your livestock and all that you have in the field into shelters. Every person and animal that is in the field and not brought inside will die when the hail falls on them.”
Exodus,9,20,"Those among Pharaoh’s officials who feared the word of the LORD made their servants and livestock flee to shelters,"
Exodus,9,21,but those who didn’t take the LORD’s word seriously left their servants and livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven and let there be hail throughout the land of Egypt—on man and beast and every plant of the field in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail. Lightning struck the earth, and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"The hail, with lightning flashing through it, was so severe that nothing like it had occurred in the land of Egypt since it had become a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail struck down everything in the field, both man and beast. The hail beat down every plant of the field and shattered every tree in the field."
Exodus,9,26,The only place it didn’t hail was in the land of Goshen where the Israelites were.
Exodus,9,27,"Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. “I have sinned this time,” he said to them. “Yahweh is the Righteous One, and I and my people are the guilty ones."
Exodus,9,28,Make an appeal to Yahweh. There has been enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t need to stay any longer.”
Exodus,9,29,"Moses said to him, “When I have left the city, I will extend my hands to Yahweh. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know the earth belongs to Yahweh."
Exodus,9,30,"But as for you and your officials, I know that you still do not fear Yahweh our God.”"
Exodus,9,31,"The flax and the barley were destroyed because the barley was ripe and the flax was budding,"
Exodus,9,32,but the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed since they are later crops.
Exodus,9,33,"Moses went out from Pharaoh and the city, and extended his hands to the LORD. Then the thunder and hail ceased, and rain no longer poured down on the land."
Exodus,9,34,"When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his officials."
Exodus,9,35,"So Pharaoh’s heart hardened, and he did not let the Israelites go, as the LORD had said through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may do these miraculous signs of Mine among them,"
Exodus,10,2,"and so that you may tell your son and grandson how severely I dealt with the Egyptians and performed miraculous signs among them, and you will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may worship Me."
Exodus,10,4,"But if you refuse to let My people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory."
Exodus,10,5,They will cover the surface of the land so that no one will be able to see the land. They will eat the remainder left to you that escaped the hail; they will eat every tree you have growing in the fields.
Exodus,10,6,"They will fill your houses, all your officials’ houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians—something your fathers and ancestors never saw since the time they occupied the land until today.” Then he turned and left Pharaoh’s presence."
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh’s officials asked him, “How long must this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, so that they may worship Yahweh their God. Don’t you realize yet that Egypt is devastated?”"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship Yahweh your God,” Pharaoh said. “But exactly who will be going?”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moses replied, “We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds because we must hold Yahweh’s festival.”"
Exodus,10,10,"He said to them, “May Yahweh be with you if I ever let you and your families go! Look out—you are planning evil."
Exodus,10,11,"No, only the men may go and worship Yahweh, for that is what you have been asking for.” And they were driven from Pharaoh’s presence."
Exodus,10,12,"The LORD then said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt and the locusts will come up over it and eat every plant in the land, everything that the hail left.”"
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD sent an east wind over the land all that day and through the night. By morning the east wind had brought in the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"The locusts went up over the entire land of Egypt and settled on the whole territory of Egypt. Never before had there been such a large number of locusts, and there never will be again."
Exodus,10,15,"They covered the surface of the whole land so that the land was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green was left on the trees or the plants in the field throughout the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Pharaoh urgently sent for Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"Please forgive my sin once more and make an appeal to Yahweh your God, so that He will take this death away from me.”"
Exodus,10,18,Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"Then the LORD changed the wind to a strong west wind, and it carried off the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the territory of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,21,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be felt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"One person could not see another, and for three days they did not move from where they were. Yet all the Israelites had light where they lived."
Exodus,10,24,"Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship Yahweh. Even your families may go with you; only your flocks and herds must stay behind.”"
Exodus,10,25,"Moses responded, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to prepare for Yahweh our God."
Exodus,10,26,Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind because we will take some of them to worship Yahweh our God. We will not know what we will use to worship Yahweh until we get there.”
Exodus,10,27,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"Pharaoh said to him, “Leave me! Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.”"
Exodus,10,29,"“As you have said,” Moses replied, “I will never see your face again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will drive you out of here."
Exodus,11,2,Now announce to the people that both men and women should ask their neighbors for silver and gold jewelry.”
Exodus,11,3,The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And the man Moses was highly regarded in the land of Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and the people.
Exodus,11,4,"So Moses said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt,"
Exodus,11,5,"and every firstborn male in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the servant girl who is behind the millstones, as well as every firstborn of the livestock."
Exodus,11,6,"Then there will be a great cry of anguish through all the land of Egypt such as never was before, or ever will be again."
Exodus,11,7,"But against all the Israelites, whether man or beast, not even a dog will snarl, so that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel."
Exodus,11,8,"All these officials of yours will come down to me and bow before me, saying: Leave, you and all the people who follow you. After that, I will leave.’” And he left Pharaoh’s presence in fierce anger."
Exodus,11,9,"The LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his land."
Exodus,12,1,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:
Exodus,12,2,“This month is to be the beginning of months for you; it is the first month of your year.
Exodus,12,3,"Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they must each select an animal of the flock according to their fathers’ households, one animal per household."
Exodus,12,4,"If the household is too small for a whole animal, that person and the neighbor nearest his house are to select one based on the combined number of people; you should apportion the animal according to what each person will eat."
Exodus,12,5,"You must have an unblemished animal, a year-old male; you may take it from either the sheep or the goats."
Exodus,12,6,You are to keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight.
Exodus,12,7,They must take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses where they eat them.
Exodus,12,8,"They are to eat the meat that night; they should eat it, roasted over the fire along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Exodus,12,9,"Do not eat any of it raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over fire—its head as well as its legs and inner organs."
Exodus,12,10,Do not let any of it remain until morning; you must burn up any part of it that does remain before morning.
Exodus,12,11,"Here is how you must eat it: you must be dressed for travel, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in a hurry; it is the LORD’s Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"“I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and strike every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. I am Yahweh; I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt."
Exodus,12,13,"The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a distinguishing mark for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will be among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,"“This day is to be a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to the LORD. You are to celebrate it throughout your generations as a permanent statute."
Exodus,12,15,You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day you must remove yeast from your houses. Whoever eats what is leavened from the first day through the seventh day must be cut off from Israel.
Exodus,12,16,You are to hold a sacred assembly on the first day and another sacred assembly on the seventh day. No work may be done on those days except for preparing what people need to eat—you may do only that.
Exodus,12,17,“You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread because on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt. You must observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent statute.
Exodus,12,18,"You are to eat unleavened bread in the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day of the month until the evening of the twenty-first day."
Exodus,12,19,"Yeast must not be found in your houses for seven days. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a foreign resident or native of the land, must be cut off from the community of Israel."
Exodus,12,20,Do not eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes.”
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select an animal from the flock according to your families, and slaughter the Passover animal."
Exodus,12,22,"Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and brush the lintel and the two doorposts with some of the blood in the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning."
Exodus,12,23,"When the LORD passes through to strike Egypt and sees the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, He will pass over the door and not let the destroyer enter your houses to strike you."
Exodus,12,24,“Keep this command permanently as a statute for you and your descendants.
Exodus,12,25,"When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as He promised, you are to observe this ritual."
Exodus,12,26,"When your children ask you, ‘What does this ritual mean to you?’"
Exodus,12,27,"you are to reply, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, for He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and spared our homes.’” So the people bowed down and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,Then the Israelites went and did this; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,29,"Now at midnight the LORD struck every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and every firstborn of the livestock."
Exodus,12,30,"During the night Pharaoh got up, he along with all his officials and all the Egyptians, and there was a loud wailing throughout Egypt because there wasn’t a house without someone dead."
Exodus,12,31,"He summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said, “Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites, and go, worship Yahweh as you have asked."
Exodus,12,32,"Take even your flocks and your herds as you asked and leave, and also bless me.”"
Exodus,12,33,"Now the Egyptians pressured the people in order to send them quickly out of the country, for they said, “We’re all going to die!”"
Exodus,12,34,"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their clothes on their shoulders."
Exodus,12,35,The Israelites acted on Moses’ word and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
Exodus,12,36,And the LORD gave the people such favor in the Egyptians’ sight that they gave them what they requested. In this way they plundered the Egyptians.
Exodus,12,37,"The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 soldiers on foot, besides their families."
Exodus,12,38,"An ethnically diverse crowd also went up with them, along with a huge number of livestock, both flocks and herds."
Exodus,12,39,"The people baked the dough they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves, since it had no yeast; for when they had been driven out of Egypt they could not delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,The time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years.
Exodus,12,41,"At the end of 430 years, on that same day, all the LORD’s divisions went out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"It was a night of vigil in honor of the LORD, because He would bring them out of the land of Egypt. This same night is in honor of the LORD, a night vigil for all the Israelites throughout their generations."
Exodus,12,43,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner may eat it."
Exodus,12,44,"But any slave a man has purchased may eat it, after you have circumcised him."
Exodus,12,45,A temporary resident or hired hand may not eat the Passover.
Exodus,12,46,"It is to be eaten in one house. You may not take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break any of its bones."
Exodus,12,47,The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
Exodus,12,48,"If a foreigner resides with you and wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover, every male in his household must be circumcised, and then he may participate; he will become like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat it."
Exodus,12,49,The same law will apply to both the native and the foreigner who resides among you.”
Exodus,12,50,Then all the Israelites did this; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,51,On that same day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt according to their divisions.
Exodus,13,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Exodus,13,2,"“Consecrate every firstborn male to Me, the firstborn from every womb among the Israelites, both man and domestic animal; it is Mine.”"
Exodus,13,3,"Then Moses said to the people, “Remember this day when you came out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, for the LORD brought you out of here by the strength of His hand. Nothing leavened may be eaten."
Exodus,13,4,"Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving."
Exodus,13,5,"When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you must carry out this ritual in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"For seven days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to the LORD."
Exodus,13,7,"Unleavened bread is to be eaten for those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, and no yeast may be found among you in all your territory."
Exodus,13,8,"On that day explain to your son, ‘This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"Let it serve as a sign for you on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the LORD’s instruction may be in your mouth; for the LORD brought you out of Egypt with a strong hand."
Exodus,13,10,Keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
Exodus,13,11,"“When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,"
Exodus,13,12,you are to present to the LORD every firstborn male of the womb. All firstborn offspring of the livestock you own that are males will be the LORD’s.
Exodus,13,13,"You must redeem every firstborn of a donkey with a flock animal, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. However, you must redeem every firstborn among your sons."
Exodus,13,14,"“In the future, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘By the strength of His hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Exodus,13,15,"When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of livestock. That is why I sacrifice to the LORD all the firstborn of the womb that are males, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.’"
Exodus,13,16,"So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand.”"
Exodus,13,17,"When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road to the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearby; for God said, “The people will change their minds and return to Egypt if they face war.”"
Exodus,13,18,So He led the people around toward the Red Sea along the road of the wilderness. And the Israelites left the land of Egypt in battle formation.
Exodus,13,19,"Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, because Joseph had made the Israelites swear a solemn oath, saying, “God will certainly come to your aid; then you must take my bones with you from this place.”"
Exodus,13,20,They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus,13,21,"The LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to lead them on their way during the day and in a pillar of fire to give them light at night, so that they could travel day or night."
Exodus,13,22,The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never left its place in front of the people.
Exodus,14,1,Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
Exodus,14,2,"“Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you must camp in front of Baal-zephon, facing it by the sea."
Exodus,14,3,Pharaoh will say of the Israelites: They are wandering around the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.
Exodus,14,4,"I will harden Pharaoh’s heart so that he will pursue them. Then I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.” So the Israelites did this."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people and said: “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.”"
Exodus,14,6,So he got his chariot ready and took his troops with him;
Exodus,14,7,"he took 600 of the best chariots and all the rest of the chariots of Egypt, with officers in each one."
Exodus,14,8,"The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the Israelites, who were going out triumphantly."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, his horsemen, and his army—chased after them and caught up with them as they camped by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians coming after them. Then the Israelites were terrified and cried out to the LORD for help."
Exodus,14,11,They said to Moses: “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
Exodus,14,12,Isn’t this what we told you in Egypt: Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
Exodus,14,13,"But Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand firm and see the LORD’s salvation He will provide for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again."
Exodus,14,14,The LORD will fight for you; you must be quiet.”
Exodus,14,15,"The LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to break camp."
Exodus,14,16,"As for you, lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground."
Exodus,14,17,"I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them, and I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh, all his army, and his chariots and horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I receive glory through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,"Then the Angel of God, who was going in front of the Israelite forces, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and stood behind them."
Exodus,14,20,"It came between the Egyptian and Israelite forces. The cloud was there in the darkness, yet it lit up the night. So neither group came near the other all night long."
Exodus,14,21,"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The LORD drove the sea back with a powerful east wind all that night and turned the sea into dry land. So the waters were divided,"
Exodus,14,22,"and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with the waters like a wall to them on their right and their left."
Exodus,14,23,"The Egyptians set out in pursuit—all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen—and went into the sea after them."
Exodus,14,24,"Then during the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the Egyptian forces from the pillar of fire and cloud, and threw them into confusion."
Exodus,14,25,"He caused their chariot wheels to swerve and made them drive with difficulty. “Let’s get away from Israel,” the Egyptians said, “because Yahweh is fighting for them against Egypt!”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back on the Egyptians, on their chariots and horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,"So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal depth. While the Egyptians were trying to escape from it, the LORD threw them into the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The waters came back and covered the chariots and horsemen, the entire army of Pharaoh, that had gone after them into the sea. None of them survived."
Exodus,14,29,"But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with the waters like a wall to them on their right and their left."
Exodus,14,30,"That day the LORD saved Israel from the power of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore."
Exodus,14,31,"When Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and believed in Him and in His servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD. They said: I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"The LORD is my strength and my song; He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise Him, my father’s God, and I will exalt Him."
Exodus,15,3,The LORD is a warrior; Yahweh is His name.
Exodus,15,4,He threw Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea; the elite of his officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The floods covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"LORD, Your right hand is glorious in power. LORD, Your right hand shattered the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,You overthrew Your adversaries by Your great majesty. You unleashed Your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble.
Exodus,15,8,The waters heaped up at the blast of Your nostrils; the currents stood firm like a dam. The watery depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy said: “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My desire will be gratified at their expense. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.”"
Exodus,15,10,"But You blew with Your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"LORD, who is like You among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, revered with praises, performing wonders?"
Exodus,15,12,"You stretched out Your right hand, and the earth swallowed them."
Exodus,15,13,You will lead the people You have redeemed with Your faithful love; You will guide them to Your holy dwelling with Your strength.
Exodus,15,14,"When the peoples hear, they will shudder; anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia."
Exodus,15,15,Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified; trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; the inhabitants of Canaan will panic;
Exodus,15,16,"and terror and dread will fall on them. They will be as still as a stone because of Your powerful arm until Your people pass by, LORD, until the people whom You purchased pass by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of Your possession; LORD, You have prepared the place for Your dwelling; Lord, Your hands have established the sanctuary."
Exodus,15,18,The LORD will reign forever and ever!
Exodus,15,19,"When Pharaoh’s horses with his chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground."
Exodus,15,20,"Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with their tambourines and danced."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam sang to them: Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea."
Exodus,15,22,"Then Moses led Israel on from the Red Sea, and they went out to the Wilderness of Shur. They journeyed for three days in the wilderness without finding water."
Exodus,15,23,"They came to Marah, but they could not drink the water at Marah because it was bitter—that is why it was named Marah."
Exodus,15,24,"The people grumbled to Moses, “What are we going to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"So he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became drinkable. He made a statute and ordinance for them at Marah and He tested them there."
Exodus,15,26,"He said, “If you will carefully obey the LORD your God, do what is right in His eyes, pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, I will not inflict any illnesses on you that I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am Yahweh who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Then they came to Elim, where there were 12 springs of water and 70 date palms, and they camped there by the waters."
Exodus,16,1,"The entire Israelite community departed from Elim and came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,The entire Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
Exodus,16,3,"The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger!”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow My instructions."
Exodus,16,5,"On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days.”"
Exodus,16,6,So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt;
Exodus,16,7,in the morning you will see the LORD’s glory because He has heard your complaints about Him. For who are we that you complain about us?”
Exodus,16,8,"Moses continued, “The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening and more than enough bread in the morning, for He has heard the complaints that you are raising against Him. Who are we? Your complaints are not against us but against the LORD.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the LORD, for He has heard your complaints.’”"
Exodus,16,10,"As Aaron was speaking to the entire Israelite community, they turned toward the wilderness, and there in a cloud the LORD’s glory appeared."
Exodus,16,11,"The LORD spoke to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them: At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will eat bread until you are full. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.”"
Exodus,16,13,So at evening quail came and covered the camp. In the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp.
Exodus,16,14,"When the layer of dew evaporated, there were fine flakes on the desert surface, as fine as frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” because they didn’t know what it was. Moses told them, “It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather as much of it as each person needs to eat. You may take two quarts per individual, according to the number of people each of you has in his tent.’”"
Exodus,16,17,"So the Israelites did this. Some gathered a lot, some a little."
Exodus,16,18,"When they measured it by quarts, the person who gathered a lot had no surplus, and the person who gathered a little had no shortage. Each gathered as much as he needed to eat."
Exodus,16,19,"Moses said to them, “No one is to let any of it remain until morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"But they didn’t listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and smelled. Therefore Moses was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"They gathered it every morning. Each gathered as much as he needed to eat, but when the sun grew hot, it melted."
Exodus,16,22,"On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts apiece, and all the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"He told them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is a day of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil, and set aside everything left over to be kept until morning.’”"
Exodus,16,24,"So they set it aside until morning as Moses commanded, and it didn’t smell or have any maggots in it."
Exodus,16,25,"“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you won’t find any in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"For six days you may gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”"
Exodus,16,27,"Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find any."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commands and instructions?"
Exodus,16,29,Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day He will give you two days’ worth of bread. Each of you stay where you are; no one is to leave his place on the seventh day.”
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"The house of Israel named the substance manna. It resembled coriander seed, was white, and tasted like wafers made with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Two quarts of it are to be preserved throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,16,33,"Moses told Aaron, “Take a container and put two quarts of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be preserved throughout your generations.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the testimony to be preserved."
Exodus,16,35,"The Israelites ate manna for 40 years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate manna until they reached the border of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,(Two quarts are a tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus,17,1,"The entire Israelite community left the Wilderness of Sin, moving from one place to the next according to the LORD’s command. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"So the people complained to Moses, “Give us water to drink.” “Why are you complaining to me?” Moses replied to them. “Why are you testing the LORD?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people thirsted there for water, and grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you ever bring us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What should I do with these people? In a little while they will stone me!”"
Exodus,17,5,"The LORD answered Moses, “Go on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take the staff you struck the Nile with in your hand and go."
Exodus,17,6,"I am going to stand there in front of you on the rock at Horeb; when you hit the rock, water will come out of it and the people will drink.” Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites complained, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,"At Rephidim, Amalek came and fought against Israel."
Exodus,17,9,"Moses said to Joshua, “Select some men for us and go fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop with God’s staff in my hand.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought against Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"While Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, but whenever he put his hand down, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"When Moses’ hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat down on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua defeated Amalek and his army with the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"The LORD then said to Moses, “Write this down on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua: I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek under heaven.”"
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses built an altar and named it, “The LORD Is My Banner.”"
Exodus,17,16,"He said, “Indeed, my hand is lifted up toward the LORD’s throne. The LORD will be at war with Amalek from generation to generation.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything that God had done for Moses and His people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"Now Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken in Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,"
Exodus,18,3,"along with her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom (because Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land”)"
Exodus,18,4,"and the other Eliezer (because he had said, “The God of my father was my helper and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword”)."
Exodus,18,5,"Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses’ wife and sons, came to him in the wilderness where he was camped at the mountain of God."
Exodus,18,6,"He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”"
Exodus,18,7,"So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and then kissed him. They asked each other how they had been and went into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that confronted them on the way, and how the LORD delivered them."
Exodus,18,9,Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the LORD had done for Israel when He rescued them from the power of the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,"“Praise the LORD,” Jethro exclaimed, “who rescued you from Pharaoh and the power of the Egyptians and snatched the people from the power of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods, because He did wonders when the Egyptians acted arrogantly against Israel.”"
Exodus,18,12,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in God’s presence."
Exodus,18,13,"The next day Moses sat down to judge the people, and they stood around Moses from morning until evening."
Exodus,18,14,"When Moses’ father-in-law saw everything he was doing for them he asked, “What is this thing you’re doing for the people? Why are you alone sitting as judge, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"Moses replied to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God."
Exodus,18,16,"Whenever they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I make a decision between one man and another. I teach them God’s statutes and laws.”"
Exodus,18,17,"“What you’re doing is not good,” Moses’ father-in-law said to him."
Exodus,18,18,"“You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You can’t do it alone."
Exodus,18,19,"Now listen to me; I will give you some advice, and God be with you. You be the one to represent the people before God and bring their cases to Him."
Exodus,18,20,"Instruct them about the statutes and laws, and teach them the way to live and what they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"But you should select from all the people able men, God-fearing, trustworthy, and hating bribes. Place them over the people as commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens."
Exodus,18,22,"They should judge the people at all times. Then they can bring you every important case but judge every minor case themselves. In this way you will lighten your load, and they will bear it with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this, and God so directs you, you will be able to endure, and also all these people will be able to go home satisfied.”"
Exodus,18,24,Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
Exodus,18,25,"So Moses chose able men from all Israel and made them leaders over the people as commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens."
Exodus,18,26,"They judged the people at all times; they would bring the hard cases to Moses, but they would judge every minor case themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"Then Moses said good-bye to his father-in-law, and he journeyed to his own land."
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month, on the same day of the month that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"After they departed from Rephidim, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"Moses went up the mountain to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain: “This is what you must say to the house of Jacob, and explain to the Israelites:"
Exodus,19,4,‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Me.
Exodus,19,5,"Now if you will listen to Me and carefully keep My covenant, you will be My own possession out of all the peoples, although all the earth is Mine,"
Exodus,19,6,and you will be My kingdom of priests and My holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.”
Exodus,19,7,"After Moses came back, he summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,19,8,"Then all the people responded together, “We will do all that the LORD has spoken.” So Moses brought the people’s words back to the LORD."
Exodus,19,9,"The LORD said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you and will always believe you.” Then Moses reported the people’s words to the LORD."
Exodus,19,10,"And the LORD told Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes"
Exodus,19,11,"and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."
Exodus,19,12,Put boundaries for the people all around the mountain and say: Be careful that you don’t go up on the mountain or touch its base. Anyone who touches the mountain will be put to death.
Exodus,19,13,"No hand may touch him; instead he will be stoned or shot with arrows. No animal or man will live. When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, they may go up the mountain.”"
Exodus,19,14,"Then Moses came down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"He said to the people, “Be prepared by the third day. Do not have sexual relations with women.”"
Exodus,19,16,"On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered."
Exodus,19,17,"Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the LORD came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently."
Exodus,19,19,"As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder."
Exodus,19,20,"The LORD came down on Mount Sinai at the top of the mountain. Then the LORD summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and he went up."
Exodus,19,21,"The LORD directed Moses, “Go down and warn the people not to break through to see the LORD; otherwise many of them will die."
Exodus,19,22,Even the priests who come near the LORD must purify themselves or the LORD will break out in anger against them.”
Exodus,19,23,"But Moses responded to the LORD, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, since You warned us: Put a boundary around the mountain and consider it holy.”"
Exodus,19,24,"And the LORD replied to him, “Go down and come back with Aaron. But the priests and the people must not break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break out in anger against them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus,20,1,Then God spoke all these words:
Exodus,20,2,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Exodus,20,3,Do not have other gods besides Me.
Exodus,20,4,"Do not make an idol for yourself, whether in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth."
Exodus,20,5,"You must not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the fathers’ sin, to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Exodus,20,6,but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commands.
Exodus,20,7,"Do not misuse the name of the LORD your God, because the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses His name."
Exodus,20,8,"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy:"
Exodus,20,9,"You are to labor six days and do all your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. You must not do any work—you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the foreigner who is within your gates."
Exodus,20,11,"For the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything in them in six days; then He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and declared it holy."
Exodus,20,12,Honor your father and your mother so that you may have a long life in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
Exodus,20,13,Do not murder.
Exodus,20,14,Do not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,Do not steal.
Exodus,20,16,Do not give false testimony against your neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,"Do not covet your neighbor’s house. Do not covet your neighbor’s wife, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
Exodus,20,18,"All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain surrounded by smoke. When the people saw it they trembled and stood at a distance."
Exodus,20,19,"“You speak to us, and we will listen,” they said to Moses, “but don’t let God speak to us, or we will die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"Moses responded to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that you will fear Him and will not sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,And the people remained standing at a distance as Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
Exodus,20,22,"Then the LORD told Moses, “This is what you are to say to the Israelites: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,You must not make gods of silver to rival Me; you must not make gods of gold for yourselves.
Exodus,20,24,"“You must make an earthen altar for Me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats, as well as your cattle. I will come to you and bless you in every place where I cause My name to be remembered."
Exodus,20,25,"If you make a stone altar for Me, you must not build it out of cut stones. If you use your chisel on it, you will defile it."
Exodus,20,26,"You must not go up to My altar on steps, so that your nakedness is not exposed on it."
Exodus,21,1,“These are the ordinances that you must set before them:
Exodus,21,2,"“When you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for six years; then in the seventh he is to leave as a free man without paying anything."
Exodus,21,3,"If he arrives alone, he is to leave alone; if he arrives with a wife, his wife is to leave with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children belong to her master, and the man must leave alone."
Exodus,21,5,"“But if the slave declares: ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I do not want to leave as a free man,’"
Exodus,21,6,"his master is to bring him to the judges and then bring him to the door or doorpost. His master must pierce his ear with an awl, and he will serve his master for life."
Exodus,21,7,"“When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she is not to leave as the male slaves do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she is displeasing to her master, who chose her for himself, then he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners because he has acted treacherously toward her."
Exodus,21,9,"Or if he chooses her for his son, he must deal with her according to the customary treatment of daughters."
Exodus,21,10,"If he takes an additional wife, he must not reduce the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife."
Exodus,21,11,"And if he does not do these three things for her, she may leave free of charge, without any exchange of money."
Exodus,21,12,“Whoever strikes a person so that he dies must be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,"But if he didn’t intend any harm, and yet God caused it to happen by his hand, I will appoint a place for you where he may flee."
Exodus,21,14,"If a person schemes and willfully acts against his neighbor to murder him, you must take him from My altar to be put to death."
Exodus,21,15,“Whoever strikes his father or his mother must be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"“Whoever kidnaps a person must be put to death, whether he sells him or the person is found in his possession."
Exodus,21,17,“Whoever curses his father or his mother must be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,"“When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or his fist, and the injured man does not die but is confined to bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"if he can later get up and walk around outside leaning on his staff, then the one who struck him will be exempt from punishment. Nevertheless, he must pay for his lost work time and provide for his complete recovery."
Exodus,21,20,"“When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod, and the slave dies under his abuse, the owner must be punished."
Exodus,21,21,"However, if the slave can stand up after a day or two, the owner should not be punished because he is his owner’s property."
Exodus,21,22,"“When men get in a fight and hit a pregnant woman so that her children are born prematurely but there is no injury, the one who hit her must be fined as the woman’s husband demands from him, and he must pay according to judicial assessment."
Exodus,21,23,"If there is an injury, then you must give life for life,"
Exodus,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
Exodus,21,25,"burn for burn, bruise for bruise, wound for wound."
Exodus,21,26,"“When a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave and destroys it, he must let the slave go free in compensation for his eye."
Exodus,21,27,"If he knocks out the tooth of his male or female slave, he must let the slave go free in compensation for his tooth."
Exodus,21,28,"“When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned, and its meat may not be eaten, but the ox’s owner is innocent."
Exodus,21,29,"However, if the ox was in the habit of goring, and its owner has been warned yet does not restrain it, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox must be stoned, and its owner must also be put to death."
Exodus,21,30,"If instead a ransom is demanded of him, he can pay a redemption price for his life in the full amount demanded from him."
Exodus,21,31,"If it gores a son or a daughter, he is to be dealt with according to this same law."
Exodus,21,32,"If the ox gores a male or female slave, he must give 30 shekels of silver to the slave’s master, and the ox must be stoned."
Exodus,21,33,"“When a man uncovers a pit or digs a pit, and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,"
Exodus,21,34,"the owner of the pit must give compensation; he must pay money to its owner, but the dead animal will become his."
Exodus,21,35,"“When a man’s ox injures his neighbor’s ox and it dies, they must sell the live ox and divide its proceeds; they must also divide the dead animal."
Exodus,21,36,"If, however, it is known that the ox was in the habit of goring, yet its owner has not restrained it, he must compensate fully, ox for ox; the dead animal will become his."
Exodus,22,1,"“When a man steals an ox or a sheep and butchers it or sells it, he must repay five cattle for the ox or four sheep for the sheep."
Exodus,22,2,"If a thief is caught in the act of breaking in, and he is beaten to death, no one is guilty of bloodshed."
Exodus,22,3,"But if this happens after sunrise, there is guilt of bloodshed. A thief must make full restitution. If he is unable, he is to be sold because of his theft."

Exodus,28,43,"These must be worn by Aaron and his sons whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar to minister in the sanctuary area, so that they do not incur guilt and die. This is to be a permanent statute for Aaron and for his future descendants."
Exodus,29,1,"“This is what you are to do for them to consecrate them to serve Me as priests. Take a young bull and two unblemished rams,"
Exodus,29,2,"with unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers coated with oil. Make them out of fine wheat flour,"
Exodus,29,3,"put them in a basket, and bring them in the basket, along with the bull and two rams."
Exodus,29,4,Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
Exodus,29,5,"Then take the garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe for the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastpiece; fasten the ephod on him with its woven waistband."
Exodus,29,6,Put the turban on his head and place the holy diadem on the turban.
Exodus,29,7,"Take the anointing oil, pour it on his head, and anoint him."
Exodus,29,8,You must also bring his sons and clothe them with tunics.
Exodus,29,9,Tie the sashes on Aaron and his sons and fasten headbands on them. The priesthood is to be theirs by a permanent statute. This is the way you will ordain Aaron and his sons.
Exodus,29,10,"“You are to bring the bull to the front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons must lay their hands on the bull’s head."
Exodus,29,11,Slaughter the bull before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Exodus,29,12,Take some of the bull’s blood and apply it to the horns of the altar with your finger; then pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
Exodus,29,13,"Take all the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar."
Exodus,29,14,"But burn up the bull’s flesh, its hide, and its dung outside the camp; it is a sin offering."
Exodus,29,15,"“Take one ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the ram’s head."
Exodus,29,16,"You are to slaughter the ram, take its blood, and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar."
Exodus,29,17,"Cut the ram into pieces. Wash its entrails and shanks, and place them with its head and its pieces on the altar."
Exodus,29,18,"Then burn the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to the LORD. It is a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD."
Exodus,29,19,"“You are to take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons must lay their hands on the ram’s head."
Exodus,29,20,"Slaughter the ram, take some of its blood, and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on his sons’ right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Sprinkle the remaining blood on all sides of the altar."
Exodus,29,21,"Take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle them on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. In this way, he and his garments will become holy, as well as his sons and their garments."
Exodus,29,22,"“Take the fat from the ram, the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh (since this is a ram for ordination);"
Exodus,29,23,"take one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD;"
Exodus,29,24,and put all of them in the hands of Aaron and his sons and wave them as a presentation offering before the LORD.
Exodus,29,25,"Take them from their hands and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before the LORD; it is a fire offering to the LORD."
Exodus,29,26,“Take the breast from the ram of Aaron’s ordination and wave it as a presentation offering before the LORD; it is to be your portion.
Exodus,29,27,Consecrate for Aaron and his sons the breast of the presentation offering that is waved and the thigh of the contribution that is lifted up from the ram of ordination.
Exodus,29,28,"This will belong to Aaron and his sons as a regular portion from the Israelites, for it is a contribution. It will be the Israelites’ contribution from their fellowship sacrifices, their contribution to the LORD."
Exodus,29,29,"“The holy garments that belong to Aaron are to belong to his sons after him, so that they can be anointed and ordained in them."
Exodus,29,30,Any priest who is one of his sons and who succeeds him and enters the tent of meeting to minister in the sanctuary must wear them for seven days.
Exodus,29,31,“You are to take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.
Exodus,29,32,Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Exodus,29,33,"They must eat those things by which atonement was made at the time of their ordination and consecration. An unauthorized person must not eat them, for these things are holy."
Exodus,29,34,"If any of the meat of ordination or any of the bread is left until morning, burn up what is left over. It must not be eaten because it is holy."
Exodus,29,35,“This is what you are to do for Aaron and his sons based on all I have commanded you. Take seven days to ordain them.
Exodus,29,36,"Sacrifice a bull as a sin offering each day for atonement. Purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and anoint it in order to consecrate it."
Exodus,29,37,For seven days you must make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. The altar will become especially holy; whatever touches the altar will become holy.
Exodus,29,38,“This is what you are to offer regularly on the altar every day: two year-old lambs.
Exodus,29,39,"In the morning offer one lamb, and at twilight offer the other lamb."
Exodus,29,40,"With the first lamb offer two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of oil from crushed olives, and a drink offering of one quart of wine."
Exodus,29,41,"You are to offer the second lamb at twilight. Offer a grain offering and a drink offering with it, like the one in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD."
Exodus,29,42,"This will be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet you to speak with you."
Exodus,29,43,"I will also meet with the Israelites there, and that place will be consecrated by My glory."
Exodus,29,44,I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests.
Exodus,29,45,I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
Exodus,29,46,"And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, so that I might dwell among them. I am Yahweh their God."
Exodus,30,1,“You are to make an altar for the burning of incense; make it of acacia wood.
Exodus,30,2,"It must be square, 18 inches long and 18 inches wide; it must be 36 inches high. Its horns must be of one piece."
Exodus,30,3,"Overlay its top, all around its sides, and its horns with pure gold; make a gold molding all around it."
Exodus,30,4,Make two gold rings for it under the molding on two of its sides; put these on opposite sides of it to be holders for the poles to carry it with.
Exodus,30,5,Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
Exodus,30,6,“You are to place the altar in front of the veil by the ark of the testimony—in front of the mercy seat that is over the testimony—where I will meet with you.
Exodus,30,7,Aaron must burn fragrant incense on it; he must burn it every morning when he tends the lamps.
Exodus,30,8,"When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he must burn incense. There is to be an incense offering before the LORD throughout your generations."
Exodus,30,9,"You must not offer unauthorized incense on it, or a burnt or grain offering; you are not to pour a drink offering on it."
Exodus,30,10,"“Once a year Aaron is to perform the purification rite on the horns of the altar. Throughout your generations he is to perform the purification rite for it once a year, with the blood of the sin offering for atonement. The altar is especially holy to the LORD.”"
Exodus,30,11,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Exodus,30,12,"“When you take a census of the Israelites to register them, each of the men must pay a ransom for himself to the LORD as they are registered. Then no plague will come on them as they are registered."
Exodus,30,13,Everyone who is registered must pay half a shekel according to the sanctuary shekel (20 gerahs to the shekel). This half shekel is a contribution to the LORD.
Exodus,30,14,"Each man who is registered, 20 years old or more, must give this contribution to the LORD."
Exodus,30,15,The wealthy may not give more and the poor may not give less than half a shekel when giving the contribution to the LORD to atone for your lives.
Exodus,30,16,Take the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will serve as a reminder for the Israelites before the LORD to atone for your lives.”
Exodus,30,17,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Exodus,30,18,"“Make a bronze basin for washing and a bronze stand for it. Set it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it."
Exodus,30,19,Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet from the basin.
Exodus,30,20,"Whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar to minister by burning up an offering to the LORD, they must wash with water so that they will not die."
Exodus,30,21,"They must wash their hands and feet so that they will not die; this is to be a permanent statute for them, for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations.”"
Exodus,30,22,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Exodus,30,23,"“Take for yourself the finest spices: 12½ pounds of liquid myrrh, half as much (6¼ pounds) of fragrant cinnamon, 6¼ pounds of fragrant cane,"
Exodus,30,24,"12½ pounds of cassia (by the sanctuary shekel), and one gallon of olive oil."
Exodus,30,25,"Prepare from these a holy anointing oil, a scented blend, the work of a perfumer; it will be holy anointing oil."
Exodus,30,26,"“With it you are to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony,"
Exodus,30,27,"the table with all its utensils, the lampstand with its utensils, the altar of incense,"
Exodus,30,28,"the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand."
Exodus,30,29,Consecrate them and they will be especially holy. Whatever touches them will be consecrated.
Exodus,30,30,Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them to serve Me as priests.
Exodus,30,31,“Tell the Israelites: This will be My holy anointing oil throughout your generations.
Exodus,30,32,"It must not be used for ordinary anointing on a person’s body, and you must not make anything like it using its formula. It is holy, and it must be holy to you."
Exodus,30,33,Anyone who blends something like it or puts some of it on an unauthorized person must be cut off from his people.”
Exodus,30,34,"The LORD said to Moses: “Take fragrant spices: stacte, onycha, and galbanum; the spices and pure frankincense are to be in equal measures."
Exodus,30,35,"Prepare expertly blended incense from these; it is to be seasoned with salt, pure and holy."
Exodus,30,36,"Grind some of it into a fine powder and put some in front of the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It must be especially holy to you."
Exodus,30,37,"As for the incense you are making, you must not make any for yourselves using its formula. It is to be regarded by you as sacred to the LORD."
Exodus,30,38,Anyone who makes something like it to smell its fragrance must be cut off from his people.”
Exodus,31,1,The LORD also spoke to Moses:
Exodus,31,2,"“Look, I have appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,31,3,"I have filled him with God’s Spirit, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every craft"
Exodus,31,4,"to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,"
Exodus,31,5,"to cut gemstones for mounting, and to carve wood for work in every craft."
Exodus,31,6,"I have also selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to be with him. I have placed wisdom within every skilled craftsman in order to make all that I have commanded you:"
Exodus,31,7,"the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on top of it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—"
Exodus,31,8,"the table with its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,"
Exodus,31,9,"the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the basin with its stand—"
Exodus,31,10,"the specially woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests,"
Exodus,31,11,"the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. They must make them according to all that I have commanded you.”"
Exodus,31,12,The LORD said to Moses:
Exodus,31,13,"“Tell the Israelites: You must observe My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you will know that I am Yahweh who sets you apart."
Exodus,31,14,"Observe the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Whoever profanes it must be put to death. If anyone does work on it, that person must be cut off from his people."
Exodus,31,15,"Work may be done for six days, but on the seventh day there must be a Sabbath of complete rest, dedicated to the LORD. Anyone who does work on the Sabbath day must be put to death."
Exodus,31,16,"The Israelites must observe the Sabbath, celebrating it throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant."
Exodus,31,17,"It is a sign forever between Me and the Israelites, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.”"
Exodus,31,18,"When He finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God."
Exodus,32,1,"When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Come, make us a god who will go before us because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt—we don’t know what has happened to him!”"
Exodus,32,2,"Then Aaron replied to them, “Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring them to me.”"
Exodus,32,3,So all the people took off the gold rings that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took the gold from their hands, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it into an image of a calf. Then they said, “Israel, this is your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!”"
Exodus,32,5,"When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; then he made an announcement: “There will be a festival to the LORD tomorrow.”"
Exodus,32,6,"Early the next morning they arose, offered burnt offerings, and presented fellowship offerings. The people sat down to eat and drink, then got up to play."
Exodus,32,7,The LORD spoke to Moses: “Go down at once! For your people you brought up from the land of Egypt have acted corruptly.
Exodus,32,8,"They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them; they have made for themselves an image of a calf. They have bowed down to it, sacrificed to it, and said, ‘Israel, this is your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,32,9,"The LORD also said to Moses: “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people."
Exodus,32,10,"Now leave Me alone, so that My anger can burn against them and I can destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”"
Exodus,32,11,"But Moses interceded with the LORD his God: “LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out with an evil intent to kill them in the mountains and wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from Your great anger and relent concerning this disaster planned for Your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel—You swore to them by Your very self and declared, ‘I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky and will give your offspring all this land that I have promised, and they will inherit it forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,So the LORD relented concerning the disaster He said He would bring on His people.
Exodus,32,15,Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides—inscribed front and back.
Exodus,32,16,"The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was God’s writing, engraved on the tablets."
Exodus,32,17,"When Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of war in the camp.”"
Exodus,32,18,But Moses replied: It’s not the sound of a victory cry and not the sound of a cry of defeat; I hear the sound of singing!
Exodus,32,19,"As he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses became enraged and threw the tablets out of his hands, smashing them at the base of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,"Then he took the calf they had made, burned it up, and ground it to powder. He scattered the powder over the surface of the water and forced the Israelites to drink the water."
Exodus,32,21,"Then Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to you that you have led them into such a grave sin?”"
Exodus,32,22,"“Don’t be enraged, my lord,” Aaron replied. “You yourself know that the people are intent on evil."
Exodus,32,23,"They said to me, ‘Make us a god who will go before us because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt—we don’t know what has happened to him!’"
Exodus,32,24,"So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off,’ and they gave it to me. When I threw it into the fire, out came this calf!”"
Exodus,32,25,"Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them get out of control, resulting in weakness before their enemies."
Exodus,32,26,"And Moses stood at the camp’s entrance and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.” And all the Levites gathered around him."
Exodus,32,27,"He told them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘Every man fasten his sword to his side; go back and forth through the camp from entrance to entrance, and each of you kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’”"
Exodus,32,28,"The Levites did as Moses commanded, and about 3,000 men fell dead that day among the people."
Exodus,32,29,"Afterward Moses said, “Today you have been dedicated to the LORD, since each man went against his son and his brother. Therefore you have brought a blessing on yourselves today.”"
Exodus,32,30,"The following day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a grave sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I will be able to atone for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Oh, these people have committed a grave sin; they have made a god of gold for themselves."
Exodus,32,32,"Now if You would only forgive their sin. But if not, please erase me from the book You have written.”"
Exodus,32,33,The LORD replied to Moses: “I will erase whoever has sinned against Me from My book.
Exodus,32,34,"Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about; see, My angel will go before you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will hold them accountable for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,And the LORD inflicted a plague on the people for what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
Exodus,33,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses: “Go, leave here, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: I will give it to your offspring."
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel ahead of you and will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Exodus,33,3,"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard this bad news, they mourned and didn’t put on their jewelry."
Exodus,33,5,"For the LORD said to Moses: “Tell the Israelites: You are a stiff-necked people. If I went with you for a single moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you.”"
Exodus,33,6,So the Israelites remained stripped of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
Exodus,33,7,"Now Moses took a tent and set it up outside the camp, far away from the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. Anyone who wanted to consult the LORD would go to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand up, each one at the door of his tent, and they would watch Moses until he entered the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance to the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"As all the people saw the pillar of cloud remaining at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up, then bow in worship, each one at the door of his tent."
Exodus,33,11,"The LORD spoke with Moses face to face, just as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his assistant, the young man Joshua son of Nun, would not leave the inside of the tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the LORD, “Look, You have told me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. You said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.’"
Exodus,33,13,"Now if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, please teach me Your ways, and I will know You and find favor in Your sight. Now consider that this nation is Your people.”"
Exodus,33,14,"Then He replied, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”"
Exodus,33,15,"“If Your presence does not go,” Moses responded to Him, “don’t make us go up from here."
Exodus,33,16,How will it be known that I and Your people have found favor in Your sight unless You go with us? I and Your people will be distinguished by this from all the other people on the face of the earth.”
Exodus,33,17,"The LORD answered Moses, “I will do this very thing you have asked, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.”"
Exodus,33,18,"Then Moses said, “Please, let me see Your glory.”"
Exodus,33,19,"He said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim the name Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.”"
Exodus,33,20,"But He answered, “You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.”"
Exodus,33,21,"The LORD said, “Here is a place near Me. You are to stand on the rock,"
Exodus,33,22,"and when My glory passes by, I will put you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,"Then I will take My hand away, and you will see My back, but My face will not be seen.”"
Exodus,34,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke."
Exodus,34,2,Be prepared by morning. Come up Mount Sinai in the morning and stand before Me on the mountaintop.
Exodus,34,3,"No one may go up with you; in fact, no one must be seen anywhere on the mountain. Even the flocks and herds are not to graze in front of that mountain.”"
Exodus,34,4,"Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones. He got up early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hand, he climbed Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,34,5,"The LORD came down in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed His name Yahweh."
Exodus,34,6,"Then the LORD passed in front of him and proclaimed: Yahweh—Yahweh is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in faithful love and truth,"
Exodus,34,7,"maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving wrongdoing, rebellion, and sin. But He will not leave the guilty unpunished, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ wrongdoing on the children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation."
Exodus,34,8,Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped.
Exodus,34,9,"Then he said, “My Lord, if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Even though this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wrongdoing and sin, and accept us as Your own possession.”"
Exodus,34,10,"And the LORD responded: “Look, I am making a covenant. I will perform wonders in the presence of all your people that have never been done in all the earth or in any nation. All the people you live among will see the LORD’s work, for what I am doing with you is awe-inspiring."
Exodus,34,11,"Observe what I command you today. I am going to drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Exodus,34,12,"Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land that you are going to enter; otherwise, they will become a snare among you."
Exodus,34,13,"Instead, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, and chop down their Asherah poles."
Exodus,34,14,"You are never to bow down to another god because Yahweh, being jealous by nature, is a jealous God."
Exodus,34,15,"“Do not make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land, or else when they prostitute themselves with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices."
Exodus,34,16,Then you will take some of their daughters as brides for your sons. Their daughters will prostitute themselves with their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods.
Exodus,34,17,“Do not make cast images of gods for yourselves.
Exodus,34,18,“Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You are to eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib as I commanded you. For you came out of Egypt in the month of Abib.
Exodus,34,19,"“The firstborn male from every womb belongs to Me, including all your male livestock, the firstborn of cattle or sheep."
Exodus,34,20,"You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a sheep, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed."
Exodus,34,21,“You are to labor six days but you must rest on the seventh day; you must even rest during plowing and harvesting times.
Exodus,34,22,"“Observe the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the agricultural year."
Exodus,34,23,"Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory. No one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.
Exodus,34,25,“Do not present the blood for My sacrifice with anything leavened. The sacrifice of the Passover Festival must not remain until morning.
Exodus,34,26,“Bring the best firstfruits of your land to the house of the LORD your God. “You must not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
Exodus,34,27,"The LORD also said to Moses, “Write down these words, for I have made a covenant with you and with Israel based on these words.”"
Exodus,34,28,"Moses was there with the LORD 40 days and 40 nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. He wrote the Ten Commandments, the words of the covenant, on the tablets."
Exodus,34,29,As Moses descended from Mount Sinai—with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands as he descended the mountain—he did not realize that the skin of his face shone as a result of his speaking with the LORD.
Exodus,34,30,"When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face shone! They were afraid to come near him."
Exodus,34,31,"But Moses called out to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and Moses spoke to them."
Exodus,34,32,"Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he commanded them to do everything the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face."
Exodus,34,34,"But whenever Moses went before the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. After he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded,"
Exodus,34,35,and the Israelites would see that Moses’ face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil over his face again until he went to speak with the LORD.
Exodus,35,1,"Moses assembled the entire Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:"
Exodus,35,2,"For six days work is to be done, but on the seventh day you are to have a holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest to the LORD. Anyone who does work on it must be executed."
Exodus,35,3,Do not light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day.”
Exodus,35,4,"Then Moses said to the entire Israelite community, “This is what the LORD has commanded:"
Exodus,35,5,"Take up an offering among you for the LORD. Let everyone whose heart is willing bring this as the LORD’s offering: gold, silver, and bronze;"
Exodus,35,6,"blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;"
Exodus,35,7,ram skins dyed red and manatee skins; acacia wood;
Exodus,35,8,oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
Exodus,35,9,and onyx with gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,“Let all the skilled craftsmen among you come and make everything that the LORD has commanded:
Exodus,35,11,"the tabernacle—its tent and covering, its clasps and planks, its crossbars, its posts and bases;"
Exodus,35,12,"the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the veil for the screen;"
Exodus,35,13,"the table with its poles, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;"
Exodus,35,14,the lampstand for light with its utensils and lamps as well as the oil for the light;
Exodus,35,15,the altar of incense with its poles; the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the entryway screen for the entrance to the tabernacle;
Exodus,35,16,"the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grate, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;"
Exodus,35,17,"the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and bases, and the screen for the gate of the courtyard;"
Exodus,35,18,"the tent pegs for the tabernacle and the tent pegs for the courtyard, along with their ropes;"
Exodus,35,19,and the specially woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary—the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests.”
Exodus,35,20,Then the entire Israelite community left Moses’ presence.
Exodus,35,21,"Everyone whose heart was moved and whose spirit prompted him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its services, and for the holy garments."
Exodus,35,22,"Both men and women came; all who had willing hearts brought brooches, earrings, rings, necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry—everyone who waved a presentation offering of gold to the LORD."
Exodus,35,23,"Everyone who had in his possession blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, fine linen or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or manatee skins, brought them."
Exodus,35,24,Everyone making an offering of silver or bronze brought it as a contribution to the LORD. Everyone who possessed acacia wood useful for any task in the work brought it.
Exodus,35,25,"Every skilled woman spun yarn with her hands and brought it: blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen."
Exodus,35,26,And all the women whose hearts were moved spun the goat hair by virtue of their skill.
Exodus,35,27,"The leaders brought onyx and gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece,"
Exodus,35,28,"as well as the spice and oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense."
Exodus,35,29,"So the Israelites brought a freewill offering to the LORD, all the men and women whose hearts prompted them to bring something for all the work that the LORD, through Moses, had commanded to be done."
Exodus,35,30,"Moses then said to the Israelites: “Look, the LORD has appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,35,31,"He has filled him with God’s Spirit, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every kind of craft"
Exodus,35,32,"to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,"
Exodus,35,33,"to cut gemstones for mounting, and to carve wood for work in every kind of artistic craft."
Exodus,35,34,"He has also given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others."
Exodus,35,35,"He has filled them with skill to do all the work of a gem cutter; a designer; an embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen; and a weaver. They can do every kind of craft and design artistic designs."
Exodus,36,1,"Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the skilled people are to work based on everything the LORD has commanded. The LORD has given them wisdom and understanding to know how to do all the work of constructing the sanctuary.”"
Exodus,36,2,"So Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person in whose heart the LORD had placed wisdom, everyone whose heart moved him, to come to the work and do it."
Exodus,36,3,"They took from Moses’ presence all the contributions that the Israelites had brought for the task of making the sanctuary. Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning."
Exodus,36,4,Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work for the sanctuary came one by one from the work they were doing
Exodus,36,5,"and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than is needed for the construction of the work the LORD commanded to be done.”"
Exodus,36,6,"After Moses gave an order, they sent a proclamation throughout the camp: “Let no man or woman make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people stopped."
Exodus,36,7,The materials were sufficient for them to do all the work. There was more than enough.
Exodus,36,8,"All the skilled craftsmen among those doing the work made the tabernacle with 10 curtains. Bezalel made them of finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with a design of cherubim worked into them."
Exodus,36,9,"The length of each curtain was 42 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet; all the curtains had the same measurements."
Exodus,36,10,"He joined five of the curtains to each other, and the other five curtains he joined to each other."
Exodus,36,11,He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the last curtain in the first set and did the same on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.
Exodus,36,12,"He made 50 loops on the one curtain and 50 loops on the edge of the curtain in the second set, so that the loops lined up with each other."
Exodus,36,13,"He also made 50 gold clasps and joined the curtains to each other, so that the tabernacle became a single unit."
Exodus,36,14,He made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made 11 of them.
Exodus,36,15,"The length of each curtain was 45 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet. All 11 curtains had the same measurements."
Exodus,36,16,"He joined five of the curtains together, and the other six together."
Exodus,36,17,He made 50 loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set and 50 loops on the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.
Exodus,36,18,He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together as a single unit.
Exodus,36,19,He also made a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red and a covering of manatee skins on top of it.
Exodus,36,20,He made upright planks of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,21,"The length of each plank was 15 feet, and the width of each was 27 inches."
Exodus,36,22,There were two tenons connected to each other for each plank. He did the same for all the planks of the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,23,"He made planks for the tabernacle as follows: 20 for the south side,"
Exodus,36,24,"and he made 40 silver bases to put under the 20 planks, two bases under the first plank for its two tenons, and two bases under each of the following planks for their two tenons;"
Exodus,36,25,"for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made 20 planks,"
Exodus,36,26,"with their 40 silver bases, two bases under the first plank and two bases under each of the following ones;"
Exodus,36,27,and for the west side of the tabernacle he made six planks.
Exodus,36,28,He also made two additional planks for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,29,They were paired at the bottom and joined together at the top in a single ring. This is what he did with both of them for the two corners.
Exodus,36,30,"So there were eight planks with their 16 silver bases, two bases under each one."
Exodus,36,31,"He made five crossbars of acacia wood for the planks on one side of the tabernacle,"
Exodus,36,32,"five crossbars for the planks on the other side of the tabernacle, and five crossbars for those at the back of the tabernacle on the west."
Exodus,36,33,He made the central crossbar run through the middle of the planks from one end to the other.
Exodus,36,34,He overlaid them with gold and made their rings out of gold as holders for the crossbars. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
Exodus,36,35,"Then he made the veil with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. He made it with a design of cherubim worked into it."
Exodus,36,36,He made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold. And he cast four silver bases for the posts.
Exodus,36,37,"He made a screen embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen for the entrance to the tent,"
Exodus,36,38,"together with its five posts and their hooks. He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, but their five bases were bronze."
Exodus,37,1,"Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high."
Exodus,37,2,He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out and made a gold molding all around it.

Exodus,37,8,"one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. At each end, he made a cherub of one piece with the mercy seat."
Exodus,37,9,They had wings spread out. They faced each other and covered the mercy seat with their wings. The faces of the cherubim were looking toward the mercy seat.

Exodus,37,11,He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding all around it.
Exodus,37,12,He made a three-inch frame all around it and made a gold molding all around its frame.
Exodus,37,13,He cast four gold rings for it and attached the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
Exodus,37,14,The rings were next to the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table.
Exodus,37,15,He made the poles for carrying the table from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus,37,16,"He also made the utensils that would be on the table out of pure gold: its plates and cups, as well as its bowls and pitchers for pouring drink offerings."
Exodus,37,17,"Then he made the lampstand out of pure hammered gold. He made it all of one piece: its base and shaft, its ornamental cups, and its calyxes and petals."
Exodus,37,18,"Six branches extended from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from one side and three branches of the lampstand from the other side."
Exodus,37,19,"There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a calyx and petals, on the first branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a calyx and petals, on the next branch. It was this way for the six branches that extended from the lampstand."
Exodus,37,20,On the lampstand shaft there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms with its calyxes and petals.
Exodus,37,21,"For the six branches that extended from it, a calyx was under the first pair of branches from it, a calyx under the second pair of branches from it, and a calyx under the third pair of branches from it."
Exodus,37,22,Their calyxes and branches were of one piece. All of it was a single hammered piece of pure gold.
Exodus,37,23,"He also made its seven lamps, snuffers, and firepans of pure gold."
Exodus,37,24,He made it and all its utensils of 75 pounds of pure gold.

Exodus,37,26,"He overlaid it, its top, all around its sides, and its horns with pure gold. Then he made a gold molding all around it."
Exodus,37,27,He made two gold rings for it under the molding on two of its sides; he put these on opposite sides of it to be holders for the poles to carry it with.

Exodus,40,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Exodus,40,2,"“You are to set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month."
Exodus,40,3,Put the ark of the testimony there and screen off the ark with the veil.
Exodus,40,4,Then bring in the table and lay out its arrangement; also bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
Exodus,40,5,Place the gold altar for incense in front of the ark of the testimony. Put up the screen for the entrance to the tabernacle.
Exodus,40,6,"Position the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting."
Exodus,40,7,"Place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it."
Exodus,40,8,Assemble the surrounding courtyard and hang the screen for the gate of the courtyard.
Exodus,40,9,“Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it along with all its furnishings so that it will be holy.
Exodus,40,10,Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar so that it will be especially holy.
Exodus,40,11,Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate it.
Exodus,40,12,“Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
Exodus,40,13,"Clothe Aaron with the holy garments, anoint him, and consecrate him, so that he can serve Me as a priest."
Exodus,40,14,Have his sons come forward and clothe them in tunics.
Exodus,40,15,"Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may also serve Me as priests. Their anointing will serve to inaugurate a permanent priesthood for them throughout their generations.”"
Exodus,40,16,Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.
Exodus,40,17,"The tabernacle was set up in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month."
Exodus,40,18,"Moses set up the tabernacle: he laid its bases, positioned its planks, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts."
Exodus,40,19,"Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,20,"Moses took the testimony and placed it in the ark, and attached the poles to the ark. He set the mercy seat on top of the ark."
Exodus,40,21,"He brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,40,22,"Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil."
Exodus,40,23,"He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,40,24,He also put the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
Exodus,40,25,"and set up the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,40,26,"Moses also installed the gold altar in the tent of meeting, in front of the veil,"
Exodus,40,27,"and burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,40,28,He put up the screen at the entrance to the tabernacle.
Exodus,40,29,"Then he placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered the burnt offering and the grain offering on it, just as the LORD had commanded him."
Exodus,40,30,He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
Exodus,40,31,"Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet from it."
Exodus,40,32,"They washed whenever they came to the tent of meeting and approached the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Exodus,40,33,Next Moses set up the surrounding courtyard for the tabernacle and the altar and hung a screen for the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.
Exodus,40,34,"The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,35,"Moses was unable to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud rested on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
Exodus,40,36,The Israelites set out whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle throughout all the stages of their journey.
Exodus,40,37,"If the cloud was not taken up, they did not set out until the day it was taken up."
Exodus,40,38,"For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and there was a fire inside the cloud by night, visible to the entire house of Israel throughout all the stages of their journey."
Leviticus,1,1,Then the LORD summoned Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting:
Leviticus,1,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any of you brings an offering to the LORD from the livestock, you may bring your offering from the herd or the flock."
Leviticus,1,3,"“If his gift is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to bring an unblemished male. He must bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting so that he may be accepted by the LORD."
Leviticus,1,4,He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering so it can be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
Leviticus,1,5,He is to slaughter the bull before the LORD; Aaron’s sons the priests are to present the blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,1,6,Then he must skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
Leviticus,1,7,The sons of Aaron the priest will prepare a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
Leviticus,1,8,"Aaron’s sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, the head, and the suet on top of the burning wood on the altar."
Leviticus,1,9,"The offerer must wash its entrails and shanks with water. Then the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,10,"“But if his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from sheep or goats, he is to present an unblemished male."
Leviticus,1,11,He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD. Aaron’s sons the priests will sprinkle its blood against the altar on all sides.
Leviticus,1,12,"He will cut the animal into pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest will arrange them on top of the burning wood on the altar."
Leviticus,1,13,"But he is to wash the entrails and shanks with water. The priest will then present all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,1,14,"“If his gift to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, he is to present his offering from the turtledoves or young pigeons."
Leviticus,1,15,"Then the priest must bring it to the altar, and must twist off its head and burn it on the altar; its blood should be drained at the side of the altar."
Leviticus,1,16,"He will remove its digestive tract, cutting off the tail feathers, and throw it on the east side of the altar at the place for ashes."
Leviticus,1,17,"He will tear it open by its wings without dividing the bird. Then the priest is to burn it on the altar on top of the burning wood. It is a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,1,"“When anyone presents a grain offering as a gift to the LORD, his gift must consist of fine flour. He is to pour olive oil on it, put frankincense on it,"
Leviticus,2,2,"and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest will take a handful of fine flour and oil from it, along with all its frankincense, and will burn this memorial portion of it on the altar, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,3,But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons; it is the holiest part of the fire offerings to the LORD.
Leviticus,2,4,"“When you present a grain offering baked in an oven, it must be made of fine flour, either unleavened cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"If your gift is a grain offering prepared on a griddle, it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,2,6,Break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,7,"If your gift is a grain offering prepared in a pan, it must be made of fine flour with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"When you bring to the LORD the grain offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the priest, and he will take it to the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"The priest will remove the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,10,But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons; it is the holiest part of the fire offerings to the LORD.
Leviticus,2,11,"“No grain offering that you present to the LORD is to be made with yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey as a fire offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,2,12,"You may present them to the LORD as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma."
Leviticus,2,13,You are to season each of your grain offerings with salt; you must not omit from your grain offering the salt of the covenant with your God. You are to present salt with each of your offerings.
Leviticus,2,14,"“If you present a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you must present fresh heads of grain, crushed kernels, roasted on the fire, for your grain offering of firstfruits."
Leviticus,2,15,You are to put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,16,The priest will then burn some of its crushed kernels and oil with all its frankincense as a fire offering to the LORD.
Leviticus,3,1,"“If his offering is a fellowship sacrifice, and he is presenting an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he must present one without blemish before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,2,He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests will sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,3,"He will present part of the fellowship sacrifice as a fire offering to the LORD: the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,4,and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins; he will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys.
Leviticus,3,5,"Aaron’s sons will burn it on the altar along with the burnt offering that is on the burning wood, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,6,"“If his offering as a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD is from the flock, he must present a male or female without blemish."
Leviticus,3,7,"If he is presenting a lamb for his offering, he is to present it before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,8,"He must lay his hand on the head of his offering, then slaughter it before the tent of meeting. Aaron’s sons will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar."
Leviticus,3,9,"He will then present part of the fellowship sacrifice as a fire offering to the LORD consisting of its fat and the entire fat tail, which he is to remove close to the backbone. He will also remove the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,10,"the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins, and the fatty lobe of the liver above the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,11,"Then the priest will burn the food on the altar, as a fire offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,12,"“If his offering is a goat, he is to present it before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,13,He must lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the tent of meeting. Aaron’s sons will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
Leviticus,3,14,"He will present part of his offering as a fire offering to the LORD: the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,3,15,and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins; he will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys.
Leviticus,3,16,"Then the priest will burn the food on the altar, as a fire offering for a pleasing aroma. “All fat belongs to the LORD."
Leviticus,3,17,"This is a permanent statute throughout your generations, wherever you live: you must not eat any fat or any blood.”"
Leviticus,4,1,Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,4,2,“Tell the Israelites: When someone sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s commands and does anything prohibited by them—
Leviticus,4,3,"“If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he is to present to the LORD a young, unblemished bull as a sin offering for the sin he has committed."
Leviticus,4,4,"He must bring the bull to the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter it before the LORD."
Leviticus,4,5,The anointed priest must then take some of the bull’s blood and bring it into the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,6,The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus,4,7,The priest must apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. He must pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,8,"He is to remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering: the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat that is on the entrails,"
Leviticus,4,9,"and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins. He will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys,"
Leviticus,4,10,just as the fat is removed from the ox of the fellowship sacrifice. The priest is to burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,11,"But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and shanks, and its entrails and dung—"
Leviticus,4,12,"all the rest of the bull—he must bring to a ceremonially clean place outside the camp to the ash heap, and must burn it on a wood fire. It is to be burned at the ash heap."
Leviticus,4,13,"“Now if the whole community of Israel errs, and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, so that they violate any of the LORD’s commands and incur guilt by doing what is prohibited,"
Leviticus,4,14,"then the assembly must present a young bull as a sin offering. When the sin they have committed in regard to the command becomes known, they are to bring it before the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,4,15,The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the LORD and it is to be slaughtered before the LORD.
Leviticus,4,16,The anointed priest will bring some of the bull’s blood into the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,17,The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil.
Leviticus,4,18,He is to apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. He must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,19,He is to remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar.
Leviticus,4,20,"He is to offer this bull just as he did with the bull in the sin offering; he will offer it the same way. So the priest will make atonement on their behalf, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,21,Then he will bring the bull outside the camp and burn it just as he burned the first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly.
Leviticus,4,22,"“When a leader sins and unintentionally violates any of the commands of the LORD his God by doing what is prohibited, and incurs guilt,"
Leviticus,4,23,"or someone informs him about the sin he has committed, he is to bring an unblemished male goat as his offering."
Leviticus,4,24,He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering.
Leviticus,4,25,Then the priest must take some of the blood from the sin offering with his finger and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering. The rest of its blood he must pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,26,"He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the fellowship sacrifice. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for that person’s sin, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,27,"“Now if any of the common people sins unintentionally by violating one of the LORD’s commands, does what is prohibited, and incurs guilt,"
Leviticus,4,28,"or if someone informs him about the sin he has committed, then he is to bring an unblemished female goat as his offering for the sin that he has committed."
Leviticus,4,29,He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,30,Then the priest must take some of its blood with his finger and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He must pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,31,"He is to remove all its fat just as the fat is removed from the fellowship sacrifice. The priest is to burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,32,"“Or if the offering that he brings as a sin offering is a lamb, he is to bring an unblemished female."
Leviticus,4,33,He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
Leviticus,4,34,Then the priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He must pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,35,"He is to remove all its fat just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the fellowship sacrifice. The priest will burn it on the altar along with the fire offerings to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,1,"“When someone sins in any of these ways: If he has seen, heard, or known about something he has witnessed, and did not respond to a public call to testify, he is responsible for his sin."
Leviticus,5,2,"Or if someone touches anything unclean—a carcass of an unclean wild animal, or unclean livestock, or an unclean swarming creature—without being aware of it, he is unclean and guilty."
Leviticus,5,3,"Or if he touches human uncleanness—any uncleanness by which one can become defiled—without being aware of it, but later recognizes it, he is guilty."
Leviticus,5,4,"Or if someone swears rashly to do what is good or evil—concerning anything a person may speak rashly in an oath—without being aware of it, but later recognizes it, he incurs guilt in such an instance."
Leviticus,5,5,"If someone incurs guilt in one of these cases, he is to confess he has committed that sin."
Leviticus,5,6,He must bring his restitution for the sin he has committed to the LORD: a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for his sin.
Leviticus,5,7,"“But if he cannot afford an animal from the flock, then he may bring to the LORD two turtledoves or two young pigeons as restitution for his sin—one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"He is to bring them to the priest, who will first present the one for the sin offering. He must twist its head at the back of the neck without severing it."
Leviticus,5,9,"Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood is to be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,10,"He must prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the regulation. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,11,"“But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he may bring two quarts of fine flour as an offering for his sin. He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"He is to bring it to the priest, who will take a handful from it as its memorial portion and burn it on the altar along with the fire offerings to the LORD; it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,13,"In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf concerning the sin he has committed in any of these cases, and he will be forgiven. The rest will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.”"
Leviticus,5,14,Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,5,15,"“If someone offends by sinning unintentionally in regard to any of the LORD’s holy things, he must bring his restitution offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock (based on your assessment of its value in silver shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel) as a restitution offering."
Leviticus,5,16,"He must make restitution for his sin regarding any holy thing, adding a fifth of its value to it, and give it to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf with the ram of the restitution offering, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,17,"“If someone sins and without knowing it violates any of the LORD’s commands concerning anything prohibited, he bears the consequences of his guilt."
Leviticus,5,18,"He must bring an unblemished ram from the flock according to your assessment of its value as a restitution offering to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the error he has committed unintentionally, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a restitution offering; he is indeed guilty before the LORD.”
Leviticus,6,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,6,2,"“When someone sins and offends the LORD by deceiving his neighbor in regard to a deposit, a security, or a robbery; or defrauds his neighbor;"
Leviticus,6,3,or finds something lost and lies about it; or swears falsely about any of the sinful things a person may do—
Leviticus,6,4,"once he has sinned and acknowledged his guilt—he must return what he stole or defrauded, or the deposit entrusted to him, or the lost item he found,"
Leviticus,6,5,or anything else about which he swore falsely. He must make full restitution for it and add a fifth of its value to it. He is to pay it to its owner on the day he acknowledges his guilt.
Leviticus,6,6,Then he must bring his restitution offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock according to your assessment of its value as a restitution offering to the priest.
Leviticus,6,7,"In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done to incur guilt.”"
Leviticus,6,8,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,6,9,"“Command Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the burnt offering; the burnt offering itself must remain on the altar’s hearth all night until morning, while the fire of the altar is kept burning on it."
Leviticus,6,10,"The priest is to put on his linen robe and linen undergarments. He is to remove the ashes of the burnt offering the fire has consumed on the altar, and place them beside the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,"Then he must take off his garments, put on other clothes, and bring the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place."
Leviticus,6,12,The fire on the altar is to be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest will burn wood on the fire. He is to arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat portions from the fellowship offerings on it.
Leviticus,6,13,Fire must be kept burning on the altar continually; it must not go out.
Leviticus,6,14,“Now this is the law of the grain offering: Aaron’s sons will present it before the LORD in front of the altar.
Leviticus,6,15,"The priest is to remove a handful of fine flour and olive oil from the grain offering, with all the frankincense that is on the offering, and burn its memorial portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,16,Aaron and his sons may eat the rest of it. It is to be eaten in the form of unleavened bread in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,6,17,"It must not be baked with yeast; I have assigned it as their portion from My fire offerings. It is especially holy, like the sin offering and the restitution offering."
Leviticus,6,18,Any male among Aaron’s descendants may eat it. It is a permanent portion throughout your generations from the fire offerings to the LORD. Anything that touches the offerings will become holy.”
Leviticus,6,19,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,6,20,"“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD on the day that he is anointed: two quarts of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening."
Leviticus,6,21,"It is to be prepared with oil on a griddle; you are to bring it well-kneaded. You must present it as a grain offering of baked pieces, a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,22,"The priest, who is one of Aaron’s sons and will be anointed to take his place, is to prepare it. It must be completely burned as a permanent portion for the LORD."
Leviticus,6,23,Every grain offering for a priest will be a whole burnt offering; it is not to be eaten.”
Leviticus,6,24,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,6,25,“Tell Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the sin offering. The sin offering is most holy and must be slaughtered before the LORD at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest who offers it as a sin offering is to eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,6,27,"Anything that touches its flesh will become holy, and if any of its blood spatters on a garment, then you must wash that garment in a holy place."
Leviticus,6,28,"A clay pot in which the sin offering is boiled must be broken; if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it must be scoured and rinsed with water."
Leviticus,6,29,Any male among the priests may eat it; it is especially holy.
Leviticus,6,30,But no sin offering may be eaten if its blood has been brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place; it must be burned up.
Leviticus,7,1,“Now this is the law of the restitution offering; it is especially holy.
Leviticus,7,2,"The restitution offering must be slaughtered at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest is to sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"The offerer must present all the fat from it: the fat tail, the fat surrounding the entrails,"
Leviticus,7,4,and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins; he will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys.
Leviticus,7,5,The priest will burn them on the altar as a fire offering to the LORD; it is a restitution offering.
Leviticus,7,6,Any male among the priests may eat it. It is to be eaten in a holy place; it is especially holy.
Leviticus,7,7,“The restitution offering is like the sin offering; the law is the same for both. It belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.
Leviticus,7,8,"As for the priest who presents someone’s burnt offering, the hide of the burnt offering he has presented belongs to him; it is the priest’s."
Leviticus,7,9,Any grain offering that is baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it; it is his.
Leviticus,7,10,"But any grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all of Aaron’s sons."
Leviticus,7,11,“Now this is the law of the fellowship sacrifice that someone may present to the LORD:
Leviticus,7,12,"If he presents it for thanksgiving, in addition to the thanksgiving sacrifice, he is to present unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,7,13,He is to present as his offering cakes of leavened bread with his thanksgiving sacrifice of fellowship.
Leviticus,7,14,From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offering; it is his.
Leviticus,7,15,The meat of his thanksgiving sacrifice of fellowship must be eaten on the day he offers it; he may not leave any of it until morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"“If the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering, it is to be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, and what is left over may be eaten on the next day."
Leviticus,7,17,But what remains of the sacrificial meat by the third day must be burned up.
Leviticus,7,18,"If any of the meat of his fellowship sacrifice is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who presents it; it is repulsive. The person who eats any of it will be responsible for his sin."
Leviticus,7,19,“Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it is to be burned up. Everyone who is clean may eat any other meat.
Leviticus,7,20,"But the one who eats meat from the LORD’s fellowship sacrifice while he is unclean, that person must be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,21,"If someone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable creature, and eats meat from the LORD’s fellowship sacrifice, that person must be cut off from his people.”"
Leviticus,7,22,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,7,23,"“Tell the Israelites: You are not to eat any fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat."
Leviticus,7,24,"The fat of an animal that dies naturally or is mauled by wild beasts may be used for any purpose, but you must not eat it."
Leviticus,7,25,"If anyone eats animal fat from a fire offering presented to the LORD, the person who eats it must be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,26,"Wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal."
Leviticus,7,27,"Whoever eats any blood, that person must be cut off from his people.”"
Leviticus,7,28,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,7,29,“Tell the Israelites: The one who presents a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD must bring an offering to the LORD from his sacrifice.
Leviticus,7,30,His own hands will bring the fire offerings to the LORD. He will bring the fat together with the breast. The breast is to be waved as a presentation offering before the LORD.
Leviticus,7,31,"The priest is to burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons."
Leviticus,7,32,You are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your fellowship sacrifices.
Leviticus,7,33,The son of Aaron who presents the blood of the fellowship offering and the fat will have the right thigh as a portion.
Leviticus,7,34,"I have taken from the Israelites the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution from their fellowship sacrifices, and have assigned them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the Israelites.”"
Leviticus,7,35,This is the portion from the fire offerings to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.
Leviticus,7,36,The LORD commanded this to be given to them by the Israelites on the day He anointed them. It is a permanent portion throughout their generations.
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the law for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the restitution offering, the ordination offering, and the fellowship sacrifice,"
Leviticus,7,38,which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus,8,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,8,2,"“Take Aaron, his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,"
Leviticus,8,3,and assemble the whole community at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”
Leviticus,8,4,"So Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the community assembled at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,8,5,"Moses said to them, “This is what the LORD has commanded to be done.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Then Moses presented Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
Leviticus,8,7,"He put the tunic on Aaron, wrapped the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He put the woven band of the ephod around him and fastened it to him."
Leviticus,8,8,Then he put the breastpiece on him and placed the Urim and Thummim into the breastpiece.
Leviticus,8,9,"He also put the turban on his head and placed the gold medallion, the holy diadem, on the front of the turban, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it to consecrate them.
Leviticus,8,11,"He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them."
Leviticus,8,12,He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed and consecrated him.
Leviticus,8,13,"Then Moses presented Aaron’s sons, clothed them with tunics, wrapped sashes around them, and fastened headbands on them, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,"Then he brought the bull near for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering."
Leviticus,8,15,"Then Moses slaughtered it, took the blood, and applied it with his finger to the horns of the altar on all sides, purifying the altar. He poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it so that atonement can be made on it."
Leviticus,8,16,"Moses took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"He burned up the bull with its hide, flesh, and dung outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,"Then he presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,19,Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
Leviticus,8,20,"Moses cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the suet,"
Leviticus,8,21,"but he washed the entrails and shanks with water. He then burned the entire ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD as He had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"Next he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,23,"Moses slaughtered it, took some of its blood, and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"Moses also presented Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then Moses sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar."
Leviticus,8,25,"He took the fat—the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat—as well as the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,26,"From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat portions and the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,27,He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a presentation offering.
Leviticus,8,28,"Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,29,He also took the breast and waved it before the LORD as a presentation offering; it was Moses’ portion of the ordination ram as the LORD had commanded him.
Leviticus,8,30,"Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. In this way he consecrated Aaron and his garments, as well as his sons and their garments."
Leviticus,8,31,"Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket for the ordination offering as I commanded: Aaron and his sons are to eat it."
Leviticus,8,32,You must burn up what remains of the meat and bread.
Leviticus,8,33,"You must not go outside the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the time your days of ordination are completed, because it will take seven days to ordain you."
Leviticus,8,34,The LORD commanded what has been done today in order to make atonement for you.
Leviticus,8,35,"You must remain at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and keep the LORD’s charge so that you will not die, for this is what I was commanded.”"
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD had commanded through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,"On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel."
Leviticus,9,2,"He said to Aaron, “Take a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present them before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,3,"And tell the Israelites: Take a male goat for a sin offering; a calf and a lamb, male yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering;"
Leviticus,9,4,an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the LORD; and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD is going to appear to you.”
Leviticus,9,5,"They brought what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole community came forward and stood before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,6,"Moses said, “This is what the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering; make atonement for yourself and the people. Sacrifice the people’s offering and make atonement for them, as the LORD commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
Leviticus,9,9,"Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. He poured out the blood at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,9,10,"He burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver from the sin offering on the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,He burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron’s sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, along with the head, and he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,He washed the entrails and the shanks and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus,9,15,"Aaron presented the people’s offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and made a sin offering with it as he did before."
Leviticus,9,16,He presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it according to the regulation.
Leviticus,9,17,"Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering."
Leviticus,9,18,"Finally, he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people’s fellowship sacrifice. Aaron’s sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the fat surrounding the entrails, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver—"
Leviticus,9,20,"and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar,"
Leviticus,9,21,"but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a presentation offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. He came down after sacrificing the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the fellowship offering."
Leviticus,9,23,"Moses and Aaron then entered the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"Fire came from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell facedown on the ground."
Leviticus,10,1,"Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his own firepan, put fire in it, placed incense on it, and presented unauthorized fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them to do."
Leviticus,10,2,Then fire came from the LORD and burned them to death before the LORD.
Leviticus,10,3,"So Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD meant when He said: I will show My holiness to those who are near Me, and I will reveal My glory before all the people.” But Aaron remained silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here and carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.”"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they came forward and carried them in their tunics outside the camp, as Moses had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair hang loose and do not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will become angry with the whole community. However, your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn over that tragedy when the LORD sent the fire."
Leviticus,10,7,"You must not go outside the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, for the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said."
Leviticus,10,8,The LORD spoke to Aaron:
Leviticus,10,9,"“You and your sons are not to drink wine or beer when you enter the tent of meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute throughout your generations."
Leviticus,10,10,"You must distinguish between the holy and the common, and the clean and the unclean,"
Leviticus,10,11,and teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given to them through Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12,"Moses spoke to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: “Take the grain offering that is left over from the fire offerings to the LORD, and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar, because it is especially holy."
Leviticus,10,13,"You must eat it in a holy place because it is your portion and your sons’ from the fire offerings to the LORD, for this is what I was commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,"But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution in any ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the Israelites’ fellowship sacrifices."
Leviticus,10,15,"They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the presentation offering, together with the offerings of fat portions made by fire, to wave as a presentation offering before the LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the LORD commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,16,"Later, Moses inquired about the male goat of the sin offering, but it had already been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s surviving sons, and asked,"
Leviticus,10,17,"“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? For it is especially holy, and He has assigned it to you to take away the guilt of the community and make atonement for them before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,18,"Since its blood was not brought inside the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,19,"But Aaron replied to Moses, “See, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the LORD’s sight?”"
Leviticus,10,20,"When Moses heard this, it was acceptable to him."
Leviticus,11,1,The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Leviticus,11,2,“Tell the Israelites: You may eat all these kinds of land animals.
Leviticus,11,3,You may eat any animal with divided hooves and that chews the cud.
Leviticus,11,4,"But among the ones that chew the cud or have divided hooves you are not to eat these: the camel, though it chews the cud, does not have divided hooves—it is unclean for you;"
Leviticus,11,5,"the hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have hooves—it is unclean for you;"
Leviticus,11,6,"the hare, though it chews the cud, does not have hooves—it is unclean for you;"
Leviticus,11,7,"the pig, though it has divided hooves, does not chew the cud—it is unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,8,Do not eat any of their meat or touch their carcasses—they are unclean for you.
Leviticus,11,9,"“This is what you may eat from all that is in the water: You may eat everything in the water that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or streams."
Leviticus,11,10,But these are to be detestable to you: everything in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales among all the swarming things and other living creatures in the water.
Leviticus,11,11,"They are to remain detestable to you; you must not eat any of their meat, and you must detest their carcasses."
Leviticus,11,12,Everything in the water that does not have fins and scales will be detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,13,"“You are to detest these birds. They must not be eaten because they are detestable: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,"
Leviticus,11,14,"the kite, any kind of falcon,"
Leviticus,11,15,"every kind of raven,"
Leviticus,11,16,"the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,"
Leviticus,11,17,"the little owl, the cormorant, the long-eared owl,"
Leviticus,11,18,"the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,"
Leviticus,11,19,"the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,“All winged insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,21,But you may eat these kinds of all the winged insects that walk on all fours: those that have jointed legs above their feet for hopping on the ground.
Leviticus,11,22,"You may eat these: any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, and grasshopper."
Leviticus,11,23,All other winged insects that have four feet are to be detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,24,"“These will make you unclean. Whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening,"
Leviticus,11,25,and whoever carries any of their carcasses must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,26,All animals that have hooves but do not have a divided hoof and do not chew the cud are unclean for you. Whoever touches them becomes unclean.
Leviticus,11,27,"All the four-footed animals that walk on their paws are unclean for you. Whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening,"
Leviticus,11,28,and anyone who carries their carcasses must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening. They are unclean for you.
Leviticus,11,29,"“These creatures that swarm on the ground are unclean for you: the weasel, the mouse, any kind of large lizard,"
Leviticus,11,30,"the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the skink, and the chameleon."
Leviticus,11,31,These are unclean for you among all the swarming creatures. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,32,"When any one of them dies and falls on anything it becomes unclean—any item of wood, clothing, leather, sackcloth, or any implement used for work. It is to be rinsed with water and will remain unclean until evening; then it will be clean."
Leviticus,11,33,"If any of them falls into any clay pot, everything in it will become unclean; you must break it."
Leviticus,11,34,"Any edible food coming into contact with that unclean water will become unclean, and any drinkable liquid in any container will become unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"Anything one of their carcasses falls on will become unclean. If it is an oven or stove, it must be smashed; it is unclean and will remain unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,36,"A spring or cistern containing water will remain clean, but someone who touches a carcass in it will become unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"If one of their carcasses falls on any seed that is to be sown, it is clean;"
Leviticus,11,38,"but if water has been put on the seed and one of their carcasses falls on it, it is unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,39,"“If one of the animals that you use for food dies, anyone who touches its carcass will be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,40,Anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening. Anyone who carries its carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,41,“All the creatures that swarm on the earth are detestable; they must not be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,"Do not eat any of the creatures that swarm on the earth, anything that moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet, for they are detestable."
Leviticus,11,43,Do not become contaminated by any creature that swarms; do not become unclean or defiled by them.
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am Yahweh your God, so you must consecrate yourselves and be holy because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves by any swarming creature that crawls on the ground."
Leviticus,11,45,"For I am Yahweh, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, so you must be holy because I am holy."
Leviticus,11,46,"“This is the law concerning animals, birds, all living creatures that move in the water, and all creatures that swarm on the ground,"
Leviticus,11,47,"in order to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between the animals that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.”"
Leviticus,12,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,12,2,"“Tell the Israelites: When a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a male child, she will be unclean seven days, as she is during the days of her menstrual impurity."
Leviticus,12,3,The flesh of his foreskin must be circumcised on the eighth day.
Leviticus,12,4,She will continue in purification from her bleeding for 33 days. She must not touch any holy thing or go into the sanctuary until completing her days of purification.
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she gives birth to a female child, she will be unclean for two weeks as she is during her menstrual impurity. She will continue in purification from her bleeding for 66 days."
Leviticus,12,6,"“When her days of purification are complete, whether for a son or daughter, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting a year-old male lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering."
Leviticus,12,7,"He will present them before the LORD and make atonement on her behalf; she will be clean from her discharge of blood. This is the law for a woman giving birth, whether to a male or female."
Leviticus,12,8,"But if she doesn’t have sufficient means for a sheep, she may take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean.”"
Leviticus,13,1,The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Leviticus,13,2,"“When a person has a swelling, scab, or spot on the skin of his body, and it becomes a disease on the skin of his body, he is to be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests."
Leviticus,13,3,"The priest will examine the infection on the skin of his body. If the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a skin disease. After the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the spot on the skin of his body is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest must quarantine the infected person for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"The priest will then reexamine him on the seventh day. If he sees that the infection remains unchanged and has not spread on the skin, the priest must quarantine him for another seven days."
Leviticus,13,6,"The priest will examine him again on the seventh day. If the infection has faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest is to pronounce him clean; it is a scab. The person is to wash his clothes and will become clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the scab spreads further on his skin after he has presented himself to the priest for his cleansing, he must present himself again to the priest."
Leviticus,13,8,"The priest will examine him, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean; he has a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,9,"“When a skin disease develops on a person, he is to be brought to the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,"The priest will examine him. If there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is a patch of raw flesh in the swelling,"
Leviticus,13,11,"it is a chronic disease on the skin of his body, and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He need not quarantine him, for he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"But if the skin disease breaks out all over the skin so that it covers all the skin of the infected person from his head to his feet so far as the priest can see,"
Leviticus,13,13,"the priest will look, and if the skin disease has covered his entire body, he is to pronounce the infected person clean. Since he has turned totally white, he is clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he will be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"When the priest examines the raw flesh, he must pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean; it is a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,16,"But if the raw flesh changes and turns white, he must go to the priest."
Leviticus,13,17,"The priest will examine him, and if the infection has turned white, the priest must pronounce the infected person clean; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,18,"“When a boil appears on the skin of one’s body and it heals,"
Leviticus,13,19,"and a white swelling or a reddish-white spot develops where the boil was, the person must present himself to the priest."
Leviticus,13,20,"The priest will make an examination, and if the spot seems to be beneath the skin and the hair in it has turned white, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a skin disease that has broken out in the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But when the priest examines it, if there is no white hair in it, and it is not beneath the skin but is faded, the priest must quarantine him seven days."
Leviticus,13,22,"If it spreads further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is an infection."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the spot remains where it is and does not spread, it is only the scar from the boil. The priest is to pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"“When there is a burn on the skin of one’s body produced by fire, and the patch made raw by the burn becomes reddish-white or white,"
Leviticus,13,25,"the priest is to examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and the spot appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a skin disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,26,"But when the priest examines it, if there is no white hair in the spot and it is not beneath the skin but is faded, the priest must quarantine him seven days."
Leviticus,13,27,"The priest will reexamine him on the seventh day. If it has spread further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a skin disease."
Leviticus,13,28,"But if the spot has remained where it was and has not spread on the skin but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn. The priest is to pronounce him clean, for it is only the scar from the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,"“When a man or woman has an infection on the head or chin,"
Leviticus,13,30,"the priest must examine the infection. If it appears to be deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and sparse, the priest must pronounce the person unclean. It is a scaly outbreak, a skin disease of the head or chin."
Leviticus,13,31,"When the priest examines the scaly infection, if it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, the priest must quarantine the person with the scaly infection for seven days."
Leviticus,13,32,"The priest will reexamine the infection on the seventh day. If the scaly outbreak has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin,"
Leviticus,13,33,the person must shave himself but not shave the scaly area. Then the priest must quarantine the person who has the scaly outbreak for another seven days.
Leviticus,13,34,"The priest will examine the scaly outbreak on the seventh day, and if it has not spread on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, the priest is to pronounce the person clean. He is to wash his clothes, and he will be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,"But if the scaly outbreak spreads further on the skin after his cleansing,"
Leviticus,13,36,"the priest is to examine the person. If the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; the person is unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"But if as far as he can see, the scaly outbreak remains unchanged and black hair has grown in it, then it has healed; he is clean. The priest is to pronounce the person clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"“When a man or a woman has white spots on the skin of the body,"
Leviticus,13,39,"the priest is to make an examination. If the spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is only a rash that has broken out on the skin; the person is clean."
Leviticus,13,40,"“If a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald, but he is clean."
Leviticus,13,41,"Or if he loses the hair at his hairline, he is bald on his forehead, but he is clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"But if there is a reddish-white infection on the bald head or forehead, it is a skin disease breaking out on his head or forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"The priest is to examine him, and if the swelling of the infection on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white, like the appearance of a skin disease on his body,"
Leviticus,13,44,the man is afflicted with a skin disease; he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean; the infection is on his head.
Leviticus,13,45,"“The person afflicted with an infectious skin disease is to have his clothes torn and his hair hanging loose, and he must cover his mouth and cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’"
Leviticus,13,46,He will remain unclean as long as he has the infection; he is unclean. He must live alone in a place outside the camp.
Leviticus,13,47,"“If a fabric is contaminated with mildew—in wool or linen fabric,"
Leviticus,13,48,"in the warp or woof of linen or wool, or in leather or anything made of leather—"
Leviticus,13,49,"and if the contamination is green or red in the fabric, the leather, the warp, the woof, or any leather article, it is a mildew contamination and is to be shown to the priest."
Leviticus,13,50,The priest is to examine the contamination and quarantine the contaminated fabric for seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,"The priest is to reexamine the contamination on the seventh day. If it has spread in the fabric, the warp, the woof, or the leather, regardless of how it is used, the contamination is harmful mildew; it is unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"He is to burn the fabric, the warp or woof in wool or linen, or any leather article, which is contaminated. Since it is harmful mildew it must be burned up."
Leviticus,13,53,"“When the priest examines it, if the contamination has not spread in the fabric, the warp or woof, or any leather article,"
Leviticus,13,54,the priest is to order whatever is contaminated to be washed and quarantined for another seven days.
Leviticus,13,55,"After it has been washed, the priest is to reexamine the contamination. If the appearance of the contaminated article has not changed, it is unclean. Even though the contamination has not spread, you must burn up the fabric. It is a fungus on the front or back of the fabric."
Leviticus,13,56,"“If the priest examines it, and the contamination has faded after it has been washed, he must cut the contaminated section out of the fabric, the leather, or the warp or woof."
Leviticus,13,57,"But if it reappears in the fabric, the warp or woof, or any leather article, it has broken out again. You must burn up whatever is contaminated."
Leviticus,13,58,"But if the contamination disappears from the fabric, the warp or woof, or any leather article, which have been washed, it is to be washed again, and it will be clean."
Leviticus,13,59,"“This is the law concerning a mildew contamination in wool or linen fabric, warp or woof, or any leather article, in order to pronounce it clean or unclean.”"
Leviticus,14,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,14,2,"“This is the law concerning the person afflicted with a skin disease on the day of his cleansing. He is to be brought to the priest,"
Leviticus,14,3,"who will go outside the camp and examine him. If the skin disease has disappeared from the afflicted person,"
Leviticus,14,4,"the priest will order that two live clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the one who is to be cleansed."
Leviticus,14,5,Then the priest will order that one of the birds be slaughtered over fresh water in a clay pot.
Leviticus,14,6,"He is to take the live bird together with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and dip them all into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water."
Leviticus,14,7,He will then sprinkle the blood seven times on the one who is to be cleansed from the skin disease. He is to pronounce him clean and release the live bird over the open countryside.
Leviticus,14,8,"The one who is to be cleansed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe with water; he is clean. Afterward he may enter the camp, but he must remain outside his tent for seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"He is to shave off all his hair again on the seventh day: his head, his beard, his eyebrows, and the rest of his hair. He is to wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; he is clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"“On the eighth day he must take two unblemished male lambs, an unblemished year-old ewe lamb, a grain offering of three quarts of fine flour mixed with olive oil, and one-third of a quart of olive oil."
Leviticus,14,11,"The priest who performs the cleansing will place the person who is to be cleansed, together with these offerings, before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,14,12,"The priest is to take one male lamb and present it as a restitution offering, along with the one-third quart of olive oil, and he must wave them as a presentation offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,13,"He is to slaughter the male lamb at the place in the sanctuary area where the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered, for like the sin offering, the restitution offering belongs to the priest; it is especially holy."
Leviticus,14,14,"The priest is to take some of the blood from the restitution offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,14,15,Then the priest will take some of the one-third quart of olive oil and pour it into his left palm.
Leviticus,14,16,The priest will dip his right finger into the oil in his left palm and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,17,"From the oil remaining in his palm the priest will put some on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the restitution offering."
Leviticus,14,18,What is left of the oil in the priest’s palm he is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed. In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,19,The priest must sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering.
Leviticus,14,20,"The priest is to offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. The priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"“But if he is poor and cannot afford these, he is to take one male lamb for a restitution offering to be waved in order to make atonement for him, along with two quarts of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, one-third of a quart of olive oil,"
Leviticus,14,22,"and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whatever he can afford, one to be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,On the eighth day he is to bring these things for his cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,24,"The priest will take the male lamb for the restitution offering and the one-third quart of olive oil, and wave them as a presentation offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,14,25,"After he slaughters the male lamb for the restitution offering, the priest is to take some of the blood of the restitution offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,14,26,Then the priest will pour some of the oil into his left palm.
Leviticus,14,27,With his right finger the priest will sprinkle some of the oil in his left palm seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,28,"The priest will also put some of the oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the same place as the blood of the restitution offering."
Leviticus,14,29,What is left of the oil in the priest’s palm he is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed to make atonement for him before the LORD.
Leviticus,14,30,"He must then sacrifice one type of what he can afford, either the turtledoves or young pigeons,"
Leviticus,14,31,"one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, sacrificing what he can afford together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD for the one to be cleansed."
Leviticus,14,32,This is the law for someone who has a skin disease and cannot afford the cost of his cleansing.”
Leviticus,14,33,The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Leviticus,14,34,"“When you enter the land of Canaan that I am giving you as a possession, and I place a mildew contamination in a house in the land you possess,"
Leviticus,14,35,the owner of the house is to come and tell the priest: Something like mildew contamination has appeared in my house.
Leviticus,14,36,"The priest must order them to clear the house before he enters to examine the contamination, so that nothing in the house becomes unclean. Afterward the priest will come to examine the house."
Leviticus,14,37,"He will examine it, and if the contamination in the walls of the house consists of green or red indentations that appear to be beneath the surface of the wall,"
Leviticus,14,38,the priest is to go outside the house to its doorway and quarantine the house for seven days.
Leviticus,14,39,"The priest is to return on the seventh day and examine it. If the contamination has spread on the walls of the house,"
Leviticus,14,40,the priest must order that the stones with the contamination be pulled out and thrown into an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus,14,41,"He is to have the inside of the house completely scraped, and the plaster that is scraped off must be dumped in an unclean place outside the city."
Leviticus,14,42,Then they must take different stones to replace the former ones and take additional plaster to replaster the house.
Leviticus,14,43,"“If the contamination reappears in the house after the stones have been pulled out, and after the house has been scraped and replastered,"
Leviticus,14,44,"the priest must come and examine it. If the contamination has spread in the house, it is harmful mildew; the house is unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"It must be torn down with its stones, its beams, and all its plaster, and taken outside the city to an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,Whoever enters the house during any of the days the priest quarantines it will be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,14,47,"Whoever lies down in the house is to wash his clothes, and whoever eats in it is to wash his clothes."
Leviticus,14,48,"“But when the priest comes and examines it, if the contamination has not spread in the house after it was replastered, he is to pronounce the house clean because the contamination has disappeared."
Leviticus,14,49,"He is to take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop to purify the house,"
Leviticus,14,50,and he is to slaughter one of the birds over a clay pot containing fresh water.
Leviticus,14,51,"He will take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"He will purify the house with the blood of the bird, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn."
Leviticus,14,53,"Then he is to release the live bird into the open countryside outside the city. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean."
Leviticus,14,54,"“This is the law for any skin disease or mildew, for a scaly outbreak,"
Leviticus,14,55,"for mildew in clothing or on a house,"
Leviticus,14,56,"and for a swelling, scab, or spot,"
Leviticus,14,57,to determine when something is unclean or clean. This is the law regarding skin disease and mildew.”
Leviticus,15,1,The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any man has a discharge from his body, he is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"This is uncleanness of his discharge: Whether his body secretes the discharge or retains it, he is unclean. All the days that his body secretes or retains anything because of his discharge, he is unclean."
Leviticus,15,4,"Any bed the man with the discharge lies on will be unclean, and any furniture he sits on will be unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"Anyone who touches his bed is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,6,"Whoever sits on furniture that the man with the discharge was sitting on is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,7,"Whoever touches the body of the man with a discharge is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,8,"If the man with the discharge spits on anyone who is clean, he is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,9,Any saddle the man with the discharge rides on will be unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"Whoever touches anything that was under him will be unclean until evening, and whoever carries such things is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,11,"If the man with the discharge touches anyone without first rinsing his hands in water, the person who was touched is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,12,"Any clay pot that the man with the discharge touches must be broken, while any wooden utensil must be rinsed with water."
Leviticus,15,13,"“When the man with the discharge has been cured of it, he is to count seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe his body in fresh water; he will be clean."
Leviticus,15,14,"He must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons on the eighth day, come before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest."
Leviticus,15,15,"The priest is to sacrifice them, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the LORD because of his discharge."
Leviticus,15,16,"“When a man has an emission of semen, he is to bathe himself completely with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,17,"Any clothing or leather on which there is an emission of semen must be washed with water, and it will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,18,"If a man sleeps with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them are to bathe with water, and they will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,19,"“When a woman has a discharge, and it consists of blood from her body, she will be unclean because of her menstruation for seven days. Everyone who touches her will be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,20,"Anything she lies on during her menstruation will become unclean, and anything she sits on will become unclean."
Leviticus,15,21,"Everyone who touches her bed is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,22,"Everyone who touches any furniture she was sitting on is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,23,"If discharge is on the bed or the furniture she was sitting on, when he touches it he will be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"If a man sleeps with her, and blood from her menstruation gets on him, he will be unclean for seven days, and every bed he lies on will become unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"“When a woman has a discharge of her blood for many days, though it is not the time of her menstruation, or if she has a discharge beyond her period, she will be unclean all the days of her unclean discharge, as she is during the days of her menstruation."
Leviticus,15,26,Any bed she lies on during the days of her discharge will be like her bed during menstrual impurity; any furniture she sits on will be unclean as in her menstrual period.
Leviticus,15,27,"Everyone who touches them will be unclean; he must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"When she is cured of her discharge, she is to count seven days, and after that she will be clean."
Leviticus,15,29,On the eighth day she must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,15,30,The priest is to sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her before the LORD because of her unclean discharge.
Leviticus,15,31,"“You must keep the Israelites from their uncleanness, so that they do not die by defiling My tabernacle that is among them."
Leviticus,15,32,"This is the law for someone with a discharge: a man who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean by it;"
Leviticus,15,33,"a woman who is in her menstrual period; anyone who has a discharge, whether male or female; and a man who sleeps with an unclean woman.”"
Leviticus,16,1,The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of two of Aaron’s sons when they approached the presence of the LORD and died.
Leviticus,16,2,"The LORD said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron that he may not come whenever he wants into the holy place behind the veil in front of the mercy seat on the ark or else he will die, because I appear in the cloud above the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,3,“Aaron is to enter the most holy place in this way: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,"He is to wear a holy linen tunic, and linen undergarments are to be on his body. He must tie a linen sash around him and wrap his head with a linen turban. These are holy garments; he must bathe his body with water before he wears them."
Leviticus,16,5,He is to take from the Israelite community two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,“Aaron will present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household.
Leviticus,16,7,Next he will take the two goats and place them before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,"After Aaron casts lots for the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other for azazel,"
Leviticus,16,9,he is to present the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it as a sin offering.
Leviticus,16,10,But the goat chosen by lot for azazel is to be presented alive before the LORD to make purification with it by sending it into the wilderness for azazel.
Leviticus,16,11,"“When Aaron presents the bull for his sin offering and makes atonement for himself and his household, he will slaughter the bull for his sin offering."
Leviticus,16,12,"Then he must take a firepan full of fiery coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring them inside the veil."
Leviticus,16,13,"He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, so that the cloud of incense covers the mercy seat that is over the testimony, or else he will die."
Leviticus,16,14,He is to take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger against the east side of the mercy seat; then he will sprinkle some of the blood with his finger before the mercy seat seven times.
Leviticus,16,15,"“When he slaughters the male goat for the people’s sin offering and brings its blood inside the veil, he must do the same with its blood as he did with the bull’s blood: he is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it."
Leviticus,16,16,"He will purify the most holy place in this way for all their sins because of the Israelites’ impurities and rebellious acts. He will do the same for the tent of meeting that remains among them, because it is surrounded by their impurities."
Leviticus,16,17,"No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the most holy place until he leaves after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole assembly of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,Then he will go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on the horns on all sides of the altar.
Leviticus,16,19,He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse and set it apart from the Israelites’ impurities.
Leviticus,16,20,"“When he has finished purifying the most holy place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he is to present the live male goat."
Leviticus,16,21,Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the Israelites’ wrongdoings and rebellious acts—all their sins. He is to put them on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the man appointed for the task.
Leviticus,16,22,"The goat will carry on it all their wrongdoings into a desolate land, and he will release it there."
Leviticus,16,23,"“Then Aaron is to enter the tent of meeting, take off the linen garments he wore when he entered the most holy place, and leave them there."
Leviticus,16,24,He will bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes. Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering; he will make atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus,16,25,He is to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,The man who released the goat for azazel is to wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; afterward he may reenter the camp.
Leviticus,16,27,"The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the most holy place to make atonement, must be brought outside the camp and their hide, flesh, and dung burned up."
Leviticus,16,28,The one who burns them is to wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may reenter the camp.
Leviticus,16,29,"“This is to be a permanent statute for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month you are to practice self-denial and do no work, both the native and the foreigner who resides among you."
Leviticus,16,30,"Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD."
Leviticus,16,31,"It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must practice self-denial; it is a permanent statute."
Leviticus,16,32,"The priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as high priest in place of his father will make atonement. He will put on the linen garments, the holy garments,"
Leviticus,16,33,and purify the most holy place. He will purify the tent of meeting and the altar and will make atonement for the priests and all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus,16,34,"This is to be a permanent statute for you, to make atonement for the Israelites once a year because of all their sins.” And all this was done as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,17,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,17,2,"“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them: This is what the LORD has commanded:"
Leviticus,17,3,"Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, sheep, or goat in the camp, or slaughters it outside the camp,"
Leviticus,17,4,instead of bringing it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD before His tabernacle—that person will be considered guilty. He has shed blood and must be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,17,5,This is so the Israelites will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they have been offering in the open country. They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting and offer them as fellowship sacrifices to the LORD.
Leviticus,17,6,The priest will then sprinkle the blood on the LORD’s altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus,17,7,They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat-demons that they have prostituted themselves with. This will be a permanent statute for them throughout their generations.
Leviticus,17,8,“Say to them: Anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners who live among them who offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
Leviticus,17,9,"but does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,17,10,"“Anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners who live among them who eats any blood, I will turn against that person who eats blood and cut him off from his people."
Leviticus,17,11,"For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have appointed it to you to make atonement on the altar for your lives, since it is the lifeblood that makes atonement."
Leviticus,17,12,Therefore I say to the Israelites: None of you and no foreigner who lives among you may eat blood.
Leviticus,17,13,"“Any Israelite or foreigner living among them, who hunts down a wild animal or bird that may be eaten must drain its blood and cover it with dirt."
Leviticus,17,14,"Since the life of every creature is its blood, I have told the Israelites: You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; whoever eats it must be cut off."
Leviticus,17,15,"“Every person, whether the native or the foreigner, who eats an animal that died a natural death or was mauled by wild beasts is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening; then he will be clean."
Leviticus,17,16,"But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself, he will bear his punishment.”"
Leviticus,18,1,Yahweh spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,18,2,“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,18,3,"Do not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, or follow the practices of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You must not follow their customs."
Leviticus,18,4,You are to practice My ordinances and you are to keep My statutes by following them; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,18,5,Keep My statutes and ordinances; a person will live if he does them. I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,18,6,“You are not to come near any close relative for sexual intercourse; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,18,7,You are not to shame your father by having sex with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual intercourse with her.
Leviticus,18,8,You are not to have sex with your father’s wife; it will shame your father.
Leviticus,18,9,"You are not to have sexual intercourse with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s, whether born at home or born elsewhere. You are not to have sex with her."
Leviticus,18,10,"You are not to have sexual intercourse with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, because it will shame your family."
Leviticus,18,11,"You are not to have sexual intercourse with your father’s wife’s daughter, who is adopted by your father; she is your sister."
Leviticus,18,12,You are not to have sexual intercourse with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.
Leviticus,18,13,"You are not to have sexual intercourse with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative."
Leviticus,18,14,You are not to shame your father’s brother by coming near his wife to have sexual intercourse; she is your aunt.
Leviticus,18,15,You are not to have sexual intercourse with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you are not to have sex with her.
Leviticus,18,16,You are not to have sexual intercourse with your brother’s wife; it will shame your brother.
Leviticus,18,17,You are not to have sexual intercourse with a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sex with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved.
Leviticus,18,18,You are not to marry a woman as a rival to her sister and have sexual intercourse with her during her sister’s lifetime.
Leviticus,18,19,“You are not to come near a woman during her menstrual impurity to have sexual intercourse with her.
Leviticus,18,20,"You are not to have sexual intercourse with your neighbor’s wife, defiling yourself with her."
Leviticus,18,21,“You are not to make any of your children pass through the fire to Molech. Do not profane the name of your God; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,18,22,You are not to sleep with a man as with a woman; it is detestable.
Leviticus,18,23,"You are not to have sexual intercourse with any animal, defiling yourself with it; a woman is not to present herself to an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion."
Leviticus,18,24,"“Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves by all these things."
Leviticus,18,25,"The land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants."
Leviticus,18,26,But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances. You must not commit any of these detestable things—not the native or the foreigner who lives among you.
Leviticus,18,27,"For the men who were in the land prior to you have committed all these detestable things, and the land has become defiled."
Leviticus,18,28,"If you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it has vomited out the nations that were before you."
Leviticus,18,29,Any person who does any of these detestable practices must be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,18,30,"You must keep My instruction to not do any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them; I am Yahweh your God.”"
Leviticus,19,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,19,2,"“Speak to the entire Israelite community and tell them: Be holy because I, Yahweh your God, am holy."
Leviticus,19,3,“Each of you is to respect his mother and father. You are to keep My Sabbaths; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,19,4,Do not turn to idols or make cast images of gods for yourselves; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,19,5,"“When you offer a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD, sacrifice it so that you may be accepted."
Leviticus,19,6,"It is to be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day, but what remains on the third day must be burned up."
Leviticus,19,7,"If any is eaten on the third day, it is a repulsive thing; it will not be accepted."
Leviticus,19,8,"Anyone who eats it will bear his punishment, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person must be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,19,9,"“When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap to the very edge of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest."
Leviticus,19,10,You must not strip your vineyard bare or gather its fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,19,11,“You must not steal. You must not act deceptively or lie to one another.
Leviticus,19,12,"You must not swear falsely by My name, profaning the name of your God; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,13,“You must not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages due a hired hand must not remain with you until morning.
Leviticus,19,14,"You must not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but you are to fear your God; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,15,“You must not act unjustly when deciding a case. Do not be partial to the poor or give preference to the rich; judge your neighbor fairly.
Leviticus,19,16,You must not go about spreading slander among your people; you must not jeopardize your neighbor’s life; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,19,17,"“You must not harbor hatred against your brother. Rebuke your neighbor directly, and you will not incur guilt because of him."
Leviticus,19,18,"Do not take revenge or bear a grudge against members of your community, but love your neighbor as yourself; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,19,"“You are to keep My statutes. You must not crossbreed two different kinds of your livestock, sow your fields with two kinds of seed, or put on a garment made of two kinds of material."
Leviticus,19,20,"“If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who is a slave designated for another man, but she has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be punishment. They are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed."
Leviticus,19,21,"However, he must bring a ram as his restitution offering to the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,19,22,"The priest will make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the restitution offering for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven for the sin he committed."
Leviticus,19,23,"“When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you are to consider the fruit forbidden. It will be forbidden to you for three years; it is not to be eaten."
Leviticus,19,24,In the fourth year all its fruit must be consecrated as a praise offering to the LORD.
Leviticus,19,25,But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit. In this way its yield will increase for you; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,19,26,“You are not to eat anything with blood in it. You are not to practice divination or sorcery.
Leviticus,19,27,You are not to cut off the hair at the sides of your head or mar the edge of your beard.
Leviticus,19,28,You are not to make gashes on your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,19,29,"“Do not debase your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will be prostituted and filled with depravity."
Leviticus,19,30,You must keep My Sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,19,31,"“Do not turn to mediums or consult spiritists, or you will be defiled by them; I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,19,32,“You are to rise in the presence of the elderly and honor the old. Fear your God; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,19,33,"“When a foreigner lives with you in your land, you must not oppress him."
Leviticus,19,34,"You must regard the foreigner who lives with you as the native-born among you. You are to love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,19,35,"“You must not be unfair in measurements of length, weight, or volume."
Leviticus,19,36,"You are to have honest balances, honest weights, an honest dry measure, and an honest liquid measure; I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt."
Leviticus,19,37,You must keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them; I am Yahweh.”
Leviticus,20,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,20,2,“Say to the Israelites: Any Israelite or foreigner living in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech must be put to death; the people of the country are to stone him.
Leviticus,20,3,"I will turn against that man and cut him off from his people, because he gave his offspring to Molech, defiling My sanctuary and profaning My holy name."
Leviticus,20,4,"But if the people of the country look the other way when that man gives any of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death,"
Leviticus,20,5,"then I will turn against that man and his family, and cut off from their people both him and all who follow him in prostituting themselves with Molech."
Leviticus,20,6,"“Whoever turns to mediums or spiritists and prostitutes himself with them, I will turn against that person and cut him off from his people."
Leviticus,20,7,"Consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,20,8,Keep My statutes and do them; I am Yahweh who sets you apart.
Leviticus,20,9,"“If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death. He has cursed his father or mother; his blood is on his own hands."
Leviticus,20,10,If a man commits adultery with a married woman—if he commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife—both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.
Leviticus,20,11,"If a man sleeps with his father’s wife, he has shamed his father. Both of them must be put to death; their blood is on their own hands."
Leviticus,20,12,"If a man sleeps with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death. They have acted perversely; their blood is on their own hands."
Leviticus,20,13,"If a man sleeps with a man as with a woman, they have both committed a detestable thing. They must be put to death; their blood is on their own hands."
Leviticus,20,14,"If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is depraved. Both he and they must be burned with fire, so that there will be no depravity among you."
Leviticus,20,15,"If a man has sexual intercourse with an animal, he must be put to death; you are also to kill the animal."
Leviticus,20,16,"If a woman comes near any animal and mates with it, you are to kill the woman and the animal. They must be put to death; their own blood is on them."
Leviticus,20,17,"If a man marries his sister, whether his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off publicly from their people. He has had sexual intercourse with his sister; he will bear his punishment."
Leviticus,20,18,"If a man sleeps with a menstruating woman and has sexual intercourse with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has uncovered the source of her blood. Both of them must be cut off from their people."
Leviticus,20,19,"You must not have sexual intercourse with your mother’s sister or your father’s sister, for it is exposing one’s own blood relative; both people will bear their punishment."
Leviticus,20,20,"If a man sleeps with his aunt, he has shamed his uncle; they will bear their guilt and die childless."
Leviticus,20,21,"If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is impurity. He has shamed his brother; they will be childless."
Leviticus,20,22,"“You are to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them, so that the land where I am bringing you to live will not vomit you out."
Leviticus,20,23,"You must not follow the statutes of the nations I am driving out before you, for they did all these things, and I abhorred them."
Leviticus,20,24,"And I promised you: You will inherit their land, since I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Yahweh your God who set you apart from the peoples."
Leviticus,20,25,"Therefore you must distinguish the clean animal from the unclean one, and the unclean bird from the clean one. Do not become contaminated by any land animal, bird, or whatever crawls on the ground; I have set these apart as unclean for you."
Leviticus,20,26,"You are to be holy to Me because I, Yahweh, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be Mine."
Leviticus,20,27,A man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist must be put to death. They are to be stoned; their blood is on their own hands.”
Leviticus,21,1,"The LORD said to Moses: “Speak to Aaron’s sons, the priests, and tell them: A priest is not to make himself ceremonially unclean for a dead person among his relatives,"
Leviticus,21,2,"except for his immediate family: his mother, father, son, daughter, or brother."
Leviticus,21,3,He may make himself unclean for his young unmarried sister in his immediate family.
Leviticus,21,4,He is not to make himself unclean for those related to him by marriage and so defile himself.
Leviticus,21,5,"“Priests may not make bald spots on their heads, shave the edge of their beards, or make gashes on their bodies."
Leviticus,21,6,"They are to be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. For they present the fire offerings to Yahweh, the food of their God, and they must be holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"They are not to marry a woman defiled by prostitution. They are not to marry one divorced by her husband, for the priest is holy to his God."
Leviticus,21,8,"You are to consider him holy since he presents the food of your God. He will be holy to you because I, Yahweh who sets you apart, am holy."
Leviticus,21,9,"If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by promiscuity, she defiles her father; she must be burned up."
Leviticus,21,10,"“The priest who is highest among his brothers, who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been ordained to wear the garments, must not dishevel his hair or tear his garments."
Leviticus,21,11,He must not go near any dead person or make himself unclean even for his father or mother.
Leviticus,21,12,"He must not leave the sanctuary or he will desecrate the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,21,13,“He is to marry a woman who is a virgin.
Leviticus,21,14,"He is not to marry a widow, a divorced woman, or one defiled by prostitution. He is to marry a virgin from his own people,"
Leviticus,21,15,"so that he does not corrupt his bloodline among his people, for I am Yahweh who sets him apart.”"
Leviticus,21,16,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,21,17,“Tell Aaron: None of your descendants throughout your generations who has a physical defect is to come near to present the food of his God.
Leviticus,21,18,"No man who has any defect is to come near: no man who is blind, lame, facially disfigured, or deformed;"
Leviticus,21,19,"no man who has a broken foot or hand,"
Leviticus,21,20,"or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has an eye defect, a festering rash, scabs, or a crushed testicle."
Leviticus,21,21,No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a defect is to come near to present the fire offerings to the LORD. He has a defect and is not to come near to present the food of his God.
Leviticus,21,22,He may eat the food of his God from what is especially holy as well as from what is holy.
Leviticus,21,23,"But because he has a defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar. He is not to desecrate My sanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who sets them apart.”"
Leviticus,21,24,Moses said this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
Leviticus,22,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,22,2,"“Tell Aaron and his sons to deal respectfully with the holy offerings of the Israelites that they have consecrated to Me, so they do not profane My holy name; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,3,"Say to them: If any man from any of your descendants throughout your generations is in a state of uncleanness yet approaches the holy offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person will be cut off from My presence; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,4,"No man of Aaron’s descendants who has a skin disease or a discharge is to eat from the holy offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything made unclean by a dead person or by a man who has an emission of semen,"
Leviticus,22,5,or whoever touches any swarming creature that makes him unclean or any person who makes him unclean—whatever his uncleanness—
Leviticus,22,6,the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening and is not to eat from the holy offerings unless he has bathed his body with water.
Leviticus,22,7,"When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the holy offerings, for that is his food."
Leviticus,22,8,"He must not eat an animal that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts, making himself unclean by it; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,9,"They must keep My instruction, or they will be guilty and die because they profane it; I am Yahweh who sets them apart."
Leviticus,22,10,“No one outside a priest’s family is to eat the holy offering. A foreigner staying with a priest or a hired hand is not to eat the holy offering.
Leviticus,22,11,"But if a priest purchases someone with his money, that person may eat it, and those born in his house may eat his food."
Leviticus,22,12,"If the priest’s daughter is married to a man outside a priest’s family, she is not to eat from the holy contributions."
Leviticus,22,13,"But if the priest’s daughter becomes widowed or divorced, has no children, and returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she may share her father’s food. But no outsider may share it."
Leviticus,22,14,"If anyone eats a holy offering in error, he must add a fifth to its value and give the holy offering to the priest."
Leviticus,22,15,The priests must not profane the holy offerings the Israelites give to the LORD
Leviticus,22,16,by letting the people eat their holy offerings and having them bear the penalty of restitution. For I am Yahweh who sets them apart.”
Leviticus,22,17,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,22,18,"“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them: Any man of the house of Israel or of the foreign residents in Israel who presents his offering—whether they present freewill gifts or payment of vows to the LORD as burnt offerings—"
Leviticus,22,19,"must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for you to be accepted."
Leviticus,22,20,"You are not to present anything that has a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf."
Leviticus,22,21,"“When a man presents a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or flock, it has to be unblemished to be acceptable; there must be no defect in it."
Leviticus,22,22,"You are not to present any animal to the LORD that is blind, injured, maimed, or has a running sore, festering rash, or scabs; you may not put any of them on the altar as a fire offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,23,"You may sacrifice as a freewill offering any animal from the herd or flock that has an elongated or stunted limb, but it is not acceptable as a vow offering."
Leviticus,22,24,"You are not to present to the LORD anything that has bruised, crushed, torn, or severed testicles; you must not sacrifice them in your land."
Leviticus,22,25,Neither you nor a foreigner are to present food to your God from any of these animals. They will not be accepted for you because they are deformed and have a defect.”
Leviticus,22,26,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,22,27,"“When an ox, sheep, or goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days; from the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a gift, a fire offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,28,But you are not to slaughter an animal from the herd or flock on the same day as its young.
Leviticus,22,29,"When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, sacrifice it so that you may be accepted."
Leviticus,22,30,It is to be eaten on the same day. Do not let any of it remain until morning; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,22,31,“You are to keep My commands and do them; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,22,32,"You must not profane My holy name; I must be treated as holy among the Israelites. I am Yahweh who sets you apart,"
Leviticus,22,33,the One who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Yahweh.”
Leviticus,23,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,23,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: These are My appointed times, the times of the LORD that you will proclaim as sacred assemblies."
Leviticus,23,3,"“Work may be done for six days, but on the seventh day there must be a Sabbath of complete rest, a sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; it is a Sabbath to the LORD wherever you live."
Leviticus,23,4,"“These are the LORD’s appointed times, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times."
Leviticus,23,5,"The Passover to the LORD comes in the first month, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the month."
Leviticus,23,6,The Festival of Unleavened Bread to the LORD is on the fifteenth day of the same month. For seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus,23,7,On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly; you are not to do any daily work.
Leviticus,23,8,You are to present a fire offering to the LORD for seven days. On the seventh day there will be a sacred assembly; you must not do any daily work.”
Leviticus,23,9,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you and reap its harvest, you are to bring the first sheaf of your harvest to the priest."
Leviticus,23,11,He will wave the sheaf before the LORD so that you may be accepted; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
Leviticus,23,12,"On the day you wave the sheaf, you are to offer a year-old male lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,13,"Its grain offering is to be four quarts of fine flour mixed with oil as a fire offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, and its drink offering will be one quart of wine."
Leviticus,23,14,"You must not eat bread, roasted grain, or any new grain until this very day, and until you have brought the offering to your God. This is to be a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you live."
Leviticus,23,15,"“You are to count seven complete weeks starting from the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the presentation offering."
Leviticus,23,16,You are to count 50 days until the day after the seventh Sabbath and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
Leviticus,23,17,"Bring two loaves of bread from your settlements as a presentation offering, each of them made from four quarts of fine flour, baked with yeast, as firstfruits to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,18,"You are to present with the bread seven unblemished male lambs a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offerings and drink offerings, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,19,"You are also to prepare one male goat as a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a fellowship sacrifice."
Leviticus,23,20,The priest will wave the lambs with the bread of firstfruits as a presentation offering before the LORD; the bread and the two lambs will be holy to the LORD for the priest.
Leviticus,23,21,On that same day you are to make a proclamation and hold a sacred assembly. You are not to do any daily work. This is to be a permanent statute wherever you live throughout your generations.
Leviticus,23,22,"When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap all the way to the edge of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident; I am Yahweh your God.”"
Leviticus,23,23,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,23,24,"“Tell the Israelites: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you are to have a day of complete rest, commemoration, and joyful shouting—a sacred assembly."
Leviticus,23,25,"You must not do any daily work, but you must present a fire offering to the LORD.”"
Leviticus,23,26,The LORD again spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,23,27,“The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. You are to hold a sacred assembly and practice self-denial; you are to present a fire offering to the LORD.
Leviticus,23,28,"On this particular day you are not to do any work, for it is a Day of Atonement to make atonement for yourselves before the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,29,"If any person does not practice self-denial on this particular day, he must be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,23,30,I will destroy among his people anyone who does any work on this same day.
Leviticus,23,31,You are not to do any work. This is a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you live.
Leviticus,23,32,"It will be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must practice self-denial. You are to observe your Sabbath from the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening.”"
Leviticus,23,33,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,23,34,“Tell the Israelites: The Festival of Booths to the LORD begins on the fifteenth day of this seventh month and continues for seven days.
Leviticus,23,35,There is to be a sacred assembly on the first day; you are not to do any daily work.
Leviticus,23,36,You are to present a fire offering to the LORD for seven days. On the eighth day you are to hold a sacred assembly and present a fire offering to the LORD. It is a solemn gathering; you are not to do any daily work.
Leviticus,23,37,"“These are the LORD’s appointed times that you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for presenting fire offerings to the LORD, burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its designated day."
Leviticus,23,38,"These are in addition to the offerings for the LORD’s Sabbaths, your gifts, all your vow offerings, and all your freewill offerings that you give to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,39,“You are to celebrate the LORD’s festival on the fifteenth day of the seventh month for seven days after you have gathered the produce of the land. There will be complete rest on the first day and complete rest on the eighth day.
Leviticus,23,40,"On the first day you are to take the product of majestic trees—palm fronds, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook—and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,You are to celebrate it as a festival to the LORD seven days each year. This is a permanent statute for you throughout your generations; you must celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,"You are to live in booths for seven days. All the native-born of Israel must live in booths,"
Leviticus,23,43,so that your generations may know that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God.”
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses declared the LORD’s appointed times to the Israelites.
Leviticus,24,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,24,2,"“Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil from crushed olives for the light, in order to keep the lamp burning continually."
Leviticus,24,3,Aaron is to tend it continually from evening until morning before the LORD outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting. This is a permanent statute throughout your generations.
Leviticus,24,4,He must continually tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand in the LORD’s presence.
Leviticus,24,5,“Take fine flour and bake it into 12 loaves; each loaf is to be made with four quarts.
Leviticus,24,6,"Arrange them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD."
Leviticus,24,7,"Place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread and a fire offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,24,8,The bread is to be set out before the LORD every Sabbath day as a perpetual covenant obligation on the part of the Israelites.
Leviticus,24,9,"It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, for it is the holiest portion for him from the fire offerings to the LORD; this is a permanent rule.”"
Leviticus,24,10,Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father was among the Israelites. A fight broke out in the camp between the Israelite woman’s son and an Israelite man.
Leviticus,24,11,"Her son cursed and blasphemed the Name, and they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, a daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.)"
Leviticus,24,12,They put him in custody until the LORD’s decision could be made clear to them.
Leviticus,24,13,Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,24,14,“Bring the one who has cursed to the outside of the camp and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole community stone him.
Leviticus,24,15,"And tell the Israelites: If anyone curses his God, he will bear the consequences of his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"Whoever blasphemes the name of Yahweh is to be put to death; the whole community must stone him. If he blasphemes the Name, he is to be put to death, whether the foreign resident or the native."
Leviticus,24,17,"“If a man kills anyone, he must be put to death."
Leviticus,24,18,"Whoever kills an animal is to make restitution for it, life for life."
Leviticus,24,19,"If any man inflicts a permanent injury on his neighbor, whatever he has done is to be done to him:"
Leviticus,24,20,"fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Whatever injury he inflicted on the person, the same is to be inflicted on him."
Leviticus,24,21,"Whoever kills an animal is to make restitution for it, but whoever kills a person is to be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,"You are to have the same law for the foreign resident and the native, because I am Yahweh your God.”"
Leviticus,24,23,"After Moses spoke to the Israelites, they brought the one who had cursed to the outside of the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai:
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you, the land will observe a Sabbath to the LORD."
Leviticus,25,3,"You may sow your field for six years, and you may prune your vineyard and gather its produce for six years."
Leviticus,25,4,"But there will be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land in the seventh year, a Sabbath to the LORD: you are not to sow your field or prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"You are not to reap what grows by itself from your crop, or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. It must be a year of complete rest for the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"Whatever the land produces during the Sabbath year can be food for you—for yourself, your male or female slave, and the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you."
Leviticus,25,7,All of its growth may serve as food for your livestock and the wild animals in your land.
Leviticus,25,8,"“You are to count seven sabbatical years, seven times seven years, so that the time period of the seven sabbatical years amounts to 49."
Leviticus,25,9,"Then you are to sound a trumpet loudly in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month; you will sound it throughout your land on the Day of Atonement."
Leviticus,25,10,"You are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all its inhabitants. It will be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and each of you to his clan."
Leviticus,25,11,"The fiftieth year will be your Jubilee; you are not to sow, reap what grows by itself, or harvest its untended vines."
Leviticus,25,12,It is to be holy to you because it is the Jubilee; you may only eat its produce directly from the field.
Leviticus,25,13,"“In this Year of Jubilee, each of you will return to his property."
Leviticus,25,14,"If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him, do not cheat one another."
Leviticus,25,15,You are to make the purchase from your neighbor based on the number of years since the last Jubilee. He is to sell to you based on the number of remaining harvest years.
Leviticus,25,16,"You are to increase its price in proportion to a greater amount of years, and decrease its price in proportion to a lesser amount of years, because what he is selling to you is a number of harvests."
Leviticus,25,17,"You are not to cheat one another, but fear your God, for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"“You are to keep My statutes and ordinances and carefully observe them, so that you may live securely in the land."
Leviticus,25,19,"Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat, be satisfied, and live securely in the land."
Leviticus,25,20,If you wonder: ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we don’t sow or gather our produce?’
Leviticus,25,21,"I will appoint My blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years."
Leviticus,25,22,"When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating from the previous harvest. You will be eating this until the ninth year when its harvest comes in."
Leviticus,25,23,"“The land is not to be permanently sold because it is Mine, and you are only foreigners and temporary residents on My land."
Leviticus,25,24,You are to allow the redemption of any land you occupy.
Leviticus,25,25,"If your brother becomes destitute and sells part of his property, his nearest relative may come and redeem what his brother has sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"If a man has no family redeemer, but he prospers and obtains enough to redeem his land,"
Leviticus,25,27,"he may calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man he sold it to, and return to his property."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in the possession of its purchaser until the Year of Jubilee. It is to be released at the Jubilee, so that he may return to his property."
Leviticus,25,29,"“If a man sells a residence in a walled city, his right of redemption will last until a year has passed after its sale; his right of redemption will last a year."
Leviticus,25,30,"If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its purchaser throughout his generations. It is not to be released on the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"But houses in villages that have no walls around them are to be classified as open fields. The right to redeem such houses stays in effect, and they are to be released at the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"“Concerning the Levitical cities, the Levites always have the right to redeem houses in the cities they possess."
Leviticus,25,33,"Whatever property one of the Levites can redeem—a house sold in a city they possess—must be released at the Jubilee, because the houses in the Levitical cities are their possession among the Israelites."
Leviticus,25,34,"The open pastureland around their cities may not be sold, for it is their permanent possession."
Leviticus,25,35,"“If your brother becomes destitute and cannot sustain himself among you, you are to support him as a foreigner or temporary resident, so that he can continue to live among you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Do not profit or take interest from him, but fear your God and let your brother live among you."
Leviticus,25,37,You are not to lend him your silver with interest or sell him your food for profit.
Leviticus,25,38,"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"“If your brother among you becomes destitute and sells himself to you, you must not force him to do slave labor."
Leviticus,25,40,Let him stay with you as a hired hand or temporary resident; he may work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus,25,41,"Then he and his children are to be released from you, and he may return to his clan and his ancestral property."
Leviticus,25,42,"They are not to be sold as slaves, because they are My slaves that I brought out of the land of Egypt."
Leviticus,25,43,You are not to rule over them harshly but fear your God.
Leviticus,25,44,Your male and female slaves are to be from the nations around you; you may purchase male and female slaves.
Leviticus,25,45,"You may also purchase them from the foreigners staying with you, or from their families living among you—those born in your land. These may become your property."
Leviticus,25,46,"You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But concerning your brothers, the Israelites, you must not rule over one another harshly."
Leviticus,25,47,"“If a foreigner or temporary resident living among you prospers, but your brother living near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner living among you, or to a member of the foreigner’s clan,"
Leviticus,25,48,he has the right of redemption after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him.
Leviticus,25,49,"His uncle or cousin may redeem him, or any of his close relatives from his clan may redeem him. If he prospers, he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,The one who purchased him is to calculate the time from the year he sold himself to him until the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years. It will be set for him like the daily wages of a hired hand.
Leviticus,25,51,"If many years are still left, he must pay his redemption price in proportion to them based on his purchase price."
Leviticus,25,52,"If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he will calculate and pay the price of his redemption in proportion to his remaining years."
Leviticus,25,53,He will stay with him like a man hired year by year. A foreign owner is not to rule over him harshly in your sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"If he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children are to be released at the Year of Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,55,For the Israelites are My slaves. They are My slaves that I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"“Do not make idols for yourselves, set up a carved image or sacred pillar for yourselves, or place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,26,2,You must keep My Sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,26,3,"“If you follow My statutes and faithfully observe My commands,"
Leviticus,26,4,"I will give you rain at the right time, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will bear their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Your threshing will continue until grape harvest, and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time; you will have plenty of food to eat and live securely in your land."
Leviticus,26,6,"I will give peace to the land, and you will lie down with nothing to frighten you. I will remove dangerous animals from the land, and no sword will pass through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you will pursue 100, and 100 of you will pursue 10,000; your enemies will fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"“I will turn to you, make you fruitful and multiply you, and confirm My covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,You will eat the old grain of the previous year and will clear out the old to make room for the new.
Leviticus,26,11,"I will place My residence among you, and I will not reject you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, so that you would no longer be their slaves. I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to live in freedom."
Leviticus,26,14,“But if you do not obey Me and observe all these commands—
Leviticus,26,15,"if you reject My statutes and despise My ordinances, and do not observe all My commands—and break My covenant,"
Leviticus,26,16,then I will do this to you: I will bring terror on you—wasting disease and fever that will cause your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away. You will sow your seed in vain because your enemies will eat it.
Leviticus,26,17,"I will turn against you, so that you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even though no one is pursuing you."
Leviticus,26,18,"“But if after these things you will not obey Me, I will proceed to discipline you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,"I will break down your strong pride. I will make your sky like iron and your land like bronze,"
Leviticus,26,20,"and your strength will be used up for nothing. Your land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"“If you act with hostility toward Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will multiply your plagues seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will send wild animals against you that will deprive you of your children, ravage your livestock, and reduce your numbers until your roads are deserted."
Leviticus,26,23,"“If in spite of these things you do not accept My discipline, but act with hostility toward Me,"
Leviticus,26,24,then I will act with hostility toward you; I also will strike you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus,26,25,"I will bring a sword against you to execute the vengeance of the covenant. Though you withdraw into your cities, I will send a pestilence among you, and you will be delivered into enemy hands."
Leviticus,26,26,"When I cut off your supply of bread, 10 women will bake your bread in a single oven and ration out your bread by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"“And if in spite of this you do not obey Me but act with hostility toward Me,"
Leviticus,26,28,I will act with furious hostility toward you; I will also discipline you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus,26,29,You will eat the flesh of your sons; you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
Leviticus,26,30,"I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and heap your dead bodies on the lifeless bodies of your idols; I will reject you."
Leviticus,26,31,I will reduce your cities to ruins and devastate your sanctuaries. I will not smell the pleasing aroma of your sacrifices.
Leviticus,26,32,"I also will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to live there will be appalled by it."
Leviticus,26,33,"But I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw a sword to chase after you. So your land will become desolate, and your cities will become ruins."
Leviticus,26,34,"“Then the land will make up for its Sabbath years during the time it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time the land will rest and make up for its Sabbaths."
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as it lies desolate, it will have the rest it did not have during your Sabbaths when you lived there."
Leviticus,26,36,"“I will put anxiety in the hearts of those of you who survive in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a wind-driven leaf will put them to flight, and they will flee as one flees from a sword, and fall though no one is pursuing them."
Leviticus,26,37,They will stumble over one another as if fleeing from a sword though no one is pursuing them. You will not be able to stand against your enemies.
Leviticus,26,38,You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you.
Leviticus,26,39,Those who survive in the lands of your enemies will waste away because of their sin; they will also waste away because of their fathers’ sins along with theirs.
Leviticus,26,40,"“But if they will confess their sin and the sin of their fathers—their unfaithfulness that they practiced against Me, and how they acted with hostility toward Me,"
Leviticus,26,41,"and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies—and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled, and if they will pay the penalty for their sin,"
Leviticus,26,42,"then I will remember My covenant with Jacob. I will also remember My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"For the land abandoned by them will make up for its Sabbaths by lying desolate without the people, while they pay the penalty for their sin, because they rejected My ordinances and abhorred My statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet in spite of this, while they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject or abhor them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them, since I am Yahweh their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"For their sake I will remember the covenant with their fathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God; I am Yahweh.”"
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws the LORD established between Himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai."
Leviticus,27,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When someone makes a special vow to the LORD that involves the assessment of people,"
Leviticus,27,3,"if the assessment concerns a male from 20 to 60 years old, your assessment is 50 silver shekels measured by the standard sanctuary shekel."
Leviticus,27,4,"If the person is a female, your assessment is 30 shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,"If the person is from five to 20 years old, your assessment for a male is 20 shekels and for a female 10 shekels."
Leviticus,27,6,"If the person is from one month to five years old, your assessment for a male is five silver shekels, and for a female your assessment is three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"If the person is 60 years or more, your assessment is 15 shekels for a male and 10 shekels for a female."
Leviticus,27,8,"But if one is too poor to pay the assessment, he must present the person before the priest and the priest will set a value for him. The priest will set a value for him according to what the one making the vow can afford."
Leviticus,27,9,"“If the vow involves one of the animals that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any of these he gives to the LORD will be holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He may not replace it or make a substitution for it, either good for bad, or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"“If the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest."
Leviticus,27,12,"The priest will set its value, whether high or low; the price will be set as the priest makes the assessment for you."
Leviticus,27,13,"If the one who brought it decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value."
Leviticus,27,14,"“When a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, the priest will assess its value, whether high or low. The price will stand just as the priest assesses it."
Leviticus,27,15,"But if the one who consecrated his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it will be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"“If a man consecrates to the LORD any part of a field that he possesses, your assessment of value will be proportional to the seed needed to sow it, at the rate of 50 silver shekels for every five bushels of barley seed."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your assessment."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the price for him in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee, so that your assessment will be reduced."
Leviticus,27,19,"If the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and the field will transfer back to him."
Leviticus,27,20,"But if he does not redeem the field or if he has sold it to another man, it is no longer redeemable."
Leviticus,27,21,"When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will be holy to the LORD like a field permanently set apart; it becomes the priest’s property."
Leviticus,27,22,"“If a person consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased that is not part of his inherited landholding,"
Leviticus,27,23,"then the priest will calculate for him the amount of the assessment up to the Year of Jubilee, and the person will pay the assessed value on that day as a holy offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the Year of Jubilee the field will return to the one he bought it from, the original owner."
Leviticus,27,25,"All your assessed values will be measured by the standard sanctuary shekel, 20 gerahs to the shekel."
Leviticus,27,26,"“But no one can consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, whether an animal from the herd or flock, to the LORD, because a firstborn already belongs to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,27,"If it is one of the unclean livestock, it must be ransomed according to your assessment by adding a fifth of its value to it. If it is not redeemed, it can be sold according to your assessment."
Leviticus,27,28,"“Nothing that a man permanently sets apart to the LORD from all he owns, whether a person, an animal, or his inherited landholding, can be sold or redeemed; everything set apart is especially holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,29,No person who has been set apart for destruction is to be ransomed; he must be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,"“Every tenth of the land’s produce, grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,31,"If a man decides to redeem any part of this tenth, he must add a fifth to its value."
Leviticus,27,32,"Every tenth animal from the herd or flock, which passes under the shepherd’s rod, will be holy to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,33,"He is not to inspect whether it is good or bad, and he is not to make a substitution for it. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute will be holy; they cannot be redeemed.”"
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commands the LORD gave Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,1,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Wilderness of Sinai, on the first day of the second month of the second year after Israel’s departure from the land of Egypt:"
Numbers,1,2,"“Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of every male one by one."
Numbers,1,3,You and Aaron are to register those who are 20 years old or more by their military divisions—everyone who can serve in Israel’s army.
Numbers,1,4,"A man from each tribe is to be with you, each one the head of his ancestral house."
Numbers,1,5,These are the names of the men who are to assist you: Elizur son of Shedeur from Reuben;
Numbers,1,6,Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai from Simeon;
Numbers,1,7,Nahshon son of Amminadab from Judah;
Numbers,1,8,Nethanel son of Zuar from Issachar;
Numbers,1,9,Eliab son of Helon from Zebulun;
Numbers,1,10,"from the sons of Joseph: Elishama son of Ammihud from Ephraim, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur from Manasseh;"
Numbers,1,11,Abidan son of Gideoni from Benjamin;
Numbers,1,12,Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai from Dan;
Numbers,1,13,Pagiel son of Ochran from Asher;
Numbers,1,14,Eliasaph son of Deuel from Gad;
Numbers,1,15,Ahira son of Enan from Naphtali.
Numbers,1,16,"These are the men called from the community; they are leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of Israel’s clans.”"
Numbers,1,17,"So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,"
Numbers,1,18,"and they assembled the whole community on the first day of the second month. They recorded their ancestry by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting one by one the names of those 20 years old or more,"
Numbers,1,19,just as the LORD commanded Moses. He registered them in the Wilderness of Sinai:
Numbers,1,20,"The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting one by one the names of every male 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,21,"those registered for the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500."
Numbers,1,22,"The descendants of Simeon: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, those registered counting one by one the names of every male 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,23,"those registered for the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300."
Numbers,1,24,"The descendants of Gad: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,25,"those registered for the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650."
Numbers,1,26,"The descendants of Judah: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,27,"those registered for the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600."
Numbers,1,28,"The descendants of Issachar: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,29,"those registered for the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400."
Numbers,1,30,"The descendants of Zebulun: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,31,"those registered for the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400."
Numbers,1,32,"The descendants of Joseph: The descendants of Ephraim: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,33,"those registered for the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500."
Numbers,1,34,"The descendants of Manasseh: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,35,"those registered for the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200."
Numbers,1,36,"The descendants of Benjamin: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,37,"those registered for the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400."
Numbers,1,38,"The descendants of Dan: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,39,"those registered for the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700."
Numbers,1,40,"The descendants of Asher: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,41,"those registered for the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500."
Numbers,1,42,"The descendants of Naphtali: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,"
Numbers,1,43,"those registered for the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400."
Numbers,1,44,"These are the men Moses and Aaron registered, with the assistance of the 12 leaders of Israel; each represented his ancestral house."
Numbers,1,45,"So all the Israelites 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in Israel’s army, were registered by their ancestral houses."
Numbers,1,46,"All those registered numbered 603,550."
Numbers,1,47,But the Levites were not registered with them by their ancestral tribe.
Numbers,1,48,For the LORD had told Moses:
Numbers,1,49,“Do not register or take a census of the tribe of Levi with the other Israelites.
Numbers,1,50,"Appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, all its furnishings, and everything in it. They are to transport the tabernacle and all its articles, take care of it, and camp around it."
Numbers,1,51,"Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever it is to stop at a campsite, the Levites are to set it up. Any unauthorized person who comes near it must be put to death."
Numbers,1,52,"“The Israelites are to camp by their military divisions, each man with his encampment and under his banner."
Numbers,1,53,"The Levites are to camp around the tabernacle of the testimony and watch over it, so that no wrath will fall on the Israelite community.”"
Numbers,1,54,The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers,2,1,The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,2,2,“The Israelites are to camp under their respective banners beside the flags of their ancestral houses. They are to camp around the tent of meeting at a distance from it:
Numbers,2,3,Judah’s military divisions will camp on the east side toward the sunrise under their banner. The leader of the descendants of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
Numbers,2,4,"His military division numbers 74,600."
Numbers,2,5,The tribe of Issachar will camp next to it. The leader of the Issacharites is Nethanel son of Zuar.
Numbers,2,6,"His military division numbers 54,400."
Numbers,2,7,The tribe of Zebulun will be next. The leader of the Zebulunites is Eliab son of Helon.
Numbers,2,8,"His military division numbers 57,400."
Numbers,2,9,"The total number in their military divisions who belong to Judah’s encampment is 186,400; they will move out first."
Numbers,2,10,Reuben’s military divisions will camp on the south side under their banner. The leader of the Reubenites is Elizur son of Shedeur.
Numbers,2,11,"His military division numbers 46,500."
Numbers,2,12,The tribe of Simeon will camp next to it. The leader of the Simeonites is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers,2,13,"His military division numbers 59,300."
Numbers,2,14,The tribe of Gad will be next. The leader of the Gadites is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
Numbers,2,15,"His military division numbers 45,650."
Numbers,2,16,"The total number in their military divisions who belong to Reuben’s encampment is 151,450; they will move out second."
Numbers,2,17,"The tent of meeting is to move out with the Levites’ camp, which is in the middle of the camps. They are to move out just as they camp, each in his place, with their banners."
Numbers,2,18,Ephraim’s military divisions will camp on the west side under their banner. The leader of the Ephraimites is Elishama son of Ammihud.
Numbers,2,19,"His military division numbers 40,500."
Numbers,2,20,The tribe of Manasseh will be next to it. The leader of the Manassites is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
Numbers,2,21,"His military division numbers 32,200."
Numbers,2,22,The tribe of Benjamin will be next. The leader of the Benjaminites is Abidan son of Gideoni.
Numbers,2,23,"His military division numbers 35,400."
Numbers,2,24,"The total in their military divisions who belong to Ephraim’s encampment number 108,100; they will move out third."
Numbers,2,25,Dan’s military divisions will camp on the north side under their banner. The leader of the Danites is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers,2,26,"His military division numbers 62,700."
Numbers,2,27,The tribe of Asher will camp next to it. The leader of the Asherites is Pagiel son of Ochran.
Numbers,2,28,"His military division numbers 41,500."
Numbers,2,29,The tribe of Naphtali will be next. The leader of the Naphtalites is Ahira son of Enan.
Numbers,2,30,"His military division numbers 53,400."
Numbers,2,31,"The total number who belong to Dan’s encampment is 157,600; they are to move out last, with their banners.”"
Numbers,2,32,"These are the Israelites registered by their ancestral houses. The total number in the camps by their military divisions is 603,550."
Numbers,2,33,"But the Levites were not registered among the Israelites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,2,34,"The Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; they camped by their banners in this way and moved out the same way, each man by his clan and by his ancestral house."
Numbers,3,1,These are the family records of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"These are the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab, the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"These are the names of Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests."
Numbers,3,4,"But Nadab and Abihu died in the LORD’s presence when they presented unauthorized fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai, and they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests under the direction of Aaron their father."
Numbers,3,5,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,3,6,“Bring the tribe of Levi near and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
Numbers,3,7,They are to perform duties for him and the entire community before the tent of meeting by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,8,They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting and perform duties for the Israelites by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,9,Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they have been assigned exclusively to him from the Israelites.
Numbers,3,10,"You are to appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out their priestly responsibilities, but any unauthorized person who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.”"
Numbers,3,11,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,3,12,"“See, I have taken the Levites from the Israelites in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb. The Levites belong to Me,"
Numbers,3,13,"because every firstborn belongs to Me. At the time I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated every firstborn in Israel to Myself, both man and animal. They are Mine; I am Yahweh.”"
Numbers,3,14,The LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:
Numbers,3,15,“Register the Levites by their ancestral houses and their clans. You are to register every male one month old or more.”
Numbers,3,16,So Moses registered them in obedience to the LORD as he had been commanded:
Numbers,3,17,"These were Levi’s sons by name: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Numbers,3,18,These were the names of Gershon’s sons by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
Numbers,3,19,"Kohath’s sons by their clans were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel."
Numbers,3,20,Merari’s sons by their clans were Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans by their ancestral houses.
Numbers,3,21,The Libnite clan and the Shimeite clan came from Gershon; these were the Gershonite clans.
Numbers,3,22,"Those registered, counting every male one month old or more, numbered 7,500."
Numbers,3,23,"The Gershonite clans camped behind the tabernacle on the west side,"
Numbers,3,24,and the leader of the Gershonite family was Eliasaph son of Lael.
Numbers,3,25,"The Gershonites’ duties at the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle, the tent, its covering, the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,3,26,"the hangings of the courtyard, the screen for the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, and the tent ropes—all the work relating to these."
Numbers,3,27,"The Amramite clan, the Izharite clan, the Hebronite clan, and the Uzzielite clan came from Kohath; these were the Kohathites."
Numbers,3,28,"Counting every male one month old or more, there were 8,600 responsible for the duties of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,29,"The clans of the Kohathites camped on the south side of the tabernacle,"
Numbers,3,30,and the leader of the family of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
Numbers,3,31,"Their duties involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the sanctuary utensils that were used with these, and the screen—and all the work relating to them."
Numbers,3,32,The chief of the Levite leaders was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; he had oversight of those responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
Numbers,3,33,The Mahlite clan and the Mushite clan came from Merari; these were the Merarite clans.
Numbers,3,34,"Those registered, counting every male one month old or more, numbered 6,200."
Numbers,3,35,The leader of the family of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they camped on the north side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,36,"The assigned duties of Merari’s descendants involved the tabernacle’s supports, crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and all the work related to these,"
Numbers,3,37,"in addition to the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes."
Numbers,3,38,"Moses, Aaron, and his sons, who performed the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites, camped in front of the tabernacle on the east, in front of the tent of meeting toward the sunrise. Any unauthorized person who came near it was to be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"The total number of all the Levite males one month old or more that Moses and Aaron registered by their clans at the LORD’s command was 22,000."
Numbers,3,40,"The LORD told Moses: “Register every firstborn male of the Israelites one month old or more, and list their names."
Numbers,3,41,"You are to take the Levites for Me—I am Yahweh—in place of every firstborn among the Israelites, and the Levites’ cattle in place of every firstborn among the Israelites’ cattle.”"
Numbers,3,42,"So Moses registered every firstborn among the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him."
Numbers,3,43,"The total number of the firstborn males one month old or more listed by name was 22,273."
Numbers,3,44,The LORD spoke to Moses again:
Numbers,3,45,"“Take the Levites in place of every firstborn among the Israelites, and the Levites’ cattle in place of their cattle. The Levites belong to Me; I am Yahweh."
Numbers,3,46,"As the redemption price for the 273 firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites,"
Numbers,3,47,"collect five shekels for each person, according to the standard sanctuary shekel—20 gerahs to the shekel."
Numbers,3,48,Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for those who are in excess among the Israelites.”
Numbers,3,49,So Moses collected the redemption money from those in excess of the ones redeemed by the Levites.
Numbers,3,50,"He collected the money from the firstborn Israelites: 1,365 shekels measured by the standard sanctuary shekel."
Numbers,3,51,"He gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the LORD, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,4,1,The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,4,2,"“Among the Levites, take a census of the Kohathites by their clans and their ancestral houses,"
Numbers,4,3,men from 30 years old to 50 years old—everyone who is qualified to do work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,4,4,“The service of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting concerns the most holy objects.
Numbers,4,5,"Whenever the camp is about to move on, Aaron and his sons are to go in, take down the screening veil, and cover the ark of the testimony with it."
Numbers,4,6,"They are to place over this a covering made of manatee skin, spread a solid blue cloth on top, and insert its poles."
Numbers,4,7,"“They are to spread a blue cloth over the table of the Presence and place the plates and cups on it, as well as the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering. The regular bread offering is to be on it."
Numbers,4,8,"They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover them with a covering made of manatee skin, and insert the poles in the table."
Numbers,4,9,"“They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand used for light, with its lamps, snuffers, and firepans, as well as its jars of oil by which they service it."
Numbers,4,10,Then they must place it with all its utensils inside a covering made of manatee skin and put them on the carrying frame.
Numbers,4,11,"“They are to spread a blue cloth over the gold altar, cover it with a covering made of manatee skin, and insert its poles."
Numbers,4,12,"They are to take all the serving utensils they use in the sanctuary, place them in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering made of manatee skin, and put them on a carrying frame."
Numbers,4,13,"“They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar, spread a purple cloth over it,"
Numbers,4,14,"and place all the equipment on it that they use in serving: the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and basins—all the equipment of the altar. They are to spread a covering made of manatee skin over it and insert its poles."
Numbers,4,15,"“Aaron and his sons are to finish covering the holy objects and all their equipment whenever the camp is to move on. The Kohathites will come and carry them, but they are not to touch the holy objects or they will die. These are the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,16,"“Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has oversight of the lamp oil, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. He has oversight of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, the holy objects and their utensils.”"
Numbers,4,17,Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,4,18,“Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be wiped out from the Levites.
Numbers,4,19,Do this for them so that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons are to go in and assign each man his task and transportation duty.
Numbers,4,20,"The Kohathites are not to go in and look at the holy objects, even for a moment, or they will die.”"
Numbers,4,21,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,4,22,"“Take a census of the Gershonites also, by their ancestral houses and their clans."
Numbers,4,23,"Register men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who is qualified to perform service, to do work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,24,This is the service of the Gershonite clans regarding work and transportation duties:
Numbers,4,25,"They are to transport the tabernacle curtains, the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering made of manatee skin on top of it, the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,4,26,"the hangings of the courtyard, the screen for the entrance at the gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, along with their ropes and all the equipment for their service. They will carry out everything that needs to be done with these items."
Numbers,4,27,"“All the service of the Gershonites, all their transportation duties and all their other work, is to be done at the command of Aaron and his sons; you are to assign to them all that they are responsible to carry."
Numbers,4,28,"This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting, and their duties will be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,4,29,"“As for the Merarites, you are to register them by their clans and their ancestral houses."
Numbers,4,30,"Register men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who is qualified to do the work of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,31,"This is what they are responsible to carry as the whole of their service at the tent of meeting: the supports of the tabernacle, with its crossbars, posts, and bases,"
Numbers,4,32,"the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes, including all their equipment and all the work related to them. You are to assign by name the items that they are responsible to carry."
Numbers,4,33,"This is the service of the Merarite clans regarding all their work at the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.”"
Numbers,4,34,"So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the community registered the Kohathites by their clans and their ancestral houses,"
Numbers,4,35,"men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified for work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,36,"The men registered by their clans numbered 2,750."
Numbers,4,37,"These were the registered men of the Kohathite clans, everyone who could serve at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron registered them at the LORD’s command through Moses."
Numbers,4,38,"The Gershonites were registered by their clans and their ancestral houses,"
Numbers,4,39,"men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified for work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,40,"The men registered by their clans and their ancestral houses numbered 2,630."
Numbers,4,41,These were the registered men of the Gershonite clans. At the LORD’s command Moses and Aaron registered everyone who could serve at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,4,42,"The men of the Merarite clans were registered by their clans and their ancestral houses,"
Numbers,4,43,"those from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified for work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,44,"The men registered by their clans numbered 3,200."
Numbers,4,45,These were the registered men of the Merarite clans; Moses and Aaron registered them at the LORD’s command through Moses.
Numbers,4,46,"Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel registered all the Levites by their clans and their ancestral houses,"
Numbers,4,47,"from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified to do the work of serving at the tent of meeting and transporting it."
Numbers,4,48,"Their registered men numbered 8,580."
Numbers,4,49,"At the LORD’s command they were registered under the direction of Moses, each one according to his work and transportation duty, and his assignment was as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,The LORD instructed Moses:
Numbers,5,2,"“Command the Israelites to send away anyone from the camp who is afflicted with a skin disease, anyone who has a bodily discharge, or anyone who is defiled because of a corpse."
Numbers,5,3,"You must send away both male or female; send them outside the camp, so that they will not defile their camps where I dwell among them.”"
Numbers,5,4,"The Israelites did this, sending them outside the camp. The Israelites did as the LORD instructed Moses."
Numbers,5,5,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,5,6,"“Tell the Israelites: When a man or woman commits any sin against another, that person acts unfaithfully toward the LORD and is guilty."
Numbers,5,7,"The person is to confess the sin he has committed. He is to pay full compensation, add a fifth of its value to it, and give it to the individual he has wronged."
Numbers,5,8,"But if that individual has no relative to receive compensation, the compensation goes to the LORD for the priest, along with the atonement ram by which the priest will make atonement for the guilty person."
Numbers,5,9,Every holy contribution the Israelites present to the priest will be his.
Numbers,5,10,Each one’s holy contribution is his to give; what each one gives to the priest will be his.”
Numbers,5,11,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,5,12,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: If any man’s wife goes astray, is unfaithful to him,"
Numbers,5,13,"and sleeps with another, but it is concealed from her husband, and she is undetected, even though she has defiled herself, since there is no witness against her, and she wasn’t caught in the act;"
Numbers,5,14,and if a feeling of jealousy comes over the husband and he becomes jealous because of his wife who has defiled herself—or if a feeling of jealousy comes over him and he becomes jealous of her though she has not defiled herself—
Numbers,5,15,"then the man is to bring his wife to the priest. He is also to bring an offering for her of two quarts of barley flour. He is not to pour oil over it or put frankincense on it because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering for remembrance that brings sin to mind."
Numbers,5,16,“The priest is to bring her forward and have her stand before the LORD.
Numbers,5,17,"Then the priest is to take holy water in a clay bowl, and take some of the dust from the tabernacle floor and put it in the water."
Numbers,5,18,"After the priest has the woman stand before the LORD, he is to let down her hair and place in her hands the grain offering for remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. The priest is to hold the bitter water that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,19,"The priest will require the woman to take an oath and will say to her, ‘If no man has slept with you, if you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband’s authority, be unaffected by this bitter water that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,20,"But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has slept with you’—"
Numbers,5,21,"at this point the priest must make the woman take the oath with the sworn curse, and he is to say to her—‘May the LORD make you into an object of your people’s cursing and swearing when He makes your thigh shrivel and your belly swell."
Numbers,5,22,"May this water that brings a curse enter your stomach, causing your belly to swell and your thigh to shrivel.’ “And the woman must reply, ‘Amen, Amen.’"
Numbers,5,23,“Then the priest is to write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.
Numbers,5,24,"He will require the woman to drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and it will enter her and cause bitter suffering."
Numbers,5,25,"The priest is to take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, wave the offering before the LORD, and bring it to the altar."
Numbers,5,26,The priest is to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Then he will require the woman to drink the water.
Numbers,5,27,"“When he makes her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering; her belly will swell, and her thigh will shrivel. She will become a curse among her people."
Numbers,5,28,"But if the woman has not defiled herself and is pure, she will be unaffected and will be able to conceive children."
Numbers,5,29,"“This is the law regarding jealousy when a wife goes astray and defiles herself while under her husband’s authority,"
Numbers,5,30,"or when a feeling of jealousy comes over a husband and he becomes jealous of his wife. He is to have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest will apply this entire ritual to her."
Numbers,5,31,"The husband will be free of guilt, but that woman will bear the consequences of her guilt.”"
Numbers,6,1,The LORD instructed Moses:
Numbers,6,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When a man or woman makes a special vow, a Nazirite vow, to consecrate himself to the LORD,"
Numbers,6,3,he is to abstain from wine and beer. He must not drink vinegar made from wine or from beer. He must not drink any grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins.
Numbers,6,4,"He is not to eat anything produced by the grapevine, from seeds to skin, during his vow."
Numbers,6,5,“You must not cut his hair throughout the time of his vow of consecration. He must be holy until the time is completed during which he consecrates himself to the LORD; he is to let the hair of his head grow long.
Numbers,6,6,He must not go near a dead body during the time he consecrates himself to the LORD.
Numbers,6,7,"He is not to defile himself for his father or mother, or his brother or sister, when they die, because the hair consecrated to his God is on his head."
Numbers,6,8,He is holy to the LORD during the time of consecration.
Numbers,6,9,"“If someone suddenly dies near him, defiling his consecrated head of hair, he must shave his head on the day of his purification; he is to shave it on the seventh day."
Numbers,6,10,On the eighth day he is to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,6,11,"The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement on behalf of the Nazirite, since he sinned because of the corpse. On that day he must consecrate his head again."
Numbers,6,12,"He is to rededicate his time of consecration to the LORD and to bring a year-old male lamb as a restitution offering. But do not count the previous period, because his consecrated hair became defiled."
Numbers,6,13,"“This is the law of the Nazirite: On the day his time of consecration is completed, he must be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Numbers,6,14,"He is to present an offering to the LORD of one unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, one unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, one unblemished ram as a fellowship offering,"
Numbers,6,15,"along with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of unleavened cakes made from fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers coated with oil."
Numbers,6,16,“The priest is to present these before the LORD and sacrifice the Nazirite’s sin offering and burnt offering.
Numbers,6,17,"He will also offer the ram as a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened bread. Then the priest will offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,"“The Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head at the entrance to the tent of meeting, take the hair from his head, and put it on the fire under the fellowship sacrifice."
Numbers,6,19,"The priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated head."
Numbers,6,20,"The priest is to wave them as a presentation offering before the LORD. It is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine."
Numbers,6,21,"“This is the ritual of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD for his consecration, in addition to whatever else he can afford; he must fulfill whatever vow he makes in keeping with the ritual for his consecration.”"
Numbers,6,22,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,6,23,“Tell Aaron and his sons how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:
Numbers,6,24,May Yahweh bless you and protect you;
Numbers,6,25,may Yahweh make His face shine on you and be gracious to you;
Numbers,6,26,may Yahweh look with favor on you and give you peace.
Numbers,6,27,"In this way they will pronounce My name over the Israelites, and I will bless them.”"
Numbers,7,1,"On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils. After he anointed and consecrated these things,"
Numbers,7,2,"the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses, presented an offering. They were the tribal leaders who supervised the registration."
Numbers,7,3,"They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and 12 oxen, a cart from every two leaders and an ox from each one, and presented them in front of the tabernacle."
Numbers,7,4,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these from them to be used in the work of the tent of meeting, and give this offering to the Levites, to each division according to their service.”"
Numbers,7,6,So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Numbers,7,7,"He gave the Gershonites two carts and four oxen corresponding to their service,"
Numbers,7,8,"and gave the Merarites four carts and eight oxen corresponding to their service, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,7,9,"But he did not give any to the Kohathites, since their responsibility was service related to the holy objects carried on their shoulders."
Numbers,7,10,The leaders also presented the dedication gift for the altar when it was anointed. The leaders presented their offerings in front of the altar.
Numbers,7,11,"The LORD told Moses, “Each day have one leader present his offering for the dedication of the altar.”"
Numbers,7,12,The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah.

Numbers,7,89,"When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim. He spoke to him that way."
Numbers,8,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,8,2,"“Speak to Aaron and tell him: When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps are to give light in front of the lampstand.”"
Numbers,8,3,So Aaron did this; he set up its lamps to give light in front of the lampstand just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers,8,4,"This is the way the lampstand was made: it was a hammered work of gold, hammered from its base to its flower petals. The lampstand was made according to the pattern the LORD had shown Moses."
Numbers,8,5,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,8,6,“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and ceremonially cleanse them.
Numbers,8,7,"This is what you must do to them for their purification: Sprinkle them with the purification water. Have them shave their entire bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves."
Numbers,8,8,"“They are to take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering."
Numbers,8,9,Bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the entire Israelite community.
Numbers,8,10,"Then present the Levites before the LORD, and have the Israelites lay their hands on them."
Numbers,8,11,"Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a presentation offering from the Israelites, so that they may perform the LORD’s work."
Numbers,8,12,"Next the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls. Sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,"“You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and you are to present them before the LORD as a presentation offering."
Numbers,8,14,In this way you are to separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites so that the Levites will belong to Me.
Numbers,8,15,"After that the Levites may come to serve at the tent of meeting, once you have ceremonially cleansed them and presented them as a presentation offering."
Numbers,8,16,"For they have been exclusively assigned to Me from the Israelites. I have taken them for Myself in place of all who come first from the womb, every Israelite firstborn."
Numbers,8,17,"For every firstborn among the Israelites is Mine, both man and animal. I consecrated them to Myself on the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt."
Numbers,8,18,But I have taken the Levites in place of every firstborn among the Israelites.
Numbers,8,19,"From the Israelites, I have given the Levites exclusively to Aaron and his sons to perform the work for the Israelites at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.”"
Numbers,8,20,"Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community did this to the Levites. The Israelites did everything to them the LORD commanded Moses regarding the Levites."
Numbers,8,21,The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them before the LORD as a presentation offering. Aaron also made atonement for them to ceremonially cleanse them.
Numbers,8,22,"After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. So they did to them as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites."
Numbers,8,23,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,8,24,"“In regard to the Levites: From 25 years old or more, a man enters the service in the work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,8,25,But at 50 years old he is to retire from his service in the work and no longer serve.
Numbers,8,26,"He may assist his brothers to fulfill responsibilities at the tent of meeting, but he must not do the work. This is how you are to deal with the Levites regarding their duties.”"
Numbers,9,1,"In the first month of the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt, the LORD told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:"
Numbers,9,2,“The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time.
Numbers,9,3,You must observe it at its appointed time on the fourteenth day of this month at twilight; you are to observe it according to all its statutes and ordinances.”
Numbers,9,4,"So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover,"
Numbers,9,5,and they observed it in the first month on the fourteenth day at twilight in the Wilderness of Sinai. The Israelites did everything as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers,9,6,"But there were some men who were unclean because of a human corpse, so they could not observe the Passover on that day. These men came before Moses and Aaron the same day"
Numbers,9,7,"and said to him, “We are unclean because of a human corpse. Why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD’s offering at its appointed time with the other Israelites?”"
Numbers,9,8,"Moses replied to them, “Wait here until I hear what the LORD commands for you.”"
Numbers,9,9,Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,9,10,"“Tell the Israelites: When any one of you or your descendants is unclean because of a corpse or is on a distant journey, he may still observe the Passover to the LORD."
Numbers,9,11,"Such people are to observe it in the second month, on the fourteenth day at twilight. They are to eat the animal with unleavened bread and bitter herbs;"
Numbers,9,12,they may not leave any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes.
Numbers,9,13,"“But the man who is ceremonially clean, is not on a journey, and yet fails to observe the Passover is to be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD’s offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin."
Numbers,9,14,"“If a foreigner resides with you and wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same statute to both the foreign resident and the native of the land.”"
Numbers,9,15,"On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and it appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning."
Numbers,9,16,"It remained that way continuously: the cloud would cover it, appearing like fire at night."
Numbers,9,17,"Whenever the cloud was lifted up above the tent, the Israelites would set out; at the place where the cloud stopped, there the Israelites camped."
Numbers,9,18,"At the LORD’s command the Israelites set out, and at the LORD’s command they camped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they camped."
Numbers,9,19,"Even when the cloud stayed over the tabernacle many days, the Israelites carried out the LORD’s requirement and did not set out."
Numbers,9,20,Sometimes the cloud remained over the tabernacle for only a few days. They would camp at the LORD’s command and set out at the LORD’s command.
Numbers,9,21,"Sometimes the cloud remained only from evening until morning; when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out. Or if it remained a day and a night, they moved out when the cloud lifted."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it was two days, a month, or longer, the Israelites camped and did not set out as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle. But when it was lifted, they set out."
Numbers,9,23,"They camped at the LORD’s command, and they set out at the LORD’s command. They carried out the LORD’s requirement according to His command through Moses."
Numbers,10,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,10,2,“Make two trumpets of hammered silver to summon the community and have the camps set out.
Numbers,10,3,"When both are sounded in long blasts, the entire community is to gather before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"However, if one is sounded, only the leaders, the heads of Israel’s clans, are to gather before you."
Numbers,10,5,"“When you sound short blasts, the camps pitched on the east are to set out."
Numbers,10,6,"When you sound short blasts a second time, the camps pitched on the south are to set out. Short blasts are to be sounded for them to set out."
Numbers,10,7,"When calling the assembly together, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones."
Numbers,10,8,"The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. Your use of these is a permanent statute throughout your generations."
Numbers,10,9,"“When you enter into battle in your land against an adversary who is attacking you, sound short blasts on the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God and be delivered from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"You are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your fellowship sacrifices and on your joyous occasions, your appointed festivals, and the beginning of each of your months. They will serve as a reminder for you before your God: I am Yahweh your God.”"
Numbers,10,11,"During the second year, in the second month on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was lifted up above the tabernacle of the testimony."
Numbers,10,12,"The Israelites traveled on from the Wilderness of Sinai, moving from one place to the next until the cloud stopped in the Wilderness of Paran."
Numbers,10,13,They set out for the first time according to the LORD’s command through Moses.
Numbers,10,14,"The military divisions of the camp of Judah with their banner set out first, and Nahshon son of Amminadab was over Judah’s divisions."
Numbers,10,15,"Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the Issachar tribe,"
Numbers,10,16,and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the Zebulun tribe.
Numbers,10,17,"The tabernacle was then taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting the tabernacle."
Numbers,10,18,"The military divisions of the camp of Reuben with their banner set out, and Elizur son of Shedeur was over Reuben’s division."
Numbers,10,19,"Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of Simeon’s tribe,"
Numbers,10,20,and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
Numbers,10,21,"The Kohathites then set out, transporting the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival."
Numbers,10,22,"Next the military divisions of the camp of Ephraim with their banner set out, and Elishama son of Ammihud was over Ephraim’s division."
Numbers,10,23,"Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,"
Numbers,10,24,and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
Numbers,10,25,"The military divisions of the camp of Dan with their banner set out, serving as rear guard for all the camps, and Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was over Dan’s division."
Numbers,10,26,"Pagiel son of Ochran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,"
Numbers,10,27,and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
Numbers,10,28,This was the order of march for the Israelites by their military divisions as they set out.
Numbers,10,29,"Moses said to Hobab, son of Moses’ father-in-law Reuel the Midianite: “We’re setting out for the place the LORD promised: ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"But he replied to him, “I don’t want to go. Instead, I will go to my own land and my relatives.”"
Numbers,10,31,"“Please don’t leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes."
Numbers,10,32,"If you come with us, whatever good the LORD does for us we will do for you.”"
Numbers,10,33,They set out from the mountain of the LORD on a three-day journey with the ark of the LORD’s covenant traveling ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting place for them.
Numbers,10,34,"Meanwhile, the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp."
Numbers,10,35,"Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say: Arise, LORD! Let Your enemies be scattered, and those who hate You flee from Your presence."
Numbers,10,36,"When it came to rest, he would say: Return, LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel."
Numbers,11,1,"Now the people began complaining openly before the LORD about hardship. When the LORD heard, His anger burned, and fire from the LORD blazed among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"Then the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down."
Numbers,11,3,"So that place was named Taberah, because the LORD’s fire had blazed among them."
Numbers,11,4,"Contemptible people among them had a strong craving for other food. The Israelites cried again and said, “Who will feed us meat?"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the free fish we ate in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic."
Numbers,11,6,But now our appetite is gone; there’s nothing to look at but this manna!”
Numbers,11,7,"The manna resembled coriander seed, and its appearance was like that of bdellium."
Numbers,11,8,"The people walked around and gathered it. They ground it on a pair of grinding stones or crushed it in a mortar, then boiled it in a cooking pot and shaped it into cakes. It tasted like a pastry cooked with the finest oil."
Numbers,11,9,"When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it."
Numbers,11,10,"Moses heard the people, family after family, crying at the entrance of their tents. The LORD was very angry; Moses was also provoked."
Numbers,11,11,"So Moses asked the LORD, “Why have You brought such trouble on Your servant? Why are You angry with me, and why do You burden me with all these people?"
Numbers,11,12,"Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth so You should tell me, ‘Carry them at your breast, as a nursing woman carries a baby,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers?"
Numbers,11,13,Where can I get meat to give all these people? For they are crying to me: ‘Give us meat to eat!’
Numbers,11,14,I can’t carry all these people by myself. They are too much for me.
Numbers,11,15,"If You are going to treat me like this, please kill me right now. If You are pleased with me, don’t let me see my misery anymore.”"
Numbers,11,16,"The LORD answered Moses, “Bring Me 70 men from Israel known to you as elders and officers of the people. Take them to the tent of meeting and have them stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"Then I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the Spirit who is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself."
Numbers,11,18,"“Tell the people: Purify yourselves in readiness for tomorrow, and you will eat meat because you cried before the LORD: ‘Who will feed us meat? We really had it good in Egypt.’ The LORD will give you meat and you will eat."
Numbers,11,19,"You will eat, not for one day, or two days, or five days, or 10 days, or 20 days,"
Numbers,11,20,"but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes nauseating to you—because you have rejected the LORD who is among you, and cried to Him: ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”"
Numbers,11,21,"But Moses replied, “I’m in the middle of a people with 600,000 foot soldiers, yet You say, ‘I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.’"
Numbers,11,22,"If flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?”"
Numbers,11,23,"The LORD answered Moses, “Is the LORD’s power limited? You will see whether or not what I have promised will happen to you.”"
Numbers,11,24,Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. He brought 70 men from the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.
Numbers,11,25,"Then the LORD descended in the cloud and spoke to him. He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed the Spirit on the 70 elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they never did it again."
Numbers,11,26,"Two men had remained in the camp, one named Eldad and the other Medad; the Spirit rested on them—they were among those listed, but had not gone out to the tent—and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"Joshua son of Nun, assistant to Moses since his youth, responded, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”"
Numbers,11,29,"But Moses asked him, “Are you jealous on my account? If only all the LORD’s people were prophets and the LORD would place His Spirit on them!”"
Numbers,11,30,Then Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.
Numbers,11,31,"A wind sent by the LORD came up and blew quail in from the sea; it dropped them at the camp all around, three feet off the ground, about a day’s journey in every direction."
Numbers,11,32,The people were up all that day and night and all the next day gathering the quail—the one who took the least gathered 50 bushels—and they spread them out all around the camp.
Numbers,11,33,"While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the LORD’s anger burned against the people, and the LORD struck them with a very severe plague."
Numbers,11,34,"So they named that place Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved the meat."
Numbers,11,35,From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth and remained there.
Numbers,12,1,Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he married (for he had married a Cushite woman).
Numbers,12,2,"They said, “Does the LORD speak only through Moses? Does He not also speak through us?” And the LORD heard it."
Numbers,12,3,"Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth."
Numbers,12,4,"Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three come out to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went out."
Numbers,12,5,"Then the LORD descended in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them came forward,"
Numbers,12,6,"He said: “Listen to what I say: If there is a prophet among you from the LORD, I make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,Not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My household.
Numbers,12,8,"I speak with him directly, openly, and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. So why were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?”"
Numbers,12,9,"The LORD’s anger burned against them, and He left."
Numbers,12,10,"As the cloud moved away from the tent, Miriam’s skin suddenly became diseased, as white as snow. When Aaron turned toward her, he saw that she was diseased"
Numbers,12,11,"and said to Moses, “My lord, please don’t hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed."
Numbers,12,12,Please don’t let her be like a dead baby whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
Numbers,12,13,"Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “God, please heal her!”"
Numbers,12,14,"The LORD answered Moses, “If her father had merely spit in her face, wouldn’t she remain in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.”"
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was brought back in."
Numbers,12,16,"After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,The LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,13,2,“Send men to scout out the land of Canaan I am giving to the Israelites. Send one man who is a leader among them from each of their ancestral tribes.”
Numbers,13,3,Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran at the LORD’s command. All the men were leaders in Israel.
Numbers,13,4,These were their names: Shammua son of Zaccur from the tribe of Reuben;
Numbers,13,5,Shaphat son of Hori from the tribe of Simeon;
Numbers,13,6,Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;
Numbers,13,7,Igal son of Joseph from the tribe of Issachar;
Numbers,13,8,Hoshea son of Nun from the tribe of Ephraim;
Numbers,13,9,Palti son of Raphu from the tribe of Benjamin;
Numbers,13,10,Gaddiel son of Sodi from the tribe of Zebulun;
Numbers,13,11,Gaddi son of Susi from the tribe of Manasseh (from the tribe of Joseph);
Numbers,13,12,Ammiel son of Gemalli from the tribe of Dan;
Numbers,13,13,Sethur son of Michael from the tribe of Asher;
Numbers,13,14,Nahbi son of Vophsi from the tribe of Naphtali;
Numbers,13,15,Geuel son of Machi from the tribe of Gad.
Numbers,13,16,"These were the names of the men Moses sent to scout out the land, and Moses renamed Hoshea son of Nun, Joshua."
Numbers,13,17,"When Moses sent them to scout out the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up this way to the Negev, then go up into the hill country."
Numbers,13,18,"See what the land is like, and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many."
Numbers,13,19,Is the land they live in good or bad? Are the cities they live in encampments or fortifications?
Numbers,13,20,Is the land fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous. Bring back some fruit from the land.” It was the season for the first ripe grapes.
Numbers,13,21,So they went up and scouted out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob near the entrance to Hamath.
Numbers,13,22,"They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were living. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt."
Numbers,13,23,"When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which was carried on a pole by two men. They also took some pomegranates and figs."
Numbers,13,24,That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there.
Numbers,13,25,At the end of 40 days they returned from scouting out the land.
Numbers,13,26,"The men went back to Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back a report for them and the whole community, and they showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"They reported to Moses: “We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed it is flowing with milk and honey, and here is some of its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,"However, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified. We also saw the descendants of Anak there."
Numbers,13,29,"The Amalekites are living in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Then Caleb quieted the people in the presence of Moses and said, “We must go up and take possession of the land because we can certainly conquer it!”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who had gone up with him responded, “We can’t go up against the people because they are stronger than we are!”"
Numbers,13,32,"So they gave a negative report to the Israelites about the land they had scouted: “The land we passed through to explore is one that devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw in it are men of great size."
Numbers,13,33,"We even saw the Nephilim there—the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim! To ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and we must have seemed the same to them.”"
Numbers,14,1,"Then the whole community broke into loud cries, and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"All the Israelites complained about Moses and Aaron, and the whole community told them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to die by the sword? Our wives and little children will become plunder. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?”
Numbers,14,4,"So they said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and go back to Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell down with their faces to the ground in front of the whole assembly of the Israelite community.
Numbers,14,6,"Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who scouted out the land, tore their clothes"
Numbers,14,7,and said to the entire Israelite community: “The land we passed through and explored is an extremely good land.
Numbers,14,8,"If the LORD is pleased with us, He will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and give it to us."
Numbers,14,9,"Only don’t rebel against the LORD, and don’t be afraid of the people of the land, for we will devour them. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us. Don’t be afraid of them!”"
Numbers,14,10,"While the whole community threatened to stone them, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,14,11,"The LORD said to Moses, “How long will these people despise Me? How long will they not trust in Me despite all the signs I have performed among them?"
Numbers,14,12,I will strike them with a plague and destroy them. Then I will make you into a greater and mightier nation than they are.”
Numbers,14,13,"But Moses replied to the LORD, “The Egyptians will hear about it, for by Your strength You brought up this people from them."
Numbers,14,14,"They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, are among these people, how You, LORD, are seen face to face, how Your cloud stands over them, and how You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"If You kill this people with a single blow, the nations that have heard of Your fame will declare,"
Numbers,14,16,"‘Since the LORD wasn’t able to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’"
Numbers,14,17,"“So now, may my Lord’s power be magnified just as You have spoken:"
Numbers,14,18,"The LORD is slow to anger and rich in faithful love, forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion. But He will not leave the guilty unpunished, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ wrongdoing on the children to the third and fourth generation."
Numbers,14,19,"Please pardon the wrongdoing of this people, in keeping with the greatness of Your faithful love, just as You have forgiven them from Egypt until now.”"
Numbers,14,20,"The LORD responded, “I have pardoned them as you requested."
Numbers,14,21,"Yet as surely as I live and as the whole earth is filled with the LORD’s glory,"
Numbers,14,22,"none of the men who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tested Me these 10 times and did not obey Me,"
Numbers,14,23,will ever see the land I swore to give their fathers. None of those who have despised Me will see it.
Numbers,14,24,"But since My servant Caleb has a different spirit and has followed Me completely, I will bring him into the land where he has gone, and his descendants will inherit it."
Numbers,14,25,"Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the lowlands, turn back tomorrow and head for the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.”"
Numbers,14,26,Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
Numbers,14,27,“How long must I endure this evil community that keeps complaining about Me? I have heard the Israelites’ complaints that they make against Me.
Numbers,14,28,"Tell them: As surely as I live,” this is the LORD’s declaration, “I will do to you exactly as I heard you say."
Numbers,14,29,"Your corpses will fall in this wilderness—all of you who were registered in the census, the entire number of you 20 years old or more—because you have complained about Me."
Numbers,14,30,"I swear that none of you will enter the land I promised to settle you in, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun."
Numbers,14,31,"I will bring your children whom you said would become plunder into the land you rejected, and they will enjoy it."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for 40 years and bear the penalty for your acts of unfaithfulness until all your corpses lie scattered in the wilderness.
Numbers,14,34,"You will bear the consequences of your sins 40 years based on the number of the 40 days that you scouted the land, a year for each day. You will know My displeasure."
Numbers,14,35,"I, Yahweh, have spoken. I swear that I will do this to the entire evil community that has conspired against Me. They will come to an end in the wilderness, and there they will die.”"
Numbers,14,36,"So the men Moses sent to scout out the land, and who returned and incited the entire community to complain about him by spreading a negative report about the land—"
Numbers,14,37,those men who spread the negative report about the land were struck down by the LORD.
Numbers,14,38,Only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to scout out the land.
Numbers,14,39,"When Moses reported these words to all the Israelites, the people were overcome with grief."
Numbers,14,40,"They got up early the next morning and went up the ridge of the hill country, saying, “Let’s go to the place the LORD promised, for we were wrong.”"
Numbers,14,41,"But Moses responded, “Why are you going against the LORD’s command? It won’t succeed."
Numbers,14,42,"Don’t go, because the LORD is not among you and you will be defeated by your enemies."
Numbers,14,43,"The Amalekites and Canaanites are right in front of you, and you will fall by the sword. The LORD won’t be with you, since you have turned from following Him.”"
Numbers,14,44,"But they dared to go up the ridge of the hill country, even though the ark of the LORD’s covenant and Moses did not leave the camp."
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that part of the hill country came down, attacked them, and routed them as far as Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,The LORD instructed Moses:
Numbers,15,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you to settle in,"
Numbers,15,3,"and you make a fire offering to the LORD from the herd or flock—either a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow, or as a freewill offering, or at your appointed festivals—to produce a pleasing aroma for the LORD,"
Numbers,15,4,the one presenting his offering to the LORD must also present a grain offering of two quarts of fine flour mixed with a quart of oil.
Numbers,15,5,Prepare a quart of wine as a drink offering with the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb.
Numbers,15,6,"“If you prepare a grain offering with a ram, it must be four quarts of fine flour mixed with a third of a gallon of oil."
Numbers,15,7,Also present a third of a gallon of wine for a drink offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers,15,8,"“If you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow, or as a fellowship offering to the LORD,"
Numbers,15,9,a grain offering of six quarts of fine flour mixed with two quarts of oil must be presented with the bull.
Numbers,15,10,Also present two quarts of wine as a drink offering. It is a fire offering of pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers,15,11,"This is to be done for each ox, ram, lamb, or goat."
Numbers,15,12,"This is how you must prepare each of them, no matter how many."
Numbers,15,13,“Every Israelite is to prepare these things in this way when he presents a fire offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers,15,14,"When a foreigner resides with you or someone else is among you and wants to prepare a fire offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he is to do exactly as you do throughout your generations."
Numbers,15,15,The assembly is to have the same statute for both you and the foreign resident as a permanent statute throughout your generations. You and the foreigner will be alike before the LORD.
Numbers,15,16,The same law and the same ordinance will apply to both you and the foreigner who resides with you.”
Numbers,15,17,The LORD instructed Moses:
Numbers,15,18,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: After you enter the land where I am bringing you,"
Numbers,15,19,you are to offer a contribution to the LORD when you eat from the food of the land.
Numbers,15,20,You are to offer a loaf from your first batch of dough as a contribution; offer it just like a contribution from the threshing floor.
Numbers,15,21,"Throughout your generations, you are to give the LORD a contribution from the first batch of your dough."
Numbers,15,22,“When you sin unintentionally and do not obey all these commands that the LORD spoke to Moses—
Numbers,15,23,"all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day the LORD issued the commands and onward throughout your generations—"
Numbers,15,24,"and if it was done unintentionally without the community’s awareness, the entire community is to prepare one young bull for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation, and one male goat as a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"The priest must then make atonement for the entire Israelite community so that they may be forgiven, for the sin was unintentional. They are to bring their offering, one made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD for their unintentional sin."
Numbers,15,26,"The entire Israelite community and the foreigner who resides among them will be forgiven, since it happened to all the people unintentionally."
Numbers,15,27,"“If one person sins unintentionally, he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering."
Numbers,15,28,"The priest must then make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the person who acts in error sinning unintentionally, and when he makes atonement for him, he will be forgiven."
Numbers,15,29,"You are to have the same law for the person who acts in error, whether he is an Israelite or a foreigner who lives among you."
Numbers,15,30,"“But the person who acts defiantly, whether native or foreign resident, blasphemes the LORD. That person is to be cut off from his people."
Numbers,15,31,"He will certainly be cut off, because he has despised the LORD’s word and broken His command; his guilt remains on him.”"
Numbers,15,32,"While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,"Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the entire community."
Numbers,15,34,They placed him in custody because it had not been decided what should be done to him.
Numbers,15,35,"Then the LORD told Moses, “The man is to be put to death. The entire community is to stone him outside the camp.”"
Numbers,15,36,"So the entire community brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,15,37,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,15,38,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that throughout their generations they are to make tassels for the corners of their garments, and put a blue cord on the tassel at each corner."
Numbers,15,39,"These will serve as tassels for you to look at, so that you may remember all the LORD’s commands and obey them and not become unfaithful by following your own heart and your own eyes."
Numbers,15,40,This way you will remember and obey all My commands and be holy to your God.
Numbers,15,41,I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Yahweh your God.”
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took"
Numbers,16,2,"250 prominent Israelite men who were leaders of the community and representatives in the assembly, and they rebelled against Moses."
Numbers,16,3,"They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, “You have gone too far! Everyone in the entire community is holy, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the LORD’s assembly?”"
Numbers,16,4,"When Moses heard this, he fell facedown."
Numbers,16,5,"Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him, who is set apart, and the one He will let come near Him. He will let the one He chooses come near Him."
Numbers,16,6,"Korah, you and all your followers are to do this: take firepans, and tomorrow"
Numbers,16,7,place fire in them and put incense on them before the LORD. Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is set apart. It is you Levites who have gone too far!”
Numbers,16,8,"Moses also told Korah, “Now listen, Levites!"
Numbers,16,9,"Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the Israelite community to bring you near to Himself, to perform the work at the LORD’s tabernacle, and to stand before the community to minister to them?"
Numbers,16,10,"He has brought you near, and all your fellow Levites who are with you, but you are seeking the priesthood as well."
Numbers,16,11,"Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should complain about him?”"
Numbers,16,12,"Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!"
Numbers,16,13,Is it not enough that you brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Do you also have to appoint yourself as ruler over us?
Numbers,16,14,"Furthermore, you didn’t bring us to a land flowing with milk and honey or give us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!”"
Numbers,16,15,"Then Moses became angry and said to the LORD, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"So Moses told Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you, they, and Aaron."
Numbers,16,17,"Each of you is to take his firepan, place incense on it, and present his firepan before the LORD—250 firepans. You and Aaron are each to present your firepan also.”"
Numbers,16,18,"Each man took his firepan, placed fire in it, put incense on it, and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting along with Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,16,19,"After Korah assembled the whole community against them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole community."
Numbers,16,20,"The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,16,21,“Separate yourselves from this community so I may consume them instantly.”
Numbers,16,22,"But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and said, “God, God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You vent Your wrath on the whole community?”"
Numbers,16,23,"The LORD replied to Moses,"
Numbers,16,24,"“Tell the community: Get away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”"
Numbers,16,25,"Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him."
Numbers,16,26,"He warned the community, “Get away now from the tents of these wicked men. Don’t touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”"
Numbers,16,27,"So they got away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents with their wives, children, and infants."
Numbers,16,28,"Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the LORD sent me to do all these things and that it was not of my own will:"
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die naturally as all people would, and suffer the fate of all, then the LORD has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if the LORD brings about something unprecedented, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them along with all that belongs to them so that they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have despised the LORD.”"
Numbers,16,31,"Just as he finished speaking all these words, the ground beneath them split open."
Numbers,16,32,"The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, all Korah’s people, and all their possessions."
Numbers,16,33,"They went down alive into Sheol with all that belonged to them. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly."
Numbers,16,34,"At their cries, all the people of Israel who were around them fled because they thought, “The earth may swallow us too!”"
Numbers,16,35,Fire also came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were presenting the incense.
Numbers,16,36,Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
Numbers,16,37,"“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the firepans from the burning debris, because they are holy, and scatter the fire far away."
Numbers,16,38,"As for the firepans of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives, make them into hammered sheets as plating for the altar, for they presented them before the LORD, and the firepans are holy. They will be a sign to the Israelites.”"
Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar the priest took the bronze firepans that those who were burned had presented, and they were hammered into plating for the altar,"
Numbers,16,40,just as the LORD commanded him through Moses. It was to be a reminder for the Israelites that no unauthorized person outside the lineage of Aaron should approach to offer incense before the LORD and become like Korah and his followers.
Numbers,16,41,"The next day the entire Israelite community complained about Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the LORD’s people!”"
Numbers,16,42,"When the community assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the LORD’s glory appeared."
Numbers,16,43,"Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,"
Numbers,16,44,"and the LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,16,45,“Get away from this community so that I may consume them instantly.” But they fell facedown.
Numbers,16,46,"Then Moses told Aaron, “Take your firepan, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the community and make atonement for them, because wrath has come from the LORD; the plague has begun.”"
Numbers,16,47,"So Aaron took his firepan as Moses had ordered, ran into the middle of the assembly, and saw that the plague had begun among the people. After he added incense, he made atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,"He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was halted."
Numbers,16,49,"But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who died because of the Korah incident."
Numbers,16,50,"Aaron then returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, since the plague had been halted."
Numbers,17,1,The LORD instructed Moses:
Numbers,17,2,"“Speak to the Israelites and take one staff from them for each ancestral house, 12 staffs from all the leaders of their ancestral houses. Write each man’s name on his staff."
Numbers,17,3,"Write Aaron’s name on Levi’s staff, because there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral house."
Numbers,17,4,Then place them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony where I meet with you.
Numbers,17,5,"The staff of the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the Israelites’ complaints that they have been making about you.”"
Numbers,17,6,"So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff, one for each of the leaders of their ancestral houses, 12 staffs in all. Aaron’s staff was among them."
Numbers,17,7,Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers,17,8,"The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, formed buds, blossomed, and produced almonds!"
Numbers,17,9,"Moses then brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff."
Numbers,17,10,"The LORD told Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the testimony to be kept as a sign for the rebels, so that you may put an end to their complaints before Me, or else they will die.”"
Numbers,17,11,So Moses did as the LORD commanded him.
Numbers,17,12,"Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we’re perishing! We’re lost; we’re all lost!"
Numbers,17,13,Anyone who comes near the LORD’s tabernacle will die. Will we all perish?”
Numbers,18,1,"The LORD said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and your ancestral house will be responsible for sin against the sanctuary. You and your sons will be responsible for sin involving your priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,"But also bring your relatives with you from the tribe of Levi, your ancestral tribe, so they may join you and assist you and your sons in front of the tent of the testimony."
Numbers,18,3,"They are to perform duties for you and for the whole tent. They must not come near the sanctuary equipment or the altar; otherwise, both they and you will die."
Numbers,18,4,"They are to join you and guard the tent of meeting, doing all the work at the tent, but no unauthorized person may come near you."
Numbers,18,5,“You are to guard the sanctuary and the altar so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again.
Numbers,18,6,"Look, I have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift for you, assigned by the LORD to work at the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,7,"But you and your sons will carry out your priestly responsibilities for everything concerning the altar and for what is inside the veil, and you will do that work. I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift, but an unauthorized person who comes near the sanctuary will be put to death.”"
Numbers,18,8,"Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, “Look, I have put you in charge of the contributions brought to Me. As for all the holy offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons as a portion and a permanent statute."
Numbers,18,9,"A portion of the holiest offerings kept from the fire will be yours; every one of their offerings that they give Me, whether the grain offering, sin offering, or restitution offering will be most holy for you and your sons."
Numbers,18,10,You are to eat it as a most holy offering. Every male may eat it; it is to be holy to you.
Numbers,18,11,“The contribution of their gifts also belongs to you. I have given all the Israelites’ presentation offerings to you and to your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your house may eat it.
Numbers,18,12,"I am giving you all the best of the fresh olive oil, new wine, and grain, which the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits."
Numbers,18,13,"The firstfruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, belong to you. Every clean person in your house may eat them."
Numbers,18,14,“Everything in Israel that is permanently dedicated to the LORD belongs to you.
Numbers,18,15,"The firstborn of every living thing, man or animal, presented to the LORD belongs to you. But you must certainly redeem the firstborn of man, and redeem the firstborn of an unclean animal."
Numbers,18,16,"You will pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your assessment: five shekels of silver by the standard sanctuary shekel, which is 20 gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"“However, you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as a fire offering for a pleasing aroma to the LORD."
Numbers,18,18,But their meat belongs to you. It belongs to you like the breast of the presentation offering and the right thigh.
Numbers,18,19,“I give to you and to your sons and daughters all the holy contributions that the Israelites present to the LORD as a permanent statute. It is a permanent covenant of salt before the LORD for you as well as your offspring.”
Numbers,18,20,"The LORD told Aaron, “You will not have an inheritance in their land; there will be no portion among them for you. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites."
Numbers,18,21,"“Look, I have given the Levites every tenth in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they do, the work of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,22,"The Israelites must never again come near the tent of meeting, or they will incur guilt and die."
Numbers,18,23,"The Levites will do the work of the tent of meeting, and they will bear the consequences of their sin. The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites; this is a permanent statute throughout your generations."
Numbers,18,24,For I have given them the tenth that the Israelites present to the LORD as a contribution for their inheritance. That is why I told them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.”
Numbers,18,25,"The LORD instructed Moses,"
Numbers,18,26,"“Speak to the Levites and tell them: When you receive from the Israelites the tenth that I have given you as your inheritance, you must present part of it as an offering to the LORD—a tenth of the tenth."
Numbers,18,27,Your offering will be credited to you as if it were your grain from the threshing floor or the full harvest from the winepress.
Numbers,18,28,You are to present an offering to the LORD from every tenth you receive from the Israelites. Give some of it to Aaron the priest as an offering to the LORD.
Numbers,18,29,You must present the entire offering due the LORD from all your gifts. The best part of the tenth is to be consecrated.
Numbers,18,30,"“Tell them further: Once you have presented the best part of the tenth, and it is credited to you Levites as the produce of the threshing floor or the winepress,"
Numbers,18,31,then you and your household may eat it anywhere. It is your wage in return for your work at the tent of meeting.
Numbers,18,32,"You will not incur guilt because of it once you have presented the best part of it, but you must not defile the Israelites’ holy offerings, so that you will not die.”"
Numbers,19,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron,"
Numbers,19,2,“This is the legal statute that the LORD has commanded: Instruct the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red cow that has no defect and has never been yoked.
Numbers,19,3,"Give it to Eleazar the priest, and he will have it brought outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence."
Numbers,19,4,Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers,19,5,"The cow must be burned in his sight. Its hide, flesh, and blood, are to be burned along with its dung."
Numbers,19,6,"The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson yarn, and throw them onto the fire where the cow is burning."
Numbers,19,7,"Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may enter the camp, but he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,8,"The one who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he will remain unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,9,“A man who is clean is to gather up the cow’s ashes and deposit them outside the camp in a ceremonially clean place. The ashes must be kept by the Israelite community for preparing the water to remove impurity; it is a sin offering.
Numbers,19,10,"Then the one who gathers up the cow’s ashes must wash his clothes, and he will remain unclean until evening. This is a permanent statute for the Israelites and for the foreigner who resides among them."
Numbers,19,11,“The person who touches any human corpse will be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"He is to purify himself with the water on the third day and the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Anyone who touches a body of a person who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person will be cut off from Israel. He remains unclean because the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him, and his uncleanness is still on him."
Numbers,19,14,"“This is the law when a person dies in a tent: everyone who enters the tent and everyone who is already in the tent will be unclean for seven days,"
Numbers,19,15,and any open container without a lid tied on it is unclean.
Numbers,19,16,"Anyone in the open field who touches a person who has been killed by the sword or has died, or who even touches a human bone, or a grave, will be unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"For the purification of the unclean person, they are to take some of the ashes of the burnt sin offering, put them in a jar, and add fresh water to them."
Numbers,19,18,"A person who is clean is to take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there. He is also to sprinkle the one who touched a bone, a grave, a corpse, or a person who had been killed."
Numbers,19,19,"“The one who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and the seventh day. After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day, the one being purified must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be clean by evening."
Numbers,19,20,"But a person who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person will be cut off from the assembly because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"This is a permanent statute for them. The person who sprinkles the water for impurity is to wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water for impurity will be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,22,"Anything the unclean person touches will become unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening.”"
Numbers,20,1,"The entire Israelite community entered the Wilderness of Zin in the first month, and they settled in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,"There was no water for the community, so they assembled against Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,20,3,"The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD."
Numbers,20,4,Why have you brought the LORD’s assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?
Numbers,20,5,"Why have you led us up from Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It’s not a place of grain, figs, vines, and pomegranates, and there is no water to drink!”"
Numbers,20,6,"Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting. They fell down with their faces to the ground, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them."
Numbers,20,7,"The LORD spoke to Moses,"
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the staff and assemble the community. You and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock while they watch, and it will yield its water. You will bring out water for them from the rock and provide drink for the community and their livestock.”"
Numbers,20,9,So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence just as He had commanded him.
Numbers,20,10,"Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels! Must we bring water out of this rock for you?”"
Numbers,20,11,"Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank."
Numbers,20,12,"But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land I have given them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"These are the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD, and He showed His holiness to them."
Numbers,20,14,"Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, “This is what your brother Israel says, ‘You know all the hardships that have overtaken us."
Numbers,20,15,"Our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt many years, but the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly."
Numbers,20,16,"When we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the border of your territory."
Numbers,20,17,"Please let us travel through your land. We won’t travel through any field or vineyard, or drink any well water. We will travel the King’s Highway; we won’t turn to the right or the left until we have traveled through your territory.’”"
Numbers,20,18,"But Edom answered him, “You must not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword.”"
Numbers,20,19,"“We will go on the main road,” the Israelites replied to them, “and if we or our herds drink your water, we will pay its price. There will be no problem; only let us travel through on foot.”"
Numbers,20,20,"Yet Edom insisted, “You must not travel through.” And they came out to confront them with a large force of heavily-armed people."
Numbers,20,21,"Edom refused to allow Israel to travel through their territory, and Israel turned away from them."
Numbers,20,22,"After they set out from Kadesh, the entire Israelite community came to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom,"
Numbers,20,24,"“Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land I have given the Israelites, because you both rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.
Numbers,20,26,Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people and die there.”
Numbers,20,27,"So Moses did as the LORD commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community."
Numbers,20,28,"After Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain."
Numbers,20,29,"When the whole community saw that Aaron had passed away, the entire house of Israel mourned for him 30 days."
Numbers,21,1,"When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming on the Atharim road, he fought against Israel and captured some prisoners."
Numbers,21,2,"Then Israel made a vow to the LORD, “If You will deliver this people into our hands, we will completely destroy their cities.”"
Numbers,21,3,"The LORD listened to Israel’s request, the Canaanites were defeated, and Israel completely destroyed them and their cities. So they named the place Hormah."
Numbers,21,4,"Then they set out from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to bypass the land of Edom, but the people became impatient because of the journey."
Numbers,21,5,"The people spoke against God and Moses: “Why have you led us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!”"
Numbers,21,6,"Then the LORD sent poisonous snakes among the people, and they bit them so that many Israelites died."
Numbers,21,7,"The people then came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Intercede with the LORD so that He will take the snakes away from us.” And Moses interceded for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a snake image and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will recover.”"
Numbers,21,9,"So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. Whenever someone was bitten, and he looked at the bronze snake, he recovered."
Numbers,21,10,The Israelites set out and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness that borders Moab on the east.
Numbers,21,12,From there they went and camped at Zered Valley.
Numbers,21,13,"They set out from there and camped on the other side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness that extends from the Amorite border, because the Arnon was the Moabite border between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"Therefore it is stated in the Book of the LORD’s Wars: Waheb in Suphah and the ravines of the Arnon,"
Numbers,21,15,even the slopes of the ravines that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.
Numbers,21,16,"From there they went to Beer, the well the LORD told Moses about, “Gather the people so I may give them water.”"
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, well—sing to it!"
Numbers,21,18,"The princes dug the well; the nobles of the people hollowed it out with a scepter and with their staffs. They went from the wilderness to Mattanah,"
Numbers,21,19,"from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
Numbers,21,20,from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of Moab near the Pisgah highlands that overlook the wasteland.
Numbers,21,21,Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:
Numbers,21,22,“Let us travel through your land. We won’t go into the fields or vineyards. We won’t drink any well water. We will travel the King’s Highway until we have traveled through your territory.”
Numbers,21,23,"But Sihon would not let Israel travel through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel."
Numbers,21,24,"Israel struck him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only up to the Ammonite border, because it was fortified."
Numbers,21,25,"Israel took all the cities and lived in all these Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all its villages."
Numbers,21,26,"Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken control of all his land as far as the Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Therefore the poets say: Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; let the city of Sihon be restored."
Numbers,21,28,"For fire came out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of Arnon’s heights."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to you, Moab! You have been destroyed, people of Chemosh! He gave up his sons as refugees, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon the Amorite king."
Numbers,21,30,"We threw them down; Heshbon has been destroyed as far as Dibon. We caused desolation as far as Nophah, which reaches as far as Medeba."
Numbers,21,31,So Israel lived in the Amorites’ land.
Numbers,21,32,"After Moses sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,21,33,"Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out against them with his whole army to do battle at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you along with his whole army and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So they struck him, his sons, and his whole army until no one was left, and they took possession of his land."
Numbers,22,1,The Israelites traveled on and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan across from Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,"Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous, and Moab dreaded the Israelites."
Numbers,22,4,"So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us like an ox eats up the green plants in the field.” Since Balak son of Zippor was Moab’s king at that time,"
Numbers,22,5,"he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people. Balak said to him: “Look, a people has come out of Egypt; they cover the surface of the land and are living right across from me."
Numbers,22,6,"Please come and put a curse on these people for me because they are more powerful than I am. I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that those you bless are blessed and those you curse are cursed.”"
Numbers,22,7,The elders of Moab and Midian departed with fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and reported Balak’s words to him.
Numbers,22,8,"He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will give you the answer the LORD tells me.” So the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"Balaam replied to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent this message to me:"
Numbers,22,11,"‘Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.’”"
Numbers,22,12,"Then God said to Balaam, “You are not to go with them. You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.”"
Numbers,22,13,"So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your land, because the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"The officials of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and reported, “Balaam refused to come with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,Balak sent officials again who were more numerous and higher in rank than the others.
Numbers,22,16,"They came to Balaam and said to him, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Let nothing keep you from coming to me,"
Numbers,22,17,for I will greatly honor you and do whatever you ask me. So please come and put a curse on these people for me!’”
Numbers,22,18,"But Balaam responded to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the command of the LORD my God to do anything small or great."
Numbers,22,19,"Please stay here overnight as the others did, so that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me.”"
Numbers,22,20,"God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you.”"
Numbers,22,21,"When he got up in the morning, Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the officials of Moab."
Numbers,22,22,"But God was incensed that Balaam was going, and the Angel of the LORD took His stand on the path to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing on the path with a drawn sword in His hand, she turned off the path and went into the field. So Balaam hit her to return her to the path."
Numbers,22,24,"Then the Angel of the LORD stood in a narrow passage between the vineyards, with a stone wall on either side."
Numbers,22,25,"The donkey saw the Angel of the LORD and pressed herself against the wall, squeezing Balaam’s foot against it. So he hit her once again."
Numbers,22,26,The Angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or the left.
Numbers,22,27,"When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she crouched down under Balaam. So he became furious and beat the donkey with his stick."
Numbers,22,28,"Then the LORD opened the donkey’s mouth, and she asked Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Balaam answered the donkey, “You made me look like a fool. If I had a sword in my hand, I’d kill you now!”"
Numbers,22,30,"But the donkey said, “Am I not the donkey you’ve ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” “No,” he replied."
Numbers,22,31,"Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the path with a drawn sword in His hand. Balaam knelt and bowed with his face to the ground."
Numbers,22,32,"The Angel of the LORD asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Look, I came out to oppose you, because what you are doing is evil in My sight."
Numbers,22,33,"The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, I would have killed you by now and let her live.”"
Numbers,22,34,"Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD, “I have sinned, for I did not know that You were standing in the path to confront me. And now, if it is evil in Your sight, I will go back.”"
Numbers,22,35,"Then the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you are to say only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials."
Numbers,22,36,"When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border at the edge of his territory."
Numbers,22,37,"Balak asked Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?”"
Numbers,22,38,"Balaam said to him, “Look, I have come to you, but can I say anything I want? I must speak only the message God puts in my mouth.”"
Numbers,22,39,"So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth."
Numbers,22,40,"Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent for Balaam and the officials who were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"In the morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him to Bamoth-baal. From there he saw the outskirts of the people’s camp."
Numbers,23,1,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”"
Numbers,23,2,"So Balak did as Balaam directed, and they offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone. Maybe the LORD will meet with me. I will tell you whatever He reveals to me.” So he went to a barren hill."
Numbers,23,4,"God met with him and Balaam said to Him, “I have arranged seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.”"
Numbers,23,5,"Then the LORD put a message in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak and say what I tell you.”"
Numbers,23,6,"So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with all the officials of Moab."
Numbers,23,7,"Balaam proclaimed his poem: Balak brought me from Aram; the king of Moab, from the eastern mountains: “Come, put a curse on Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel!”"
Numbers,23,8,How can I curse someone God has not cursed? How can I denounce someone the LORD has not denounced?
Numbers,23,9,"I see them from the top of rocky cliffs, and I watch them from the hills. There is a people living alone; it does not consider itself among the nations."
Numbers,23,10,Who has counted the dust of Jacob or numbered the dust clouds of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright; let the end of my life be like theirs.
Numbers,23,11,"“What have you done to me?” Balak asked Balaam. “I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you have only blessed them!”"
Numbers,23,12,"He answered, “Shouldn’t I say exactly what the LORD puts in my mouth?”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place where you can see them. You will only see the outskirts of their camp; you won’t see all of them. From there, put a curse on them for me.”"
Numbers,23,14,"So Balak took him to Lookout Field on top of Pisgah, built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here by your burnt offering while I seek the LORD over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth. Then He said, “Return to Balak and say what I tell you.”"
Numbers,23,17,"So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked him, “What did the LORD say?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Balaam proclaimed his poem: Balak, get up and listen; son of Zippor, pay attention to what I say!"
Numbers,23,19,"God is not a man who lies, or a son of man who changes His mind. Does He speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?"
Numbers,23,20,"I have indeed received a command to bless; since He has blessed, I cannot change it."
Numbers,23,21,"He considers no disaster for Jacob; He sees no trouble for Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and there is rejoicing over the King among them."
Numbers,23,22,God brought them out of Egypt; He is like the horns of a wild ox for them.
Numbers,23,23,"There is no magic curse against Jacob and no divination against Israel. It will now be said about Jacob and Israel, “What great things God has done!”"
Numbers,23,24,A people rise up like a lioness; They rouse themselves like a lion. They will not lie down until they devour the prey and drink the blood of the slain.
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak told Balaam, “Don’t curse them and don’t bless them!”"
Numbers,23,26,"But Balaam answered him, “Didn’t I tell you: Whatever the LORD says, I must do?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Again Balak said to Balaam, “Please come. I will take you to another place. Maybe it will be agreeable to God that you can put a curse on them for me there.”"
Numbers,23,28,"So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland."
Numbers,23,29,"Balaam told Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”"
Numbers,23,30,So Balak did as Balaam said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,24,1,"Since Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go to seek omens as on previous occasions, but turned toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,"When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him,"
Numbers,24,3,"and he proclaimed his poem: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened,"
Numbers,24,4,"the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls into a trance with his eyes uncovered:"
Numbers,24,5,"How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwellings, Israel."
Numbers,24,6,"They stretch out like river valleys, like gardens beside a stream, like aloes the LORD has planted, like cedars beside the water."
Numbers,24,7,"Water will flow from his buckets, and his seed will be by abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted."
Numbers,24,8,God brought him out of Egypt; He is like the horns of a wild ox for them. He will feed on enemy nations and gnaw their bones; he will strike them with his arrows.
Numbers,24,9,"He crouches, he lies down like a lion or a lioness—who dares to rouse him? Those who bless you will be blessed, and those who curse you will be cursed."
Numbers,24,10,"Then Balak became furious with Balaam, struck his hands together, and said to him, “I summoned you to put a curse on my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them these three times."
Numbers,24,11,"Now go to your home! I said I would reward you richly, but look, the LORD has denied you a reward.”"
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I previously tell the messengers you sent me:"
Numbers,24,13,"If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the LORD’s command, to do anything good or bad of my own will? I will say whatever the LORD says."
Numbers,24,14,"Now I am going back to my people, but first, let me warn you what these people will do to your people in the future.”"
Numbers,24,15,"Then he proclaimed his poem: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened;"
Numbers,24,16,"the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God and has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls into a trance with his eyes uncovered:"
Numbers,24,17,"I see him, but not now; I perceive him, but not near. A star will come from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel. He will smash the forehead of Moab and strike down all the Shethites."
Numbers,24,18,"Edom will become a possession; Seir will become a possession of its enemies, but Israel will be triumphant."
Numbers,24,19,One who comes from Jacob will rule; he will destroy the city’s survivors.
Numbers,24,20,"Then Balaam saw Amalek and proclaimed his poem: Amalek was first among the nations, but his future is destruction."
Numbers,24,21,Next he saw the Kenites and proclaimed his poem: Your dwelling place is enduring; your nest is set in the cliffs.
Numbers,24,22,Kain will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.
Numbers,24,23,"Once more he proclaimed his poem: Ah, who can live when God does this?"
Numbers,24,24,"Ships will come from the coast of Kittim; they will afflict Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to destruction."
Numbers,24,25,"Balaam then arose and went back to his homeland, and Balak also went his way."
Numbers,25,1,"While Israel was staying in the Acacia Grove, the people began to have sexual relations with the women of Moab."
Numbers,25,2,"The women invited them to the sacrifices for their gods, and the people ate and bowed in worship to their gods."
Numbers,25,3,"So Israel aligned itself with Baal of Peor, and the LORD’s anger burned against Israel."
Numbers,25,4,"The LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD so that His burning anger may turn away from Israel.”"
Numbers,25,5,"So Moses told Israel’s judges, “Kill each of the men who aligned themselves with Baal of Peor.”"
Numbers,25,6,An Israelite man came bringing a Midianite woman to his relatives in the sight of Moses and the whole Israelite community while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Numbers,25,7,"When Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw this, he got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand,"
Numbers,25,8,"followed the Israelite man into the tent, and drove it through both the Israelite man and the woman—through her belly. Then the plague on the Israelites was stopped,"
Numbers,25,9,"but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000."
Numbers,25,10,"The LORD spoke to Moses,"
Numbers,25,11,"“Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the Israelites because he was zealous among them with My zeal, so that I did not destroy the Israelites in My zeal."
Numbers,25,12,Therefore declare: I grant him My covenant of peace.
Numbers,25,13,"It will be a covenant of perpetual priesthood for him and his future descendants, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”"
Numbers,25,14,"The name of the slain Israelite man, who was struck dead with the Midianite woman, was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite ancestral house."
Numbers,25,15,"The name of the slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a tribal head of an ancestral house in Midian."
Numbers,25,16,The LORD told Moses:
Numbers,25,17,“Attack the Midianites and strike them dead.
Numbers,25,18,"For they attacked you with the treachery that they used against you in the Peor incident. They did the same in the case involving their sister Cozbi, daughter of the Midianite leader who was killed the day the plague came at Peor.”"
Numbers,26,1,"After the plague, the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,"
Numbers,26,2,“Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their ancestral houses of those 20 years old or more who can serve in Israel’s army.”
Numbers,26,3,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest said to them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho,"

Numbers,27,18,"The LORD replied to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man who has the Spirit in him, and lay your hands on him."

Numbers,27,20,Confer some of your authority on him so that the entire Israelite community will obey him.

Numbers,30,1,"Moses told the leaders of the Israelite tribes, “This is what the LORD has commanded:"
Numbers,30,2,"When a man makes a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to put himself under an obligation, he must not break his word; he must do whatever he has promised."
Numbers,30,3,"“When a woman in her father’s house during her youth makes a vow to the LORD or puts herself under an obligation,"
Numbers,30,4,"and her father hears about her vow or the obligation she put herself under, and he says nothing to her, all her vows and every obligation she put herself under are binding."
Numbers,30,5,"But if her father prohibits her on the day he hears about it, none of her vows and none of the obligations she put herself under are binding. The LORD will absolve her because her father has prohibited her."
Numbers,30,6,"“If a woman marries while her vows or the rash commitment she herself made are binding,"
Numbers,30,7,"and her husband hears about it and says nothing to her when he finds out, her vows are binding, and the obligations she put herself under are binding."

Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband cancels them on the day he hears about it, nothing that came from her lips, whether her vows or her obligation, is binding. Her husband has canceled them, and the LORD will absolve her."
Numbers,30,13,Her husband may confirm or cancel any vow or any sworn obligation to deny herself.
Numbers,30,14,"If her husband says nothing at all to her from day to day, he confirms all her vows and obligations, which are binding. He has confirmed them because he said nothing to her when he heard about them."
Numbers,30,15,"But if he cancels them after he hears about them, he will be responsible for her commitment.”"
Numbers,30,16,"These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the relationship between a man and his wife, or between a father and his daughter in his house during her youth."
Numbers,31,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses,"
Numbers,31,2,"“Execute vengeance for the Israelites against the Midianites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”"
Numbers,31,3,"So Moses spoke to the people, “Equip some of your men for war. They will go against Midian to inflict the LORD’s vengeance on them."
Numbers,31,4,"Send 1,000 men to war from each Israelite tribe.”"
Numbers,31,5,"So 1,000 were recruited from each Israelite tribe out of the thousands in Israel—12,000 equipped for war."
Numbers,31,6,"Moses sent 1,000 from each tribe to war. They went with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, in whose care were the holy objects and signal trumpets."
Numbers,31,7,"They waged war against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and killed every male."
Numbers,31,8,"Along with the others slain by them, they killed the Midianite kings—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,"The Israelites took the Midianite women and their children captive, and they plundered all their cattle, flocks, and property."
Numbers,31,10,"Then they burned all the cities where the Midianites lived, as well as all their encampments,"
Numbers,31,11,"and took away all the spoils of war and the captives, both man and beast."
Numbers,31,12,"They brought the prisoners, animals, and spoils of war to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the Israelite community at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,"Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp."
Numbers,31,14,"But Moses became furious with the officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, who were returning from the military campaign."
Numbers,31,15,“Have you let every female live?” he asked them.
Numbers,31,16,"“Yet they are the ones who, at Balaam’s advice, incited the Israelites to unfaithfulness against the LORD in the Peor incident, so that the plague came against the LORD’s community."
Numbers,31,17,"So now, kill all the male children and kill every woman who has had sexual relations with a man,"
Numbers,31,18,but keep alive for yourselves all the young females who have not had sexual relations.
Numbers,31,19,“You are to remain outside the camp for seven days. All of you and your prisoners who have killed a person or touched the dead are to purify yourselves on the third day and the seventh day.
Numbers,31,20,"Also purify everything: garments, leather goods, things made of goat hair, and every article of wood.”"
Numbers,31,21,"Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone to battle, “This is the legal statute the LORD commanded Moses:"
Numbers,31,22,"Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead—"
Numbers,31,23,"everything that can withstand fire—you are to pass through fire, and it will be clean. It must still be purified with the purification water. Anything that cannot withstand fire, pass through the water."
Numbers,31,24,"On the seventh day wash your clothes, and you will be clean. After that you may enter the camp.”"
Numbers,31,25,"The LORD told Moses,"
Numbers,31,26,"“You, Eleazar the priest, and the family leaders of the community are to take a count of what was captured, man and beast."
Numbers,31,27,Then divide the captives between the troops who went out to war and the entire community.
Numbers,31,28,"Set aside a tribute for the LORD from what belongs to the fighting men who went out to war: one out of every 500 humans, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats."
Numbers,31,29,Take the tribute from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD.
Numbers,31,30,"From the Israelites’ half, take one out of every 50 from the people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats, all the livestock, and give them to the Levites who perform the duties of the LORD’s tabernacle.”"
Numbers,31,31,So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"The captives remaining from the plunder the army had taken totaled: 675,000 sheep and goats,"
Numbers,31,33,"72,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,34,"61,000 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,35,"and 32,000 people, all the females who had not had sexual relations with a man."
Numbers,31,36,"The half portion for those who went out to war numbered: 337,500 sheep and goats,"
Numbers,31,37,and the tribute to the LORD was 675 from the sheep and goats;
Numbers,31,38,"from the 36,000 cattle, the tribute to the LORD was 72;"
Numbers,31,39,"from the 30,500 donkeys, the tribute to the LORD was 61;"
Numbers,31,40,"and from the 16,000 people, the tribute to the LORD was 32 people."
Numbers,31,41,"Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as a contribution for the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"From the Israelites’ half, which Moses separated from the men who fought,"
Numbers,31,43,"the community’s half was: 337,500 sheep and goats,"
Numbers,31,44,"36,000 cattle,"
Numbers,31,45,"30,500 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,46,"and 16,000 people."
Numbers,31,47,"Moses took one out of every 50, selected from the people and the livestock of the Israelites’ half. He gave them to the Levites who perform the duties of the LORD’s tabernacle, as the LORD had commanded him."
Numbers,31,48,"The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, approached Moses"
Numbers,31,49,"and told him, “Your servants have taken a census of the fighting men under our command, and not one of us is missing."
Numbers,31,50,"So we have presented to the LORD an offering of the gold articles each man found—armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”"
Numbers,31,51,Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them all the articles made out of gold.
Numbers,31,52,"All the gold of the contribution they offered to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, was 420 pounds."
Numbers,31,53,Each of the soldiers had taken plunder for himself.
Numbers,31,54,Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
Numbers,32,1,"The Reubenites and Gadites had a very large number of livestock. When they surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, they saw that the region was a good one for livestock."
Numbers,32,2,"So the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community and said:"
Numbers,32,3,"“The territory of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,"
Numbers,32,4,"which the LORD struck down before the community of Israel, is good land for livestock, and your servants own livestock.”"
Numbers,32,5,"They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Don’t make us cross the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,6,"But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your brothers go to war while you stay here?"
Numbers,32,7,Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land the LORD has given them?
Numbers,32,8,That’s what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers,32,9,"After they went up as far as Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them."
Numbers,32,10,"So the LORD’s anger burned that day, and He swore an oath:"
Numbers,32,11,"‘Because they did not follow Me completely, none of the men 20 years old or more who came up from Egypt will see the land I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—"
Numbers,32,12,"none except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they did follow the LORD completely.’"
Numbers,32,13,"The LORD’s anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness 40 years until the whole generation that had done what was evil in the LORD’s sight was gone."
Numbers,32,14,"And here you, a brood of sinners, stand in your fathers’ place adding even more to the LORD’s burning anger against Israel."
Numbers,32,15,"If you turn back from following Him, He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will destroy all of them.”"
Numbers,32,16,"Then they approached him and said, “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our dependents."
Numbers,32,17,"But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place. Meanwhile, our dependents will remain in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has taken possession of his inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,"Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance will be across the Jordan to the east.”"
Numbers,32,20,"Moses replied to them, “If you do this—if you arm yourselves for battle before the LORD,"
Numbers,32,21,"and every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies from His presence,"
Numbers,32,22,and the land is subdued before the LORD—afterward you may return and be free from obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD.
Numbers,32,23,"But if you don’t do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD; be sure your sin will catch up with you."
Numbers,32,24,"Build cities for your dependents and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”"
Numbers,32,25,"The Gadites and Reubenites answered Moses, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands."
Numbers,32,26,"Our little children, wives, livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead,"
Numbers,32,27,but your servants are equipped for war before the LORD and will go across to the battle as my lord orders.”
Numbers,32,28,"So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the family leaders of the Israelite tribes."
Numbers,32,29,"Moses told them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, every man in battle formation before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession."
Numbers,32,30,"But if they don’t go across with you in battle formation, they must accept land in Canaan with you.”"
Numbers,32,31,"The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “What the LORD has spoken to your servants is what we will do."
Numbers,32,32,"We will cross over in battle formation before the LORD into the land of Canaan, but we will keep our hereditary possession across the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,33,"So Moses gave them—the Gadites, Reubenites, and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph—the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land including its cities with the territories surrounding them."
Numbers,32,34,"The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,"
Numbers,32,35,"Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,"
Numbers,32,36,"Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and built sheepfolds."
Numbers,32,37,"The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,"
Numbers,32,38,"as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt."
Numbers,32,39,"The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled in it."
Numbers,32,41,"Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages, which he renamed Jair’s Villages."
Numbers,32,42,Nobah went and captured Kenath with its villages and called it Nobah after his own name.
Numbers,33,1,These were the stages of the Israelites’ journey when they went out of the land of Egypt by their military divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers,33,2,"At the LORD’s command, Moses wrote down the starting points for the stages of their journey; these are the stages listed by their starting points:"
Numbers,33,3,"They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the month. On the day after the Passover the Israelites went out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians."
Numbers,33,4,"Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying every firstborn male the LORD had struck down among them, for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods."
Numbers,33,5,The Israelites departed from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
Numbers,33,6,"They departed from Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness."
Numbers,33,7,"They departed from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,They departed from Pi-hahiroth and crossed through the middle of the sea into the wilderness. They took a three-day journey into the Wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
Numbers,33,9,"They departed from Marah and came to Elim. There were 12 springs of water and 70 date palms at Elim, so they camped there."
Numbers,33,10,They departed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers,33,11,They departed from the Red Sea and camped in the Wilderness of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,They departed from the Wilderness of Sin and camped in Dophkah.
Numbers,33,13,They departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
Numbers,33,14,"They departed from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink."
Numbers,33,15,They departed from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,33,16,They departed from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
Numbers,33,17,They departed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,They departed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
Numbers,33,19,They departed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
Numbers,33,20,They departed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
Numbers,33,21,They departed from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
Numbers,33,22,They departed from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
Numbers,33,23,They departed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
Numbers,33,24,They departed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
Numbers,33,25,They departed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,They departed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,They departed from Tahath and camped at Terah.
Numbers,33,28,They departed from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
Numbers,33,29,They departed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
Numbers,33,30,They departed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
Numbers,33,31,They departed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
Numbers,33,32,They departed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
Numbers,33,33,They departed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers,33,34,They departed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers,33,35,They departed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
Numbers,33,36,"They departed from Ezion-geber and camped in the Wilderness of Zin (that is, Kadesh)."
Numbers,33,37,They departed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor on the edge of the land of Edom.
Numbers,33,38,"At the LORD’s command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor and died there on the first day of the fifth month in the fortieth year after the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt."
Numbers,33,39,Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,"At that time the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard the Israelites were coming."
Numbers,33,41,They departed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,They departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers,33,43,They departed from Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,33,44,They departed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab.
Numbers,33,45,They departed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
Numbers,33,46,They departed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
Numbers,33,47,They departed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the Abarim range facing Nebo.
Numbers,33,48,They departed from the Abarim range and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Numbers,33,49,They camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth to the Acacia Meadow on the plains of Moab.
Numbers,33,50,"The LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho,"
Numbers,33,51,"“Tell the Israelites: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,33,52,"you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, destroy all their stone images and cast images, and demolish all their high places."
Numbers,33,53,You are to take possession of the land and settle in it because I have given you the land to possess.
Numbers,33,54,You are to receive the land as an inheritance by lot according to your clans. Increase the inheritance for a large clan and decrease it for a small one. Whatever place the lot indicates for someone will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to your ancestral tribes.
Numbers,33,55,"But if you don’t drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become thorns in your eyes and in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you will live."
Numbers,33,56,"And what I had planned to do to them, I will do to you.”"
Numbers,34,1,"The LORD spoke to Moses,"
Numbers,34,2,"“Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these borders:"
Numbers,34,3,Your southern side will be from the Wilderness of Zin along the boundary of Edom. Your southern border on the east will begin at the east end of the Dead Sea.
Numbers,34,4,"Your border will turn south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, proceed to Zin, and end south of Kadesh-barnea. It will go to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon."
Numbers,34,5,"The border will turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, where it will end at the Mediterranean Sea."
Numbers,34,6,Your western border will be the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea; this will be your western border.
Numbers,34,7,This will be your northern border: From the Mediterranean Sea draw a line to Mount Hor;
Numbers,34,8,"from Mount Hor draw a line to the entrance of Hamath, and the border will reach Zedad."
Numbers,34,9,Then the border will go to Ziphron and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your northern border.
Numbers,34,10,"For your eastern border, draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham."
Numbers,34,11,The border will go down from Shepham to Riblah east of Ain. It will continue down and reach the eastern slope of the Sea of Chinnereth.
Numbers,34,12,Then the border will go down to the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. This will be your land defined by its borders on all sides.”
Numbers,34,13,"So Moses commanded the Israelites, “This is the land you are to receive by lot as an inheritance, which the LORD commanded to be given to the nine and a half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"For the tribe of the Reubenites and the tribe of the Gadites have received their inheritance according to their ancestral houses, and half the tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance."
Numbers,34,15,"The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, eastward toward the sunrise.”"
Numbers,34,16,"The LORD spoke to Moses,"
Numbers,34,17,“These are the names of the men who are to distribute the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
Numbers,34,18,Take one leader from each tribe to distribute the land.
Numbers,34,19,These are the names of the men: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;
Numbers,34,20,Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon;
Numbers,34,21,Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin;
Numbers,34,22,"Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan;"
Numbers,34,23,"from the sons of Joseph: Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh,"
Numbers,34,24,"Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim;"
Numbers,34,25,"Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun;"
Numbers,34,26,"Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar;"
Numbers,34,27,"Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher;"
Numbers,34,28,"Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”"
Numbers,34,29,These are the ones the LORD commanded to distribute the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,The LORD again spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho:
Numbers,35,2,“Command the Israelites to give cities out of their hereditary property for the Levites to live in and pastureland around the cities.
Numbers,35,3,"The cities will be for them to live in, and their pasturelands will be for their herds, flocks, and all their other animals."
Numbers,35,4,The pasturelands of the cities you are to give the Levites will extend from the city wall 500 yards on every side.
Numbers,35,5,"Measure 1,000 yards outside the city for the east side, 1,000 yards for the south side, 1,000 yards for the west side, and 1,000 yards for the north side, with the city in the center. This will belong to them as pasturelands for the cities."
Numbers,35,6,"“The cities you give the Levites will include six cities of refuge, which you must provide so that the one who kills someone may flee there; in addition to these, give 42 other cities."
Numbers,35,7,"The total number of cities you give the Levites will be 48, along with their pasturelands."
Numbers,35,8,"Of the cities that you give from the Israelites’ territory, you should take more from a larger tribe and less from a smaller one. Each tribe is to give some of its cities to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance it receives.”"
Numbers,35,9,"The LORD said to Moses,"
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers,35,11,"designate cities to serve as cities of refuge for you, so that a person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there."
Numbers,35,12,"You will have the cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the one who kills someone will not die until he stands trial before the assembly."
Numbers,35,13,The cities you select will be your six cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,14,Select three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan to be cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,15,"These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or temporary resident among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there."
Numbers,35,16,"“If anyone strikes a person with an iron object and death results, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"If a man has in his hand a stone capable of causing death and strikes another person and he dies, the murderer must be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"If a man has in his hand a wooden object capable of causing death and strikes another person and he dies, the murderer must be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,"The avenger of blood himself is to kill the murderer; when he finds him, he is to kill him."
Numbers,35,20,"Likewise, if anyone in hatred pushes a person or throws an object at him with malicious intent and he dies,"
Numbers,35,21,"or if in hostility he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who struck him must be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood is to kill the murderer when he finds him."
Numbers,35,22,“But if anyone suddenly pushes a person without hostility or throws any object at him without malicious intent
Numbers,35,23,"or without looking drops a stone that could kill a person and he dies, but he was not his enemy and wasn’t trying to harm him,"
Numbers,35,24,the assembly is to judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
Numbers,35,25,"The assembly is to protect the one who kills someone from the hand of the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge he fled to, and he must live there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,"“If the one who kills someone ever goes outside the border of the city of refuge he fled to,"
Numbers,35,27,"and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge and kills him, the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed,"
Numbers,35,28,for the one who killed a person was supposed to live in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of the high priest may the one who has killed a person return to the land he possesses.
Numbers,35,29,These instructions will be a statutory ordinance for you throughout your generations wherever you live.
Numbers,35,30,"“If anyone kills a person, the murderer is to be put to death based on the word of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death based on the testimony of one witness."
Numbers,35,31,You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of killing someone; he must be put to death.
Numbers,35,32,"Neither should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to his city of refuge, allowing him to return and live in the land before the death of the high priest."
Numbers,35,33,"“Do not defile the land where you are, for bloodshed defiles the land, and there can be no atonement for the land because of the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of the person who shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"Do not make the land unclean where you live and where I reside; for I, Yahweh, reside among the Israelites.”"
Numbers,36,1,"The family leaders from the clan of the descendants of Gilead—the son of Machir, son of Manasseh—who were from the clans of the sons of Joseph, approached and addressed Moses and the leaders who were over the Israelite families."
Numbers,36,2,"They said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites. My lord was further commanded by Yahweh to give our brother Zelophehad’s inheritance to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"If they marry any of the men from the other Israelite tribes, their inheritance will be taken away from our fathers’ inheritance and added to that of the tribe into which they marry. Therefore, part of our allotted inheritance would be taken away."
Numbers,36,4,"When the Jubilee comes for the Israelites, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe.”"
Numbers,36,5,"So Moses commanded the Israelites at the word of the LORD, “What the tribe of Joseph’s descendants says is right."
Numbers,36,6,This is what the LORD has commanded concerning Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone they like provided they marry within a clan of their ancestral tribe.
Numbers,36,7,"An inheritance belonging to the Israelites must not transfer from tribe to tribe, because each of the Israelites is to retain the inheritance of his ancestral tribe."
Numbers,36,8,"Any daughter who possesses an inheritance from an Israelite tribe must marry someone from the clan of her ancestral tribe, so that each of the Israelites will possess the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,"No inheritance is to transfer from one tribe to another, because each of the Israelite tribes is to retain its inheritance.”"
Numbers,36,10,The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers,36,11,"Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married cousins on their father’s side."
Numbers,36,12,"They married men from the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father’s clan."
Numbers,36,13,These are the commands and ordinances the LORD commanded the Israelites through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses told the Israelites everything the LORD had commanded him to say to them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying:"
Deuteronomy,1,6,“The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb: ‘You have stayed at this mountain long enough.
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites and their neighbors in the Arabah, the hill country, the Judean foothills, the Negev and the sea coast—to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon as far as the Euphrates River."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have set the land before you. Enter and take possession of the land the LORD swore to give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their future descendants.’"
Deuteronomy,1,9,“I said to you at that time: I can’t bear the responsibility for you on my own.
Deuteronomy,1,10,The LORD your God has so multiplied you that today you are as numerous as the stars of the sky.
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May Yahweh, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times more, and bless you as He promised you."
Deuteronomy,1,12,"But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes by myself?"
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Appoint for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will make them your leaders."
Deuteronomy,1,14,"“You replied to me, ‘What you propose to do is good.’"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"“So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and set them over you as leaders: officials for thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"I commanded your judges at that time: Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge rightly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Do not show partiality when deciding a case; listen to small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it."
Deuteronomy,1,18,At that time I commanded you about all the things you were to do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"“We then set out from Horeb and went across all the great and terrible wilderness you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,"
Deuteronomy,1,20,"I said to you: You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"See, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged."
Deuteronomy,1,22,"“Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let’s send men ahead of us, so that they may explore the land for us and bring us back a report about the route we should go up and the cities we will come to.’"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The plan seemed good to me, so I selected 12 men from among you, one man for each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"They left and went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol, scouting the land."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They took some of the fruit from the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us back a report: ‘The land the LORD our God is giving us is good.’"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"“But you were not willing to go up, rebelling against the command of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You grumbled in your tents and said, ‘The LORD brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites so they would destroy us, because He hated us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go? Our brothers have discouraged us, saying: The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, fortified to the heavens. We also saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’"
Deuteronomy,1,29,“So I said to you: Don’t be terrified or afraid of them!
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God who goes before you will fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt."
Deuteronomy,1,31,And you saw in the wilderness how the LORD your God carried you as a man carries his son all along the way you traveled until you reached this place.
Deuteronomy,1,32,"But in spite of this you did not trust the LORD your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,who went before you on the journey to seek out a place for you to camp. He went in the fire by night and in the cloud by day to guide you on the road you were to travel.
Deuteronomy,1,34,"“When the LORD heard your words, He grew angry and swore an oath:"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"‘None of these men in this evil generation will see the good land I swore to give your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he followed the LORD completely.’"
Deuteronomy,1,37,“The LORD was angry with me also because of you and said: ‘You will not enter there either.
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Joshua son of Nun, who attends you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Your little children, whom you said would be plunder, your sons who don’t know good from evil, will enter there. I will give them the land, and they will take possession of it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,But you are to turn back and head for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.’
Deuteronomy,1,41,"“You answered me, ‘We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight just as the LORD our God commanded us.’ Then each of you put on his weapons of war and thought it would be easy to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"“But the LORD said to me, ‘Tell them: Don’t go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from being defeated by your enemies.’"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you, but you didn’t listen. You rebelled against the LORD’s command and defiantly went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,Then the Amorites who lived there came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir as far as Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"When you returned, you wept before the LORD, but He didn’t listen to your requests or pay attention to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,For this reason you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did.
Deuteronomy,2,1,"“Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had told me, and we traveled around the hill country of Seir for many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"The LORD then said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,‘You’ve been traveling around this hill country long enough; turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Command the people: You are about to travel through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so you must be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Don’t fight with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even an inch of it, because I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You may purchase food from them with silver, so that you may eat, and buy water from them to drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this immense wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you this past 40 years, and you have lacked nothing.’"
Deuteronomy,2,8,"“So we bypassed our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah road and from Elath and Ezion-geber. We traveled along the road to the Wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"The LORD said to me, ‘Show no hostility toward Moab, and do not provoke them to battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"The Emim, a great and numerous people as tall as the Anakim, had previously lived there."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"They were also regarded as Rephaim, like the Anakim, though the Moabites called them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites had previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them completely and settling in their place, just as Israel did in the land of its possession the LORD gave them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"“The LORD said, ‘Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.’ So we crossed the Zered Valley."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was 38 years until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Indeed, the LORD’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp until they had all perished."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"“When all the fighting men had died among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"the LORD spoke to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,‘Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you get close to the Ammonites, don’t show any hostility to them or fight with them, for I will not give you any of the Ammonites’ land as a possession; I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,"This too used to be regarded as the land of the Rephaim. The Rephaim lived there previously, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,"
Deuteronomy,2,21,"a great and numerous people, tall as the Anakim. The LORD destroyed the Rephaim at the advance of the Ammonites, so that they drove them out and settled in their place."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"This was just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them; they drove them out and have lived in their place until now."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"The Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settled in their place."
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“The LORD also said, ‘Get up, move out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have handed Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land over to you. Begin to take possession of it; engage him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"Today I will begin to put the fear and dread of you on the peoples everywhere under heaven. They will hear the report about you, tremble, and be in anguish because of you.’"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"“So I sent messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon from the Wilderness of Kedemoth, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,‘Let us travel through your land; we will keep strictly to the highway. We will not turn to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You can sell us food in exchange for silver so we may eat, and give us water for silver so we may drink. Only let us travel through on foot,"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for us, and the Moabites who live in Ar, until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.’"
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us travel through his land, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to hand him over to you, as has now taken place."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"“Then the LORD said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take possession of it.’"
Deuteronomy,2,32,So Sihon and his whole army came out against us for battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,"The LORD our God handed him over to us, and we defeated him, his sons, and his whole army."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed the people of every city, including the women and children. We left no survivors."
Deuteronomy,2,35,We took only the livestock and the spoil from the cities we captured as plunder for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"There was no city that was inaccessible to us, from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead. The LORD our God gave everything to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"But you did not go near the Ammonites’ land, all along the bank of the Jabbok River, the cities of the hill country, or any place that the LORD our God had forbidden."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"“Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out against us with his whole army to do battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"But the LORD said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you along with his whole army and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,3,So the LORD our God also handed over Og king of Bashan and his whole army to us. We struck him until there was no survivor left.
Deuteronomy,3,4,"We captured all his cities at that time. There wasn’t a city that we didn’t take from them: 60 cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a large number of rural villages."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We completely destroyed them, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying the men, women, and children of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But we took all the livestock and the spoil from the cities as plunder for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"“At that time we took the land from the two Amorite kings across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon,"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"which the Sidonians call Sirion, but the Amorites call Senir,"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"all the cities of the plateau, Gilead, and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of Og’s kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed was made of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the Ammonites? It is 13 feet six inches long and six feet wide by a standard measure.)
Deuteronomy,3,12,"“At that time we took possession of this land. I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Aroer by the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead along with its cities."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og. The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took over the entire region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He called Bashan by his own name, Jair’s Villages, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,3,15,"I gave Gilead to Machir,"
Deuteronomy,3,16,"and I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites."
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The Arabah and Jordan are also borders from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,“I commanded you at that time: The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your fighting men will cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives, young children, and livestock—I know that you have a lot of livestock—will remain in the cities I have given you"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and they also take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession that I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,21,“I commanded Joshua at that time: Your own eyes have seen everything the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Don’t be afraid of them, for the LORD your God fights for you."
Deuteronomy,3,23,“At that time I begged the LORD:
Deuteronomy,3,24,"Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your greatness and power to Your servant, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can perform deeds and mighty acts like Yours?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Please let me cross over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon."
Deuteronomy,3,26,"“But the LORD was angry with me on account of you and would not listen to me. The LORD said to me, ‘That’s enough! Do not speak to Me again about this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west, north, south, and east, and see it with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit this land that you will see.’"
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we stayed in the valley facing Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"“Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live, enter, and take possession of the land Yahweh, the God of your fathers, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You must not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, so that you may keep the commands of the LORD your God I am giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed every one of you who followed Baal of Peor."
Deuteronomy,4,4,But you who have remained faithful to the LORD your God are all alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Carefully follow them, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples. When they hear about all these statutes, they will say, ‘This great nation is indeed a wise and understanding people.’"
Deuteronomy,4,7,For what great nation is there that has a god near to it as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call to Him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,And what great nation has righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"“Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don’t forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don’t slip from your mind as long as you live. Teach them to your children and your grandchildren."
Deuteronomy,4,10,"The day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, ‘Assemble the people before Me, and I will let them hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth and may instruct their children.’"
Deuteronomy,4,11,"You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire into the heavens and enveloped in a dense, black cloud."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"Then the LORD spoke to you from the fire. You kept hearing the sound of the words, but didn’t see a form; there was only a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"He declared His covenant to you. He commanded you to follow the Ten Commandments, which He wrote on two stone tablets."
Deuteronomy,4,14,At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to follow in the land you are about to cross into and possess.
Deuteronomy,4,15,"“For your own good, be extremely careful—because you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb—"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"not to act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"or the form of any beast on the earth, any winged creature that flies in the sky,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"any creature that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the waters under the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"When you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars—all the array of heaven—do not be led astray to bow down and worship them. The LORD your God has provided them for all people everywhere under heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the LORD selected you and brought you out of Egypt’s iron furnace to be a people for His inheritance, as you are today."
Deuteronomy,4,21,“The LORD was angry with me on your account. He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy,4,22,I won’t be crossing the Jordan because I am going to die in this land. But you are about to cross over and take possession of this good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that He made with you, and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of anything He has forbidden you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"“When you have children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and if you act corruptly, make an idol in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, provoking Him to anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not live long there, but you will certainly be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,4,27,"The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be reduced to a few survivors among the nations where the LORD your God will drive you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see, hear, eat, or smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But from there, you will search for the LORD your God, and you will find Him when you seek Him with all your heart and all your soul."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, you will return to the LORD your God in later days and obey Him."
Deuteronomy,4,31,"He will not leave you, destroy you, or forget the covenant with your fathers that He swore to them by oath, because the LORD your God is a compassionate God."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"“Indeed, ask about the earlier days that preceded you, from the day God created man on the earth and from one end of the heavens to the other: Has anything like this great event ever happened, or has anything like it been heard of?"
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Has a people heard God’s voice speaking from the fire as you have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has a god attempted to go and take a nation as his own out of another nation, by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,You were shown these things so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,"He let you hear His voice from heaven to instruct you. He showed you His great fire on earth, and you heard His words from the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power,"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as is now taking place."
Deuteronomy,4,39,"Today, recognize and keep in mind that the LORD is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Keep His statutes and commands, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper and so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you for all time.”"
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east.
Deuteronomy,4,42,"Someone could flee there who committed manslaughter, killing his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him. He could flee to one of these cities and stay alive:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau land, belonging to the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, belonging to the Gadites; or Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law Moses gave the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the decrees, statutes, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to them after they came out of Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"across the Jordan in the valley facing Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites. He lived in Heshbon, and Moses and the Israelites defeated him after they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan to the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon)"
Deuteronomy,4,49,and all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am proclaiming as you hear them today. Learn and follow them carefully."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with all of us who are alive here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The LORD spoke to you face to face from the fire on the mountain.
Deuteronomy,5,5,"At that time I was standing between the LORD and you to report the word of the LORD to you, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. And He said:"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Deuteronomy,5,7,Do not have other gods besides Me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,Do not make an idol for yourself in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"You must not bow down to them or worship them, because I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the fathers’ sin to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commands.
Deuteronomy,5,11,"Do not misuse the name of the LORD your God, because the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses His name."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Be careful to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy as the LORD your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,"You are to labor six days and do all your work,"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. You must not do any work—you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your ox or donkey, any of your livestock, or the foreigner who lives within your gates, so that your male and female slaves may rest as you do."
Deuteronomy,5,15,"Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day."
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and so that you may prosper in the land the LORD your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,Do not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,Do not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,Do not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,Do not give dishonest testimony against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"Do not covet your neighbor’s wife or desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"“The LORD spoke these commands in a loud voice to your entire assembly from the fire, cloud, and thick darkness on the mountain; He added nothing more. He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,5,23,All of you approached me with your tribal leaders and elders when you heard the voice from the darkness and while the mountain was blazing with fire.
Deuteronomy,5,24,"You said, ‘Look, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice from the fire. Today we have seen that God speaks with a person, yet he still lives."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who out of all mankind has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the fire, as we have, and lived?"
Deuteronomy,5,27,Go near and listen to everything the LORD our God says. Then you can tell us everything the LORD our God tells you; we will listen and obey.’
Deuteronomy,5,28,"“The LORD heard your words when you spoke to me. He said to me, ‘I have heard the words that these people have spoken to you. Everything they have said is right."
Deuteronomy,5,29,"If only they had such a heart to fear Me and keep all My commands always, so that they and their children will prosper forever."
Deuteronomy,5,30,Go and tell them: Return to your tents.
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But you stand here with Me, and I will tell you every command—the statutes and ordinances—you are to teach them, so that they may follow them in the land I am giving them to possess.’"
Deuteronomy,5,32,“Be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you are not to turn aside to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy,5,33,"Follow the whole instruction the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live, prosper, and have a long life in the land you will possess."
Deuteronomy,6,1,"“This is the command—the statutes and ordinances—the LORD your God has instructed me to teach you, so that you may follow them in the land you are about to enter and possess."
Deuteronomy,6,2,"Do this so that you may fear the LORD your God all the days of your life by keeping all His statutes and commands I am giving you, your son, and your grandson, and so that you may have a long life."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Listen, Israel, and be careful to follow them, so that you may prosper and multiply greatly, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"“Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One."
Deuteronomy,6,5,"Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength."
Deuteronomy,6,6,These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart.
Deuteronomy,6,7,"Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up."
Deuteronomy,6,8,Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be a symbol on your forehead.
Deuteronomy,6,9,Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"“When the LORD your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give you—a land with large and beautiful cities that you did not build,"
Deuteronomy,6,11,"houses full of every good thing that you did not fill them with, wells dug that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant—and when you eat and are satisfied,"
Deuteronomy,6,12,"be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Deuteronomy,6,13,"Fear Yahweh your God, worship Him, and take your oaths in His name."
Deuteronomy,6,14,"Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you,"
Deuteronomy,6,15,"for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God. Otherwise, the LORD your God will become angry with you and wipe you off the face of the earth."
Deuteronomy,6,16,Do not test the LORD your God as you tested Him at Massah.
Deuteronomy,6,17,"Carefully observe the commands of the LORD your God, the decrees and statutes He has commanded you."
Deuteronomy,6,18,"Do what is right and good in the LORD’s sight, so that you may prosper and so that you may enter and possess the good land the LORD your God swore to give your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,6,19,"by driving out all your enemies before you, as the LORD has said."
Deuteronomy,6,20,"“When your son asks you in the future, ‘What is the meaning of the decrees, statutes, and ordinances, which the LORD our God has commanded you?’"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"tell him, ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand."
Deuteronomy,6,22,"Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household,"
Deuteronomy,6,23,but He brought us from there in order to lead us in and give us the land that He swore to our fathers.
Deuteronomy,6,24,"The LORD commanded us to follow all these statutes and to fear the LORD our God for our prosperity always and for our preservation, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,6,25,"Righteousness will be ours if we are careful to follow every one of these commands before the LORD our God, as He has commanded us.’"
Deuteronomy,7,1,"“When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, and He drives out many nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and powerful than you—"
Deuteronomy,7,2,"and when the LORD your God delivers them over to you and you defeat them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy."
Deuteronomy,7,3,"Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,"
Deuteronomy,7,4,"because they will turn your sons away from Me to worship other gods. Then the LORD’s anger will burn against you, and He will swiftly destroy you."
Deuteronomy,7,5,"Instead, this is what you are to do to them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn up their carved images."
Deuteronomy,7,6,For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be His own possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy,7,7,"“The LORD was devoted to you and chose you, not because you were more numerous than all peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples."
Deuteronomy,7,8,"But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers, He brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the place of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,7,9,"Know that Yahweh your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commands."
Deuteronomy,7,10,But He directly pays back and destroys those who hate Him. He will not hesitate to directly pay back the one who hates Him.
Deuteronomy,7,11,So keep the command—the statutes and ordinances—that I am giving you to follow today.
Deuteronomy,7,12,"“If you listen to and are careful to keep these ordinances, the LORD your God will keep His covenant loyalty with you, as He swore to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,7,13,"He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will bless your descendants, and the produce of your land—your grain, new wine, and oil—the young of your herds, and the newborn of your flocks, in the land He swore to your fathers that He would give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,You will be blessed above all peoples; there will be no infertile male or female among you or your livestock.
Deuteronomy,7,15,"The LORD will remove all sickness from you; He will not put on you all the terrible diseases of Egypt that you know about, but He will inflict them on all who hate you."
Deuteronomy,7,16,"You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God is delivering over to you and not look on them with pity. Do not worship their gods, for that will be a snare to you."
Deuteronomy,7,17,"“If you say to yourself, ‘These nations are greater than I; how can I drive them out?’"
Deuteronomy,7,18,do not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:
Deuteronomy,7,19,"the great trials that you saw, the signs and wonders, the strong hand and outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you fear."
Deuteronomy,7,20,The LORD your God will also send the hornet against them until all the survivors and those hiding from you perish.
Deuteronomy,7,21,"Don’t be terrified of them, for the LORD your God, a great and awesome God, is among you."
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The LORD your God will drive out these nations before you little by little. You will not be able to destroy them all at once; otherwise, the wild animals will become too numerous for you."
Deuteronomy,7,23,The LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
Deuteronomy,7,24,"He will hand their kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will annihilate them."
Deuteronomy,7,25,"You must burn up the carved images of their gods. Don’t covet the silver and gold on the images and take it for yourself, or else you will be ensnared by it, for it is abhorrent to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"You must not bring any abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. You are to utterly detest and abhor it, because it is set apart for destruction."
Deuteronomy,8,1,"“You must carefully follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase, and may enter and take possession of the land the LORD swore to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,8,2,"Remember that the LORD your God led you on the entire journey these 40 years in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commands."
Deuteronomy,8,3,"He humbled you by letting you go hungry; then He gave you manna to eat, which you and your fathers had not known, so that you might learn that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD."
Deuteronomy,8,4,"Your clothing did not wear out, and your feet did not swell these 40 years."
Deuteronomy,8,5,Keep in mind that the LORD your God has been disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.
Deuteronomy,8,6,So keep the commands of the LORD your God by walking in His ways and fearing Him.
Deuteronomy,8,7,"For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with streams of water, springs, and deep water sources, flowing in both valleys and hills;"
Deuteronomy,8,8,"a land of wheat, barley, vines, figs, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;"
Deuteronomy,8,9,"a land where you will eat food without shortage, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and from whose hills you will mine copper."
Deuteronomy,8,10,"When you eat and are full, you will praise the LORD your God for the good land He has given you."
Deuteronomy,8,11,“Be careful that you don’t forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His command—the ordinances and statutes—I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy,8,12,"When you eat and are full, and build beautiful houses to live in,"
Deuteronomy,8,13,"and your herds and flocks grow large, and your silver and gold multiply, and everything else you have increases,"
Deuteronomy,8,14,"be careful that your heart doesn’t become proud and you forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Deuteronomy,8,15,"He led you through the great and terrible wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty land where there was no water. He brought water out of the flint-like rock for you."
Deuteronomy,8,16,"He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble and test you, so that in the end He might cause you to prosper."
Deuteronomy,8,17,"You may say to yourself, ‘My power and my own ability have gained this wealth for me,’"
Deuteronomy,8,18,"but remember that the LORD your God gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm His covenant He swore to your fathers, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,8,19,"If you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will perish."
Deuteronomy,8,20,"Like the nations the LORD is about to destroy before you, you will perish if you do not obey the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,9,1,"“Listen, Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go and drive out nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities fortified to the heavens."
Deuteronomy,9,2,"The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim. You know about them and you have heard it said about them, ‘Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?’"
Deuteronomy,9,3,"But understand that today the LORD your God will cross over ahead of you as a consuming fire; He will devastate and subdue them before you. You will drive them out and destroy them swiftly, as the LORD has told you."
Deuteronomy,9,4,"When the LORD your God drives them out before you, do not say to yourself, ‘The LORD brought me in to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.’ Instead, the LORD will drive out these nations before you because of their wickedness."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"You are not going to take possession of their land because of your righteousness or your integrity. Instead, the LORD your God will drive out these nations before you because of their wickedness, in order to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"Understand that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,“Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness. You have been rebelling against the LORD from the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place.
Deuteronomy,9,8,"You provoked the LORD at Horeb, and He was angry enough with you to destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant the LORD made with you, I stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights. I did not eat bread or drink water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,"On the day of the assembly the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by God’s finger. The exact words were on them, which the LORD spoke to you from the fire on the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,11,"The LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant, at the end of the 40 days and 40 nights."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"“The LORD said to me, ‘Get up and go down immediately from here. For your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned from the way that I commanded them; they have made a cast image for themselves.’"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"The LORD also said to me, ‘I have seen this people, and indeed, they are a stiff-necked people."
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Leave Me alone, and I will destroy them and blot out their name under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.’"
Deuteronomy,9,15,"“So I went back down the mountain, while it was blazing with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,I saw how you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made a calf image for yourselves. You had quickly turned from the way the LORD had commanded for you.
Deuteronomy,9,17,"So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands, shattering them before your eyes."
Deuteronomy,9,18,"Then I fell down like the first time in the presence of the LORD for 40 days and 40 nights; I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you committed, doing what was evil in the LORD’s sight and provoking Him to anger."
Deuteronomy,9,19,"I was afraid of the fierce anger the LORD had directed against you, because He was about to destroy you. But again the LORD listened to me on that occasion."
Deuteronomy,9,20,The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. But I prayed for Aaron at that time also.
Deuteronomy,9,21,"I took the sinful calf you had made, burned it up, and crushed it, thoroughly grinding it to powder as fine as dust. Then I threw it into the stream that came down from the mountain."
Deuteronomy,9,22,"“You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"When the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, He said, ‘Go up and possess the land I have given you’; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not believe or obey Him."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebelling against the LORD ever since I have known you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,“I fell down in the presence of the LORD 40 days and 40 nights because the LORD had threatened to destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed to the LORD: Lord GOD, do not annihilate Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a strong hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Disregard this people’s stubbornness, and their wickedness and sin."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"Otherwise, those in the land you brought us from will say, ‘Because the LORD wasn’t able to bring them into the land He had promised them, and because He hated them, He brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"But they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm."
Deuteronomy,10,1,"“The LORD said to me at that time, ‘Cut two stone tablets like the first ones and come to Me on the mountain and make a wooden ark."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you are to place them in the ark.’"
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and climbed the mountain with the two tablets in my hand."
Deuteronomy,10,4,"Then on the day of the assembly, the LORD wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain from the fire. The LORD gave them to me,"
Deuteronomy,10,5,"and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made. And they have remained there, as the LORD commanded me.”"
Deuteronomy,10,6,"The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. Aaron died and was buried there, and Eleazar his son became priest in his place."
Deuteronomy,10,7,"They traveled from there to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"“At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the LORD’s covenant, to stand before Yahweh to serve Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"For this reason, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance like his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God told him."
Deuteronomy,10,10,“I stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights like the first time. The LORD also listened to me on this occasion; He agreed not to annihilate you.
Deuteronomy,10,11,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to give their fathers.’"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"“And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you except to fear the LORD your God by walking in all His ways, to love Him, and to worship the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul?"
Deuteronomy,10,13,"Keep the LORD’s commands and statutes I am giving you today, for your own good."
Deuteronomy,10,14,"The heavens, indeed the highest heavens, belong to the LORD your God, as does the earth and everything in it."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"Yet the LORD was devoted to your fathers and loved them. He chose their descendants after them—He chose you out of all the peoples, as it is today."
Deuteronomy,10,16,"Therefore, circumcise your hearts and don’t be stiff-necked any longer."
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, showing no partiality and taking no bribe."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner, giving him food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"You also must love the foreigner, since you were foreigners in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,You are to fear Yahweh your God and worship Him. Remain faithful to Him and take oaths in His name.
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome works your eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your fathers went down to Egypt, 70 people in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"“Therefore, love the LORD your God and always keep His mandate and His statutes, ordinances, and commands."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"You must understand today that it is not your children who experienced or saw the discipline of the LORD your God: His greatness, strong hand, and outstretched arm;"
Deuteronomy,11,3,His signs and the works He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land;
Deuteronomy,11,4,"what He did to Egypt’s army, its horses and chariots, when He made the waters of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, and He destroyed them completely;"
Deuteronomy,11,5,what He did to you in the wilderness until you reached this place;
Deuteronomy,11,6,"and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when in the middle of the whole Israelite camp the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing with them."
Deuteronomy,11,7,Your own eyes have seen every great work the LORD has done.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"“Keep every command I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to cross into and possess the land you are to inherit,"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"and so that you may live long in the land the LORD swore to your fathers to give them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated by hand as in a vegetable garden."
Deuteronomy,11,11,"But the land you are entering to possess is a land of mountains and valleys, watered by rain from the sky."
Deuteronomy,11,12,It is a land the LORD your God cares for. He is always watching over it from the beginning to the end of the year.
Deuteronomy,11,13,"“If you carefully obey my commands I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all your heart and all your soul,"
Deuteronomy,11,14,"I will provide rain for your land in the proper time, the autumn and spring rains, and you will harvest your grain, new wine, and oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,I will provide grass in your fields for your livestock. You will eat and be satisfied.
Deuteronomy,11,16,"Be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside, worship, and bow down to other gods."
Deuteronomy,11,17,"Then the LORD’s anger will burn against you. He will close the sky, and there will be no rain; the land will not yield its produce, and you will perish quickly from the good land the LORD is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"“Imprint these words of mine on your hearts and minds, bind them as a sign on your hands, and let them be a symbol on your foreheads."

Deuteronomy,11,20,"Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"so that as long as the heavens are above the earth, your days and those of your children may be many in the land the LORD swore to give your fathers."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"For if you carefully observe every one of these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the LORD your God, walk in all His ways, and remain faithful to Him—"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will drive out nations greater and stronger than you are."
Deuteronomy,11,24,Every place the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.
Deuteronomy,11,25,"No one will be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will put fear and dread of you in all the land where you set foot, as He has promised you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"“Look, today I set before you a blessing and a curse:"
Deuteronomy,11,27,"there will be a blessing, if you obey the commands of the LORD your God I am giving you today,"
Deuteronomy,11,28,"and a curse, if you do not obey the commands of the LORD your God and you turn aside from the path I command you today by following other gods you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing at Mount Gerizim and the curse at Mount Ebal."
Deuteronomy,11,30,"Aren’t these mountains across the Jordan, beyond the western road in the land of the Canaanites, who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, near the oaks of Moreh?"
Deuteronomy,11,31,"For you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you possess it and settle in it,"
Deuteronomy,11,32,be careful to follow all the statutes and ordinances I set before you today.

Deuteronomy,12,3,"Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn up their Asherah poles, cut down the carved images of their gods, and wipe out their names from every place."

Deuteronomy,12,5,"Instead, you must turn to the place Yahweh your God chooses from all your tribes to put His name for His dwelling and go there."
Deuteronomy,12,6,"You are to bring there your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tenths and personal contributions, your vow offerings and freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"You will eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice with your household in everything you do, because the LORD your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,“You are not to do as we are doing here today; everyone is doing whatever seems right in his own eyes.
Deuteronomy,12,9,"Indeed, you have not yet come into the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy,12,10,"When you cross the Jordan and live in the land the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all the enemies around you and you live in security,"
Deuteronomy,12,11,"then Yahweh your God will choose the place to have His name dwell. Bring there everything I command you: your burnt offerings, sacrifices, offerings of the tenth, personal contributions, and all your choice offerings you vow to the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"You will rejoice before the LORD your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in all the sacred places you see.
Deuteronomy,12,14,"You must offer your burnt offerings only in the place the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, and there you must do everything I command you."
Deuteronomy,12,15,"“But whenever you want, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you. Those who are clean or unclean may eat it, as they would a gazelle or deer,"
Deuteronomy,12,16,but you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"Within your gates you may not eat: the tenth of your grain, new wine, or oil; the firstborn of your herd or flock; any of your vow offerings that you pledge; your freewill offerings; or your personal contributions."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"You must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God chooses—you, your son and daughter, your male and female slave, and the Levite who is within your gates. Rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you do,"
Deuteronomy,12,19,"and be careful not to neglect the Levite, as long as you live in your land."

Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place where Yahweh your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, you may slaughter any of your herd or flock He has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want."
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Indeed, you may eat it as the gazelle and deer are eaten; both the clean and the unclean may eat it."

Deuteronomy,12,26,“But you are to take the holy offerings you have and your vow offerings and go to the place the LORD chooses.
Deuteronomy,12,27,"Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your other sacrifices is to be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,28,"Be careful to obey all these things I command you, so that you and your children after you may prosper forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,12,29,"“When the LORD your God annihilates the nations before you, which you are entering to take possession of, and you drive them out and live in their land,"
Deuteronomy,12,30,"be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, asking, ‘How did these nations worship their gods? I’ll also do the same.’"
Deuteronomy,12,31,"You must not do the same to the LORD your God, because they practice every detestable thing, which the LORD hates, for their gods. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods."
Deuteronomy,12,32,You must be careful to do everything I command you; do not add anything to it or take anything away from it.
Deuteronomy,13,1,"“If a prophet or someone who has dreams arises among you and proclaims a sign or wonder to you,"
Deuteronomy,13,2,"and that sign or wonder he has promised you comes about, but he says, ‘Let us follow other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us worship them,’"
Deuteronomy,13,3,do not listen to that prophet’s words or to that dreamer. For the LORD your God is testing you to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul.
Deuteronomy,13,4,You must follow the LORD your God and fear Him. You must keep His commands and listen to His voice; you must worship Him and remain faithful to Him.
Deuteronomy,13,5,"That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he has urged rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the place of slavery, to turn you from the way the LORD your God has commanded you to walk. You must purge the evil from you."
Deuteronomy,13,6,"“If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, ‘Let us go and worship other gods’—which neither you nor your fathers have known,"
Deuteronomy,13,7,"any of the gods of the peoples around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other—"
Deuteronomy,13,8,"you must not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity, and do not spare him or shield him."
Deuteronomy,13,9,"Instead, you must kill him. Your hand is to be the first against him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people."
Deuteronomy,13,10,"Stone him to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery."
Deuteronomy,13,11,"All Israel will hear and be afraid, and they will no longer do anything evil like this among you."
Deuteronomy,13,12,"“If you hear it said about one of your cities the LORD your God is giving you to live in,"
Deuteronomy,13,13,"that wicked men have sprung up among you, led the inhabitants of their city astray, and said, ‘Let us go and worship other gods,’ which you have not known,"
Deuteronomy,13,14,"you are to inquire, investigate, and interrogate thoroughly. If the report turns out to be true that this detestable thing has happened among you,"
Deuteronomy,13,15,you must strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword. Completely destroy everyone in it as well as its livestock with the sword.
Deuteronomy,13,16,You are to gather all its spoil in the middle of the city square and completely burn up the city and all its spoil for the LORD your God. The city must remain a mound of ruins forever; it is not to be rebuilt.
Deuteronomy,13,17,"Nothing set apart for destruction is to remain in your hand, so that the LORD will turn from His burning anger and grant you mercy, show you compassion, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers."
Deuteronomy,13,18,"This will occur if you obey the LORD your God, keeping all His commands I am giving you today, doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,14,1,"“You are sons of the LORD your God; do not cut yourselves or make a bald spot on your head on behalf of the dead,"
Deuteronomy,14,2,for you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. The LORD has chosen you to be His own possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy,14,3,“You must not eat any detestable thing.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,You may eat any animal that has hooves divided in two and chews the cud.

Deuteronomy,14,8,"and the pig, though it has hooves, it does not chew the cud— it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses."
Deuteronomy,14,9,"“You may eat everything from the water that has fins and scales,"
Deuteronomy,14,10,but you may not eat anything that does not have fins and scales—it is unclean for you.

Deuteronomy,14,21,"“You are not to eat any carcass; you may give it to a temporary resident living within your gates, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. You must not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,“Each year you are to set aside a tenth of all the produce grown in your fields.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"You are to eat a tenth of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your herd and flock, in the presence of Yahweh your God at the place where He chooses to have His name dwell, so that you will always learn to fear the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,14,24,"But if the distance is too great for you to carry it, since the place where Yahweh your God chooses to put His name is too far away from you and since the LORD your God has blessed you,"
Deuteronomy,14,25,"then exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place the LORD your God chooses."

Deuteronomy,15,1,“At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
Deuteronomy,15,2,"This is how to cancel debt: Every creditor is to cancel what he has lent his neighbor. He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother, because the LORD’s release of debts has been proclaimed."
Deuteronomy,15,3,"You may collect something from a foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you."
Deuteronomy,15,4,"“There will be no poor among you, however, because the LORD is certain to bless you in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance—"

Deuteronomy,15,7,"“If there is a poor person among you, one of your brothers within any of your gates in the land the LORD your God is giving you, you must not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother."

Deuteronomy,15,9,"Be careful that there isn’t this wicked thought in your heart, ‘The seventh year, the year of canceling debts, is near,’ and you are stingy toward your poor brother and give him nothing. He will cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty."
Deuteronomy,15,10,"Give to him, and don’t have a stingy heart when you give, and because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you do."

Deuteronomy,15,16,"But if your slave says to you, ‘I don’t want to leave you,’ because he loves you and your family, and is well off with you,"
Deuteronomy,15,17,"take an awl and pierce through his ear into the door, and he will become your slave for life. Also treat your female slave the same way."

Deuteronomy,17,3,"and has gone to worship other gods by bowing down to the sun, moon, or all the stars in the sky—which I have forbidden—"
Deuteronomy,17,4,"and if you are told or hear about it, you must investigate it thoroughly. If the report turns out to be true that this detestable thing has happened in Israel,"
Deuteronomy,17,5,you must bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing and stone them to death.
Deuteronomy,17,6,The one condemned to die is to be executed on the testimony of two or three witnesses. No one is to be executed on the testimony of a single witness.
Deuteronomy,17,7,"The witnesses’ hands are to be the first in putting him to death, and after that, the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from you."

Deuteronomy,17,18,"When he is seated on his royal throne, he is to write a copy of this instruction for himself on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests."
Deuteronomy,17,19,"It is to remain with him, and he is to read from it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to observe all the words of this instruction, and to do these statutes."

Deuteronomy,18,12,"Everyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and the LORD your God is driving out the nations before you because of these detestable things."

Deuteronomy,18,15,“The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.

Deuteronomy,18,17,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘They have spoken well."
Deuteronomy,18,18,"I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him."

Deuteronomy,18,20,"But the prophet who dares to speak a message in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods—that prophet must die.’"
Deuteronomy,18,21,"You may say to yourself, ‘How can we recognize a message the LORD has not spoken?’"
Deuteronomy,18,22,"When a prophet speaks in the LORD’s name, and the message does not come true or is not fulfilled, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him."

Deuteronomy,19,2,you are to set apart three cities for yourselves within the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
Deuteronomy,19,3,"You are to determine the distances and divide the land the LORD your God is granting you as an inheritance into three regions, so that anyone who commits manslaughter can flee to these cities."
Deuteronomy,19,4,"“Here is the law concerning a case of someone who kills a person and flees there to save his life, having killed his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him:"
Deuteronomy,19,5,"If he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings the ax to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies, that person may flee to one of these cities and live."
Deuteronomy,19,6,"Otherwise, the avenger of blood in the heat of his anger might pursue the one who committed manslaughter, overtake him because the distance is great, and strike him dead. Yet he did not deserve to die, since he did not previously hate his neighbor."
Deuteronomy,19,7,This is why I am commanding you to set apart three cities for yourselves.
Deuteronomy,19,8,"If the LORD your God enlarges your territory as He swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land He promised to give them—"
Deuteronomy,19,9,"provided you keep every one of these commands I am giving you today and follow them, loving the LORD your God and walking in His ways at all times—you are to add three more cities to these three."
Deuteronomy,19,10,"In this way, innocent blood will not be shed, and you will not become guilty of bloodshed in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,19,11,"But if someone hates his neighbor, lies in ambush for him, attacks him, and strikes him fatally, and flees to one of these cities,"
Deuteronomy,19,12,"the elders of his city must send for him, take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood and he will die."

Deuteronomy,19,16,"“If a malicious witness testifies against someone accusing him of a crime,"
Deuteronomy,19,17,the two people in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and judges in authority at that time.
Deuteronomy,19,18,"The judges are to make a careful investigation, and if the witness turns out to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother,"

Deuteronomy,20,3,"He is to say to them: ‘Listen, Israel: Today you are about to engage in battle with your enemies. Do not be cowardly. Do not be afraid, alarmed, or terrified because of them."
Deuteronomy,20,4,For the LORD your God is the One who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.’

Deuteronomy,20,9,"When the officers have finished addressing the army, they will appoint military commanders to lead it."
Deuteronomy,20,10,"“When you approach a city to fight against it, you must make an offer of peace."
Deuteronomy,20,11,"If it accepts your offer of peace and opens its gates to you, all the people found in it will become forced laborers for you and serve you."
Deuteronomy,20,12,"However, if it does not make peace with you but wages war against you, lay siege to it."
Deuteronomy,20,13,"When the LORD your God hands it over to you, you must strike down all its males with the sword."
Deuteronomy,20,14,"But you may take the women, children, animals, and whatever else is in the city—all its spoil—as plunder. You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you."
Deuteronomy,20,15,This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and are not among the cities of these nations.
Deuteronomy,20,16,"However, you must not let any living thing survive among the cities of these people the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,20,17,"You must completely destroy them—the Hittite, Amorite, Canaanite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite—as the LORD your God has commanded you,"
Deuteronomy,20,18,"so that they won’t teach you to do all the detestable things they do for their gods, and you sin against the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"“When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it in order to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can get food from them. You must not cut them down. Are trees of the field human, to come under siege by you?"
Deuteronomy,20,20,"But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce food. You may cut them down to build siege works against the city that is waging war against you, until it falls."
Deuteronomy,21,1,"“If a murder victim is found lying in a field in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him,"
Deuteronomy,21,2,your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance from the victim to the nearby cities.
Deuteronomy,21,3,The elders of the city nearest to the victim are to get a young cow that has not been yoked or used for work.
Deuteronomy,21,4,"The elders of that city will bring the cow down to a continually flowing stream, to a place not tilled or sown, and they will break its neck there by the stream."
Deuteronomy,21,5,"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, will come forward, for Yahweh your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in His name, and they are to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault."

Deuteronomy,21,7,"They will declare, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood; our eyes did not see it."

Deuteronomy,21,12,"you are to bring her into your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,"
Deuteronomy,21,13,"remove the clothes she was wearing when she was taken prisoner, live in your house, and mourn for her father and mother a full month. After that, you may have sexual relations with her and be her husband, and she will be your wife."
Deuteronomy,21,14,"Then if you are not satisfied with her, you are to let her go where she wants, but you must not sell her for money or treat her as merchandise, because you have humiliated her."

Deuteronomy,21,19,"his father and mother must take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown."
Deuteronomy,21,20,"They will say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he doesn’t obey us. He’s a glutton and a drunkard.’"
Deuteronomy,21,21,"Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. You must purge the evil from you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid."
Deuteronomy,21,22,"“If anyone is found guilty of an offense deserving the death penalty and is executed, and you hang his body on a tree,"
Deuteronomy,21,23,"you are not to leave his corpse on the tree overnight but are to bury him that day, for anyone hung on a tree is under God’s curse. You must not defile the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."

Deuteronomy,22,14,"and accuses her of shameful conduct, and gives her a bad name, saying, ‘I married this woman and was intimate with her, but I didn’t find any evidence of her virginity,’"
Deuteronomy,22,15,the young woman’s father and mother will take the evidence of her virginity and bring it to the city elders at the gate.
Deuteronomy,22,16,"The young woman’s father will say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he hates her."
Deuteronomy,22,17,"He has accused her of shameful conduct, saying: “I didn’t find any evidence of your daughter’s virginity,” but here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity.’ They will spread out the cloth before the city elders."
Deuteronomy,22,18,Then the elders of that city will take the man and punish him.
Deuteronomy,22,19,"They will also fine him 100 silver shekels and give them to the young woman’s father, because that man gave an Israelite virgin a bad name. She will remain his wife; he cannot divorce her as long as he lives."
Deuteronomy,22,20,"But if this accusation is true and no evidence of the young woman’s virginity is found,"
Deuteronomy,22,21,"they will bring the woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city will stone her to death. For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from you."
Deuteronomy,22,22,"“If a man is discovered having sexual relations with another man’s wife, both the man who had sex with the woman and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel."
Deuteronomy,22,23,"If there is a young woman who is a virgin engaged to a man, and another man encounters her in the city and has sex with her,"
Deuteronomy,22,24,you must take the two of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death—the young woman because she did not cry out in the city and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s fiancée. You must purge the evil from you.
Deuteronomy,22,25,"But if the man encounters an engaged woman in the open country, and he seizes and rapes her, only the man who raped her must die."
Deuteronomy,22,26,"Do nothing to the young woman, because she is not guilty of an offense deserving death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him."
Deuteronomy,22,27,"When he found her in the field, the engaged woman cried out, but there was no one to rescue her."
Deuteronomy,22,28,"If a man encounters a young woman, a virgin who is not engaged, takes hold of her and rapes her, and they are discovered,"
Deuteronomy,22,29,"the man who raped her must give the young woman’s father 50 silver shekels, and she must become his wife because he violated her. He cannot divorce her as long as he lives."
