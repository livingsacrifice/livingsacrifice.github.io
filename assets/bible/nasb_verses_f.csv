Ephesians,1,12,to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians,1,13,"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,"
Ephesians,1,14,"who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory."
Ephesians,1,15,"For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints,"
Ephesians,1,16,"do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers;"
Ephesians,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him."
Ephesians,1,18,"I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,"
Ephesians,1,19,and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might
Ephesians,1,20,"which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,"
Ephesians,1,21,"far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come."
Ephesians,1,22,"And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,"
Ephesians,1,23,"which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,"And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,"
Ephesians,2,2,"in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience."
Ephesians,2,3,"Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,"
Ephesians,2,5,"even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),"
Ephesians,2,6,"and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,"
Ephesians,2,7,so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,2,8,"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;"
Ephesians,2,9,"not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
Ephesians,2,11,"Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed in the flesh by human hands—"
Ephesians,2,12,"remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians,2,14,"For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,"
Ephesians,2,15,"by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,"
Ephesians,2,16,"and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity."
Ephesians,2,17,"AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;"
Ephesians,2,18,for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household,"
Ephesians,2,20,"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,"
Ephesians,2,21,"in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,"
Ephesians,2,22,in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—"
Ephesians,3,2,if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you;
Ephesians,3,3,"that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief."
Ephesians,3,4,"By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,"
Ephesians,3,5,"which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;"
Ephesians,3,6,"to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,"
Ephesians,3,7,"of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power."
Ephesians,3,8,"To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,"
Ephesians,3,9,and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;
Ephesians,3,10,so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.
Ephesians,3,11,"This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,"
Ephesians,3,12,in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
Ephesians,3,13,"Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,"For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,"
Ephesians,3,15,"from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,"
Ephesians,3,16,"that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,"
Ephesians,3,17,"so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
Ephesians,3,18,"may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,"
Ephesians,3,19,"and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,"Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,"
Ephesians,3,21,to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians,4,1,"Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,"
Ephesians,4,2,"with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,"
Ephesians,4,3,being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;"
Ephesians,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
Ephesians,4,6,one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
Ephesians,4,7,But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Ephesians,4,8,"Therefore it says, “WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"(Now this expression, “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,"
Ephesians,4,12,"for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;"
Ephesians,4,13,"until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ."
Ephesians,4,14,"As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;"
Ephesians,4,15,"but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,"
Ephesians,4,16,"from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."
Ephesians,4,17,"So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,"
Ephesians,4,18,"being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;"
Ephesians,4,19,"and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness."
Ephesians,4,20,"But you did not learn Christ in this way,"
Ephesians,4,21,"if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,"
Ephesians,4,22,"that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,"
Ephesians,4,23,"and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
Ephesians,4,24,"and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."
Ephesians,4,25,"Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another."
Ephesians,4,26,"BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,"
Ephesians,4,27,and do not give the devil an opportunity.
Ephesians,4,28,"He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need."
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear."
Ephesians,4,30,"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice."
Ephesians,4,32,"Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;"
Ephesians,5,2,"and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."
Ephesians,5,3,"But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;"
Ephesians,5,4,"and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."
Ephesians,5,7,Therefore do not be partakers with them;
Ephesians,5,8,"for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light"
Ephesians,5,9,"(for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),"
Ephesians,5,10,trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;"
Ephesians,5,12,for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,"But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light."
Ephesians,5,14,"For this reason it says, “Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.”"
Ephesians,5,15,"Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,"
Ephesians,5,16,"making the most of your time, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
Ephesians,5,18,"And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,"
Ephesians,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;"
Ephesians,5,20,"always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;"
Ephesians,5,21,and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body."
Ephesians,5,24,"But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,"
Ephesians,5,26,"so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,"
Ephesians,5,27,"that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless."
Ephesians,5,28,So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;
Ephesians,5,29,"for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,"
Ephesians,5,30,because we are members of His body.
Ephesians,5,31,"FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH."
Ephesians,5,32,This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
Ephesians,5,33,"Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,"HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),"
Ephesians,6,3,"SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH."
Ephesians,6,4,"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;"
Ephesians,6,6,"not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart."
Ephesians,6,7,"With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,"
Ephesians,6,8,"knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil."
Ephesians,6,12,"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."
Ephesians,6,13,"Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,"
Ephesians,6,15,and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE;
Ephesians,6,16,"in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
Ephesians,6,17,"And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
Ephesians,6,18,"With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,"
Ephesians,6,19,"and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,"
Ephesians,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
Ephesians,6,21,"But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you."
Ephesians,6,22,"I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.
Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons:"
Philippians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,3,"I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,"
Philippians,1,4,"always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,"
Philippians,1,5,in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.
Philippians,1,6,"For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,1,7,"For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me."
Philippians,1,8,"For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,"
Philippians,1,10,"so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;"
Philippians,1,11,"having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God."
Philippians,1,12,"Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,"
Philippians,1,13,"so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,"
Philippians,1,14,"and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear."
Philippians,1,15,"Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will;"
Philippians,1,16,"the latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;"
Philippians,1,17,"the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment."
Philippians,1,18,"What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,"
Philippians,1,19,"for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
Philippians,1,20,"according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
Philippians,1,21,"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
Philippians,1,22,"But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose."
Philippians,1,23,"But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better;"
Philippians,1,24,yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
Philippians,1,25,"Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,"
Philippians,1,26,so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
Philippians,1,27,"Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
Philippians,1,28,"in no way alarmed by your opponents—which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that too, from God."
Philippians,1,29,"For to you it has been granted for Christ’s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,"
Philippians,1,30,"experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
Philippians,2,1,"Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,"
Philippians,2,2,"make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose."
Philippians,2,3,"Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves;"
Philippians,2,4,"do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others."
Philippians,2,5,"Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,"
Philippians,2,6,"who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,"
Philippians,2,7,"but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men."
Philippians,2,8,"Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."
Philippians,2,9,"For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,"
Philippians,2,10,"so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,"
Philippians,2,11,"and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
Philippians,2,12,"So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;"
Philippians,2,13,"for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
Philippians,2,14,Do all things without grumbling or disputing;
Philippians,2,15,"so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,"
Philippians,2,16,"holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain."
Philippians,2,17,"But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all."
Philippians,2,18,"You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
Philippians,2,19,"But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition."
Philippians,2,20,For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.
Philippians,2,21,"For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,2,22,"But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father."
Philippians,2,23,"Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;"
Philippians,2,24,and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.
Philippians,2,25,"But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;"
Philippians,2,26,because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
Philippians,2,27,"For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow."
Philippians,2,28,Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
Philippians,2,29,"Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard;"
Philippians,2,30,"because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you."
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision;"
Philippians,3,3,"for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,"
Philippians,3,4,"although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more:"
Philippians,3,5,"circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;"
Philippians,3,6,"as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless."
Philippians,3,7,"But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ,"
Philippians,3,9,"and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,"
Philippians,3,10,"that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;"
Philippians,3,11,in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,"
Philippians,3,14,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you;"
Philippians,3,16,"however, let us keep living by that same standard to which we have attained."
Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us."
Philippians,3,18,"For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,"
Philippians,3,19,"whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things."
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;"
Philippians,3,21,"who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long to see, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved."
Philippians,4,2,I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.
Philippians,4,3,"Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!"
Philippians,4,5,Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Philippians,4,6,"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."
Philippians,4,7,"And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things."
Philippians,4,9,"The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you."
Philippians,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity."
Philippians,4,11,"Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am."
Philippians,4,12,"I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need."
Philippians,4,13,I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.
Philippians,4,14,"Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction."
Philippians,4,15,"You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone;"
Philippians,4,16,for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs.
Philippians,4,17,"Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account."
Philippians,4,18,"But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God."
Philippians,4,19,And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,20,Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
Philippians,4,22,"All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household."
Philippians,4,23,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Colossians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
Colossians,1,2,To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
Colossians,1,3,"We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
Colossians,1,4,since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;
Colossians,1,5,"because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel"
Colossians,1,6,"which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth;"
Colossians,1,7,"just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,"
Colossians,1,8,and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
Colossians,1,9,"For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,"
Colossians,1,10,"so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
Colossians,1,11,"strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously"
Colossians,1,12,"giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light."
Colossians,1,13,"For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,"
Colossians,1,14,"in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
Colossians,1,15,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation."
Colossians,1,16,"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him."
Colossians,1,17,"He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together."
Colossians,1,18,"He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything."
Colossians,1,19,"For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,"
Colossians,1,20,"and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven."
Colossians,1,21,"And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds,"
Colossians,1,22,"yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach—"
Colossians,1,23,"if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister."
Colossians,1,24,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions."
Colossians,1,25,"Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God,"
Colossians,1,26,"that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints,"
Colossians,1,27,"to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
Colossians,1,28,"We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ."
Colossians,1,29,"For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me."
Colossians,2,1,"For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,"
Colossians,2,2,"that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God’s mystery, that is, Christ Himself,"
Colossians,2,3,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians,2,4,I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument.
Colossians,2,5,"For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ."
Colossians,2,6,"Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,"
Colossians,2,7,"having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude."
Colossians,2,8,"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ."
Colossians,2,9,"For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,"
Colossians,2,10,"and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;"
Colossians,2,11,"and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;"
Colossians,2,12,"having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead."
Colossians,2,13,"When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions,"
Colossians,2,14,"having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross."
Colossians,2,15,"When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him."
Colossians,2,16,Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day—
Colossians,2,17,things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.
Colossians,2,18,"Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,"
Colossians,2,19,"and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God."
Colossians,2,20,"If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,"
Colossians,2,21,"“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”"
Colossians,2,22,(which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?
Colossians,2,23,"These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence."
Colossians,3,1,"Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."
Colossians,3,2,"Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth."
Colossians,3,3,For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
Colossians,3,4,"When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry."
Colossians,3,6,"For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience,"
Colossians,3,7,"and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them."
Colossians,3,8,"But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech from your mouth."
Colossians,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices,"
Colossians,3,10,and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him—
Colossians,3,11,"a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all."
Colossians,3,12,"So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;"
Colossians,3,13,"bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you."
Colossians,3,14,"Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity."
Colossians,3,15,"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful."
Colossians,3,16,"Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God."
Colossians,3,17,"Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father."
Colossians,3,18,"Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
Colossians,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them."
Colossians,3,20,"Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord."
Colossians,3,21,"Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart."
Colossians,3,22,"Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord."
Colossians,3,23,"Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men,"
Colossians,3,24,knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.
Colossians,3,25,"For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality."
Colossians,4,1,"Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven."
Colossians,4,2,"Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving;"
Colossians,4,3,"praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;"
Colossians,4,4,that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
Colossians,4,5,"Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity."
Colossians,4,6,"Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person."
Colossians,4,7,"As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information."
Colossians,4,8,"For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;"
Colossians,4,9,"and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your number. They will inform you about the whole situation here."
Colossians,4,10,"Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas’s cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him);"
Colossians,4,11,"and also Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me."
Colossians,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God."
Colossians,4,13,For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
Colossians,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and also Demas."
Colossians,4,15,Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house.
Colossians,4,16,"When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea."
Colossians,4,17,"Say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.”"
Colossians,4,18,"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you."
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers;"
1 Thessalonians,1,3,"constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,"
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;"
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake."
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,"
1 Thessalonians,1,7,so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything."
1 Thessalonians,1,9,"For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,"
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain,"
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit;
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—God is witness—"
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children."
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,"You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers;"
1 Thessalonians,2,11,"just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his own children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,12,so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews,"
1 Thessalonians,2,15,"who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men,"
1 Thessalonians,2,16,hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short while—in person, not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see your face."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and yet Satan hindered us."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,For you are our glory and joy.
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Therefore when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone,"
1 Thessalonians,3,2,"and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,"
1 Thessalonians,3,3,so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"For indeed when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you,"
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;"
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"for now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account,"
1 Thessalonians,3,10,"as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?"
1 Thessalonians,3,11,Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you;
1 Thessalonians,3,12,"and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you;"
1 Thessalonians,3,13,so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us instruction as to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you excel still more."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,For you know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,"For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality;"
1 Thessalonians,4,4,"that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,"
1 Thessalonians,4,5,"not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God;"
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"and that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,"For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification."
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"So, he who rejects this is not rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,"Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;"
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"for indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more,"
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you,"
1 Thessalonians,4,12,so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."
1 Thessalonians,4,17,"Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape."
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief;"
1 Thessalonians,5,5,for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,"For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night."
1 Thessalonians,5,8,"But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation."
1 Thessalonians,5,9,"For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction,"
1 Thessalonians,5,13,and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Rejoice always;
1 Thessalonians,5,17,pray without ceasing;
1 Thessalonians,5,18,in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Do not quench the Spirit;
1 Thessalonians,5,20,do not despise prophetic utterances.
1 Thessalonians,5,21,But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good;
1 Thessalonians,5,22,abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater;"
2 Thessalonians,1,4,"therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure."
2 Thessalonians,1,5,"This is a plain indication of God’s righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering."
2 Thessalonians,1,6,"For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,"
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire,"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
2 Thessalonians,1,9,"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed—for our testimony to you was believed."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power,"
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,"
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,"Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?"
2 Thessalonians,2,6,"And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed."
2 Thessalonians,2,7,For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians,2,8,Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false,"
2 Thessalonians,2,12,"in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness."
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth."
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it did also with you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not all have faith.
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"not because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope,"
1 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,"
1 Timothy,1,4,"nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith."
1 Timothy,1,5,But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
1 Timothy,1,6,"For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion,"
1 Timothy,1,7,"wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,"
1 Timothy,1,9,"realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers"
1 Timothy,1,10,"and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,"
1 Timothy,1,11,"according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted."
1 Timothy,1,12,"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service,"
1 Timothy,1,13,even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;
1 Timothy,1,14,"and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,1,15,"It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all."
1 Timothy,1,16,"Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight,"
1 Timothy,1,19,"keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith."
1 Timothy,1,20,"Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,"
1 Timothy,2,2,"for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity."
1 Timothy,2,3,"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,"
1 Timothy,2,4,who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,"
1 Timothy,2,6,"who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time."
1 Timothy,2,7,"For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension."
1 Timothy,2,9,"Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,"
1 Timothy,2,10,"but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness."
1 Timothy,2,11,A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.
1 Timothy,2,12,"But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,"And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression."
1 Timothy,2,15,But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
1 Timothy,3,1,"It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do."
1 Timothy,3,2,"An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,"
1 Timothy,3,3,"not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money."
1 Timothy,3,4,"He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity"
1 Timothy,3,5,"(but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),"
1 Timothy,3,6,"and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain,"
1 Timothy,3,9,but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.
1 Timothy,3,11,"Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households."
1 Timothy,3,13,For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,"I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long;"
1 Timothy,3,15,"but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,"
1 Timothy,4,2,"by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,"
1 Timothy,4,3,men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy,4,4,"For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;"
1 Timothy,4,5,for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following."
1 Timothy,4,7,"But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness;"
1 Timothy,4,8,"for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance.
1 Timothy,4,10,"For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers."
1 Timothy,4,11,Prescribe and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all."
1 Timothy,4,16,"Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father, to the younger men as brothers,"
1 Timothy,5,2,"the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, in all purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Honor widows who are widows indeed;
1 Timothy,5,4,"but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God."
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day."
1 Timothy,5,6,But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,"
1 Timothy,5,10,"having a reputation for good works; and if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has assisted those in distress, and if she has devoted herself to every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married,"
1 Timothy,5,12,"thus incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge."
1 Timothy,5,13,"At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention."
1 Timothy,5,14,"Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, bear children, keep house, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach;"
1 Timothy,5,15,for some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed."
1 Timothy,5,17,"The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the Scripture says, “YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,” and “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”"
1 Timothy,5,19,Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy,5,20,"Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful of sinning."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias, doing nothing in a spirit of partiality."
1 Timothy,5,22,Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.
1 Timothy,5,23,"No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments."
1 Timothy,5,24,"The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins follow after."
1 Timothy,5,25,"Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed."
1 Timothy,6,1,All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.
1 Timothy,6,2,"Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these principles."
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness,"
1 Timothy,6,4,"he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,"
1 Timothy,6,5,"and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain."
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either."
1 Timothy,6,8,"If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content."
1 Timothy,6,9,But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."
1 Timothy,6,13,"I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,"
1 Timothy,6,14,"that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Timothy,6,15,"which He will bring about at the proper time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"
1 Timothy,6,16,"who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy."
1 Timothy,6,18,"Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,"
1 Timothy,6,19,"storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed."
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called “knowledge”—"
1 Timothy,6,21,which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you.
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,"
2 Timothy,1,4,"longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy."
2 Timothy,1,5,"For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well."
2 Timothy,1,6,For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,"
2 Timothy,1,9,"who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,"
2 Timothy,1,10,"but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,"
2 Timothy,1,11,for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.
2 Timothy,1,12,"For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,"Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you."
2 Timothy,1,15,"You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;"
2 Timothy,1,17,"but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me—"
2 Timothy,1,18,the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
2 Timothy,2,3,"Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,4,"No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier."
2 Timothy,2,5,"Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules."
2 Timothy,2,6,The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.
2 Timothy,2,7,"Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,"
2 Timothy,2,9,for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.
2 Timothy,2,10,"For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;"
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;"
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,"
2 Timothy,2,17,"and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,"
2 Timothy,2,18,"men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,"Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor."
2 Timothy,2,21,"Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels."
2 Timothy,2,24,"The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,"
2 Timothy,2,25,"with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,"
2 Timothy,2,26,"and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come."
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,"
2 Timothy,3,4,"treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,"
2 Timothy,3,5,"holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these."
2 Timothy,3,6,"For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,"
2 Timothy,3,7,always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes’s and Jambres’s folly was also."
2 Timothy,3,10,"Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,"
2 Timothy,3,11,"persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!"
2 Timothy,3,12,"Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
2 Timothy,3,13,"But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,"
2 Timothy,3,15,and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,3,16,"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;"
2 Timothy,3,17,"so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:"
2 Timothy,4,2,"preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,"
2 Timothy,4,4,and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.
2 Timothy,4,5,"But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come."
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;"
2 Timothy,4,8,"in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,Make every effort to come to me soon;
2 Timothy,4,10,"for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service."
2 Timothy,4,12,But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
2 Timothy,4,15,"Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching."
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth."
2 Timothy,4,18,"The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
2 Timothy,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus."
2 Timothy,4,21,"Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
Titus,1,1,"Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,"
Titus,1,2,"in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,"
Titus,1,3,"but at the proper time manifested, even His word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,"
Titus,1,4,"To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior."
Titus,1,5,"For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,"
Titus,1,6,"namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion."
Titus,1,7,"For the overseer must be above reproach as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain,"
Titus,1,8,"but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled,"
Titus,1,9,"holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict."
Titus,1,10,"For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,"
Titus,1,11,"who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not teach for the sake of sordid gain."
Titus,1,12,"One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”"
Titus,1,13,"This testimony is true. For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith,"
Titus,1,14,not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus,1,15,"To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled."
Titus,1,16,"They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed."
Titus,2,1,"But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine."
Titus,2,2,"Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance."
Titus,2,3,"Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,"
Titus,2,4,"so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,"
Titus,2,5,"to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored."
Titus,2,6,Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;
Titus,2,7,"in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,"
Titus,2,8,"sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us."
Titus,2,9,"Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,"
Titus,2,10,"not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,"
Titus,2,12,"instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,"
Titus,2,13,"looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,"
Titus,2,14,"who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds."
Titus,2,15,These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
Titus,3,1,"Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,"
Titus,3,2,"to malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men."
Titus,3,3,"For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another."
Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,"
Titus,3,6,"whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
Titus,3,7,so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus,3,8,"This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless."
Titus,3,10,"Reject a factious man after a first and second warning,"
Titus,3,11,"knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned."
Titus,3,12,"When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there."
Titus,3,13,Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.
Titus,3,14,"Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Philemon,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,"
Philemon,1,2,"and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:"
Philemon,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon,1,4,"I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,"
Philemon,1,5,because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;
Philemon,1,6,and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ’s sake.
Philemon,1,7,"For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother."
Philemon,1,8,"Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,"
Philemon,1,9,"yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you—since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—"
Philemon,1,10,"I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,"
Philemon,1,11,"who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me."
Philemon,1,12,"I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart,"
Philemon,1,13,"whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;"
Philemon,1,14,"but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will."
Philemon,1,15,"For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever,"
Philemon,1,16,"no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
Philemon,1,17,"If then you regard me a partner, accept him as you would me."
Philemon,1,18,"But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;"
Philemon,1,19,"I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well)."
Philemon,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ."
Philemon,1,21,"Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say."
Philemon,1,22,"At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you."
Philemon,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,"
Philemon,1,24,"as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers."
Philemon,1,25,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Hebrews,1,1,"God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,"
Hebrews,1,2,"in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world."
Hebrews,1,3,"And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
Hebrews,1,4,"having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did He ever say, “YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU”? And again, “I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME”?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, “AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.”"
Hebrews,1,7,"And of the angels He says, “WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS, AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE.”"
Hebrews,1,8,"But of the Son He says, “YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM."
Hebrews,1,9,"“YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS.”"
Hebrews,1,10,"And, “YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;"
Hebrews,1,11,"THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN; AND THEY ALL WILL BECOME OLD LIKE A GARMENT,"
Hebrews,1,12,"AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END.”"
Hebrews,1,13,"But to which of the angels has He ever said, “SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?"
Hebrews,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it."
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,"
Hebrews,2,3,"how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,"
Hebrews,2,4,"God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will."
Hebrews,2,5,"For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking."
Hebrews,2,6,"But one has testified somewhere, saying, “WHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM? OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?"
Hebrews,2,7,"“YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;"
Hebrews,2,8,"YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET.” For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings."
Hebrews,2,11,"For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
Hebrews,2,12,"saying, “I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”"
Hebrews,2,13,"And again, “I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM.” And again, “BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME.”"
Hebrews,2,14,"Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,"
Hebrews,2,15,and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
Hebrews,2,16,"For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham."
Hebrews,2,17,"Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;"
Hebrews,3,2,"He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house."
Hebrews,3,3,"For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God."
Hebrews,3,5,"Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;"
Hebrews,3,6,"but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end."
Hebrews,3,7,"Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, “TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,"
Hebrews,3,8,"DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,"
Hebrews,3,9,"WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED Me BY TESTING Me, AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS."
Hebrews,3,10,"“THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION, AND SAID, ‘THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART, AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS’;"
Hebrews,3,11,"AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, ‘THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.’”"
Hebrews,3,12,"Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God."
Hebrews,3,13,"But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
Hebrews,3,14,"For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,"
Hebrews,3,15,"while it is said, “TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.”"
Hebrews,3,16,"For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?"
Hebrews,3,17,"And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?"
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
Hebrews,4,1,"Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, “AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,” although His works were finished from the foundation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: “AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS”;
Hebrews,4,5,"and again in this passage, “THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.”"
Hebrews,4,6,"Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,"
Hebrews,4,7,"He again fixes a certain day, “Today,” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, “TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS.”"
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that."
Hebrews,4,9,So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews,4,10,"For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His."
Hebrews,4,11,"Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do."
Hebrews,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;"
Hebrews,5,2,"he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness;"
Hebrews,5,3,"and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself."
Hebrews,5,4,"And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, “YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU”;"
Hebrews,5,6,"just as He says also in another passage, “YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.”"
Hebrews,5,7,"In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety."
Hebrews,5,8,"Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered."
Hebrews,5,9,"And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,"
Hebrews,5,10,being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,11,"Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,"For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant."
Hebrews,5,14,"But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,"
Hebrews,6,2,"of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,"And this we will do, if God permits."
Hebrews,6,4,"For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,"
Hebrews,6,5,"and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,"
Hebrews,6,6,"and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame."
Hebrews,6,7,"For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;"
Hebrews,6,8,"but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way."
Hebrews,6,10,"For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints."
Hebrews,6,11,"And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,"
Hebrews,6,12,"so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,"
Hebrews,6,14,"saying, “I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU.”"
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,"For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute."
Hebrews,6,17,"In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,"
Hebrews,6,18,"so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us."
Hebrews,6,19,"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,"
Hebrews,6,20,"where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,"
Hebrews,7,2,"to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace."
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils."
Hebrews,7,5,"And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham."
Hebrews,7,6,But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
Hebrews,7,7,But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Hebrews,7,8,"In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on."
Hebrews,7,9,"And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,"
Hebrews,7,10,for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews,7,11,"Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also."
Hebrews,7,13,"For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests."
Hebrews,7,15,"And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,"
Hebrews,7,16,"who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life."
Hebrews,7,17,"For it is attested of Him, “YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.”"
Hebrews,7,18,"For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness"
Hebrews,7,19,"(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God."
Hebrews,7,20,And inasmuch as it was not without an oath
Hebrews,7,21,"(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, “THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, ‘YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER’”);"
Hebrews,7,22,so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
Hebrews,7,23,"The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,"
Hebrews,7,24,"but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently."
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;"
Hebrews,7,27,"who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,"
Hebrews,8,2,"a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man."
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;"
Hebrews,8,5,"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, “SEE,” He says, “THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.”"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, He says, “BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL EFFECT A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH;"
Hebrews,8,9,"NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT, AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD."
Hebrews,8,10,"“FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS, AND I WILL WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE."
Hebrews,8,11,"“AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EVERYONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN, AND EVERYONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, ‘KNOW THE LORD,’ FOR ALL WILL KNOW ME, FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM."
Hebrews,8,12,"“FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES, AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE.”"
Hebrews,8,13,"When He said, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear."
Hebrews,9,1,Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place."
Hebrews,9,3,"Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,"
Hebrews,9,4,"having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
Hebrews,9,5,and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,"
Hebrews,9,7,"but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance."
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,"
Hebrews,9,9,"which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,"
Hebrews,9,10,"since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation."
Hebrews,9,11,"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;"
Hebrews,9,12,"and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,"
Hebrews,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance."
Hebrews,9,16,"For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it."
Hebrews,9,17,"For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives."
Hebrews,9,18,Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,"
Hebrews,9,20,"saying, “THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU.”"
Hebrews,9,21,And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.
Hebrews,9,22,"And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
Hebrews,9,23,"Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;"
Hebrews,9,25,"nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own."
Hebrews,9,26,"Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."
Hebrews,9,27,"And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,"
Hebrews,9,28,"so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him."
Hebrews,10,1,"For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near."
Hebrews,10,2,"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?"
Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.
Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, “SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME;"
Hebrews,10,6,IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE.
Hebrews,10,7,"“THEN I SAID, ‘BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.’”"
Hebrews,10,8,"After saying above, “SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them” (which are offered according to the Law),"
Hebrews,10,9,"then He said, “BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews,10,11,"Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;"
Hebrews,10,12,"but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,"
Hebrews,10,13,waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15,"And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,"
Hebrews,10,16,"“THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,” He then says,"
Hebrews,10,17,“AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.”
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin."
Hebrews,10,19,"Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,"
Hebrews,10,20,"by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,"
Hebrews,10,21,"and since we have a great priest over the house of God,"
Hebrews,10,22,"let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;"
Hebrews,10,24,"and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,"
Hebrews,10,25,"not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near."
Hebrews,10,26,"For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,"
Hebrews,10,27,but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.
Hebrews,10,28,Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews,10,29,"How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know Him who said, “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.” And again, “THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.”"
Hebrews,10,31,It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,"But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,"
Hebrews,10,33,"partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated."
Hebrews,10,34,"For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one."
Hebrews,10,35,"Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward."
Hebrews,10,36,"For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised."
Hebrews,10,37,"FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE, HE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY."
Hebrews,10,38,"BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH; AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM."
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul."
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the men of old gained approval.
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks."
Hebrews,11,5,By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.
Hebrews,11,6,"And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going."
Hebrews,11,9,"By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;"
Hebrews,11,10,"for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God."
Hebrews,11,11,"By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised."
Hebrews,11,12,"Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN IN NUMBER, AND INNUMERABLE AS THE SAND WHICH IS BY THE SEASHORE."
Hebrews,11,13,"All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth."
Hebrews,11,14,For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
Hebrews,11,15,"And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return."
Hebrews,11,16,"But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;"
Hebrews,11,18,"it was he to whom it was said, “IN ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED.”"
Hebrews,11,19,"He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type."
Hebrews,11,20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come."
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff."
Hebrews,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones."
Hebrews,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict."
Hebrews,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,"
Hebrews,11,25,"choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,"
Hebrews,11,26,considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.
Hebrews,11,27,"By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen."
Hebrews,11,28,"By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them."
Hebrews,11,29,"By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned."
Hebrews,11,30,By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
Hebrews,11,31,"By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace."
Hebrews,11,32,"And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,"
Hebrews,11,33,"who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,"
Hebrews,11,34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection;"
Hebrews,11,36,"and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment."
Hebrews,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated"
Hebrews,11,38,"(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground."
Hebrews,11,39,"And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,"
Hebrews,11,40,"because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect."
Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,"
Hebrews,12,2,"fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."
Hebrews,12,4,You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;
Hebrews,12,5,"and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, “MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;"
Hebrews,12,6,"FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.”"
Hebrews,12,7,It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
Hebrews,12,8,"But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons."
Hebrews,12,9,"Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?"
Hebrews,12,10,"For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness."
Hebrews,12,11,"All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness."
Hebrews,12,12,"Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,"
Hebrews,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed."
Hebrews,12,14,"Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord."
Hebrews,12,15,"See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;"
Hebrews,12,16,"that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal."
Hebrews,12,17,"For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears."
Hebrews,12,18,"For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,"
Hebrews,12,19,and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
Hebrews,12,20,"For they could not bear the command, “IF EVEN A BEAST TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN, IT WILL BE STONED.”"
Hebrews,12,21,"And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, “I AM FULL OF FEAR and trembling.”"
Hebrews,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,"
Hebrews,12,23,"to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,"
Hebrews,12,24,"and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven."
Hebrews,12,26,"And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, “YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH, BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN.”"
Hebrews,12,27,"This expression, “Yet once more,” denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."
Hebrews,12,28,"Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;"
Hebrews,12,29,for our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews,13,1,Let love of the brethren continue.
Hebrews,13,2,"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it."
Hebrews,13,3,"Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body."
Hebrews,13,4,"Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge."
Hebrews,13,5,"Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, “I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,”"
Hebrews,13,6,"so that we confidently say, “THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO ME?”"
Hebrews,13,7,"Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith."
Hebrews,13,8,Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Hebrews,13,9,"Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited."
Hebrews,13,10,We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews,13,11,"For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp."
Hebrews,13,12,"Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate."
Hebrews,13,13,"So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach."
Hebrews,13,14,"For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come."
Hebrews,13,15,"Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name."
Hebrews,13,16,"And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."
Hebrews,13,17,"Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you."
Hebrews,13,18,"Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things."
Hebrews,13,19,"And I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner."
Hebrews,13,20,"Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord,"
Hebrews,13,21,"equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
Hebrews,13,22,"But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly."
Hebrews,13,23,"Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you."
Hebrews,13,24,Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
Hebrews,13,25,Grace be with you all.
James,1,1,"James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings."
James,1,2,"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,"
James,1,3,knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
James,1,4,"And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."
James,1,5,"But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
James,1,6,"But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind."
James,1,7,"For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,"
James,1,8,"being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
James,1,9,But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;
James,1,10,"and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away."
James,1,11,For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.
James,1,12,"Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him."
James,1,13,"Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone."
James,1,14,But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
James,1,15,"Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death."
James,1,16,"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren."
James,1,17,"Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow."
James,1,18,"In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures."
James,1,19,"This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;"
James,1,20,for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
James,1,21,"Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls."
James,1,22,"But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves."
James,1,23,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;"
James,1,24,"for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was."
James,1,25,"But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does."
James,1,26,"If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion is worthless."
James,1,27,"Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
James,2,1,"My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism."
James,2,2,"For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes,"
James,2,3,"and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,”"
James,2,4,"have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?"
James,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?"
James,2,6,But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?
James,2,7,Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?
James,2,8,"If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF,” you are doing well."
James,2,9,"But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
James,2,10,"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all."
James,2,11,"For He who said, “DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,” also said, “DO NOT COMMIT MURDER.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
James,2,12,So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
James,2,13,For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
James,2,14,"What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?"
James,2,15,"If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,"
James,2,16,"and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?"
James,2,17,"Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself."
James,2,18,"But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.”"
James,2,19,"You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder."
James,2,20,"But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?"
James,2,21,Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
James,2,22,"You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;"
James,2,23,"and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,” and he was called the friend of God."
James,2,24,You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
James,2,25,"In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?"
James,2,26,"For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
James,3,1,"Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment."
James,3,2,"For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well."
James,3,3,"Now if we put the bits into the horses’ mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well."
James,3,4,"Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires."
James,3,5,"So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!"
James,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell."
James,3,7,"For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race."
James,3,8,But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.
James,3,9,"With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;"
James,3,10,"from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way."
James,3,11,Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
James,3,12,"Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh."
James,3,13,Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.
James,3,14,"But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth."
James,3,15,"This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic."
James,3,16,"For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy."
James,3,18,And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
James,4,1,What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?
James,4,2,You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.
James,4,3,"You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures."
James,4,4,"You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God."
James,4,5,Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: “He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us”?
James,4,6,"But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, “GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.”"
James,4,7,Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
James,4,8,"Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
James,4,9,Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you."
James,4,11,"Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it."
James,4,12,"There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?"
James,4,13,"Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.”"
James,4,14,Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
James,4,15,"Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.”"
James,4,16,"But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil."
James,4,17,"Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin."
James,5,1,"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you."
James,5,2,Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.
James,5,3,Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!
James,5,4,"Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth."
James,5,5,You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
James,5,6,You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you.
James,5,7,"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains."
James,5,8,"You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near."
James,5,9,"Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door."
James,5,10,"As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."
James,5,11,"We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord’s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful."
James,5,12,"But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment."
James,5,13,Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises.
James,5,14,"Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;"
James,5,15,"and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him."
James,5,16,"Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much."
James,5,17,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months."
James,5,18,"Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit."
James,5,19,"My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,"
James,5,20,let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen"
1 Peter,1,2,"according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure."
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
1 Peter,1,4,"to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,"
1 Peter,1,5,who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,"
1 Peter,1,7,"so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
1 Peter,1,8,"and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,"
1 Peter,1,9,obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.
1 Peter,1,10,"As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries,"
1 Peter,1,11,seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
1 Peter,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look."
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,1,14,"As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,"
1 Peter,1,15,"but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior;"
1 Peter,1,16,"because it is written, “YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.”"
1 Peter,1,17,"If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth;"
1 Peter,1,18,"knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,"
1 Peter,1,19,"but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ."
1 Peter,1,20,"For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you"
1 Peter,1,21,"who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,"
1 Peter,1,23,"for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God."
1 Peter,1,24,"For, “ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF,"
1 Peter,1,25,BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.” And this is the word which was preached to you.
1 Peter,2,1,"Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,"
1 Peter,2,2,"like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,"
1 Peter,2,3,if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
1 Peter,2,4,"And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,"
1 Peter,2,5,"you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"For this is contained in Scripture: “BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.”"
1 Peter,2,7,"This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, “THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,”"
1 Peter,2,8,"and, “A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE”; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;"
1 Peter,2,10,"for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul."
1 Peter,2,12,"Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation."
1 Peter,2,13,"Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,"
1 Peter,2,14,or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.
1 Peter,2,15,For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
1 Peter,2,16,"Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God."
1 Peter,2,17,"Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king."
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable."
1 Peter,2,19,"For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly."
1 Peter,2,20,"For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God."
1 Peter,2,21,"For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,"
1 Peter,2,22,"WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;"
1 Peter,2,23,"and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously;"
1 Peter,2,24,"and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."
1 Peter,2,25,"For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives,"
1 Peter,3,2,as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.
1 Peter,3,3,"Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;"
1 Peter,3,4,"but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God."
1 Peter,3,5,"For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;"
1 Peter,3,6,"just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear."
1 Peter,3,7,"You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered."
1 Peter,3,8,"To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit;"
1 Peter,3,9,"not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For, “THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT."
1 Peter,3,11,“HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT.
1 Peter,3,12,"“FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.”"
1 Peter,3,13,Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
1 Peter,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,"
1 Peter,3,15,"but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;"
1 Peter,3,16,"and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame."
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;"
1 Peter,3,19,"in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison,"
1 Peter,3,20,"who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water."
1 Peter,3,21,"Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
1 Peter,3,22,"who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,"
1 Peter,4,2,"so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God."
1 Peter,4,3,"For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries."
1 Peter,4,4,"In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you;"
1 Peter,4,5,but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God."
1 Peter,4,7,"The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
1 Peter,4,8,"Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins."
1 Peter,4,9,Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
1 Peter,4,10,"As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
1 Peter,4,11,"Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you;"
1 Peter,4,13,"but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you."
1 Peter,4,15,"Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;"
1 Peter,4,16,"but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name."
1 Peter,4,17,"For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
1 Peter,4,18,"AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER?"
1 Peter,4,19,"Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right."
1 Peter,5,1,"Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed,"
1 Peter,5,2,"shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;"
1 Peter,5,3,"nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
1 Peter,5,5,"You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE."
1 Peter,5,6,"Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,"
1 Peter,5,7,"casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you."
1 Peter,5,8,"Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
1 Peter,5,9,"But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world."
1 Peter,5,10,"After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you."
1 Peter,5,11,To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!"
1 Peter,5,13,"She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark."
1 Peter,5,14,Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.
2 Peter,1,1,"Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:"
2 Peter,1,2,Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
2 Peter,1,3,"seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence."
2 Peter,1,4,"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust."
2 Peter,1,5,"Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge,"
2 Peter,1,6,"and in your knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness,"
2 Peter,1,7,"and in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, love."
2 Peter,1,8,"For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,9,"For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins."
2 Peter,1,10,"Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble;"
2 Peter,1,11,for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
2 Peter,1,12,"Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you already know them, and have been established in the truth which is present with you."
2 Peter,1,13,"I consider it right, as long as I am in this earthly dwelling, to stir you up by way of reminder,"
2 Peter,1,14,"knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me."
2 Peter,1,15,And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these things to mind.
2 Peter,1,16,"For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty."
2 Peter,1,17,"For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, “This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased”—"
2 Peter,1,18,and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
2 Peter,1,19,"So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts."
2 Peter,1,20,"But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation,"
2 Peter,1,21,"for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."
2 Peter,2,1,"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves."
2 Peter,2,2,"Many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned;"
2 Peter,2,3,"and in their greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;"
2 Peter,2,5,"and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,6,"and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter;"
2 Peter,2,7,"and if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men"
2 Peter,2,8,"(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),"
2 Peter,2,9,"then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,"
2 Peter,2,10,"and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties,"
2 Peter,2,11,whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed,"
2 Peter,2,13,"suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you,"
2 Peter,2,14,"having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children;"
2 Peter,2,15,"forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
2 Peter,2,16,"but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, for a mute donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet."
2 Peter,2,17,"These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved."
2 Peter,2,18,"For speaking out arrogant words of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error,"
2 Peter,2,19,"promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved."
2 Peter,2,20,"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."
2 Peter,2,21,"For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them."
2 Peter,2,22,"It has happened to them according to the true proverb, “A DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT,” and, “A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mire.”"
2 Peter,3,1,"This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,"
2 Peter,3,2,that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.
2 Peter,3,3,"Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts,"
2 Peter,3,4,"and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation.”"
2 Peter,3,5,"For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water,"
2 Peter,3,6,"through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water."
2 Peter,3,7,"But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
2 Peter,3,8,"But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up."
2 Peter,3,11,"Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,"
2 Peter,3,12,"looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat!"
2 Peter,3,13,"But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells."
2 Peter,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,"
2 Peter,3,15,"and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you,"
2 Peter,3,16,"as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction."
2 Peter,3,17,"You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness,"
2 Peter,3,18,"but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen."
1 John,1,1,"What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life—"
1 John,1,2,"and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us—"
1 John,1,3,"what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,"These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete."
1 John,1,5,"This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all."
1 John,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;"
1 John,1,7,"but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;"
1 John,2,2,"and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world."
1 John,2,3,"By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments."
1 John,2,4,"The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;"
1 John,2,5,"but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him:"
1 John,2,6,the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.
1 John,2,7,"Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard."
1 John,2,8,"On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining."
1 John,2,9,The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
1 John,2,10,The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
1 John,2,11,"But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name’s sake."
1 John,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father."
1 John,2,14,"I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one."
1 John,2,15,"Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
1 John,2,16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world."
1 John,2,17,"The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever."
1 John,2,18,"Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, so that it would be shown that they all are not of us."
1 John,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know."
1 John,2,21,"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth."
1 John,2,22,"Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son."
1 John,2,23,Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.
1 John,2,24,"As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,This is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life.
1 John,2,26,These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you.
1 John,2,27,"As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him."
1 John,2,28,"Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming."
1 John,2,29,"If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him."
1 John,3,1,"See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him."
1 John,3,2,"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is."
1 John,3,3,"And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure."
1 John,3,4,Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
1 John,3,5,You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.
1 John,3,6,No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.
1 John,3,7,"Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous;"
1 John,3,8,"the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil."
1 John,3,9,"No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
1 John,3,10,"By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother."
1 John,3,11,"For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;"
1 John,3,12,"not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you."
1 John,3,14,"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death."
1 John,3,15,Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
1 John,3,16,"We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
1 John,3,17,"But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
1 John,3,18,"Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth."
1 John,3,19,"We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him"
1 John,3,20,in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
1 John,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God;"
1 John,3,22,"and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight."
1 John,3,23,"This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us."
1 John,3,24,"The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us."
1 John,4,1,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God;
1 John,4,3,"and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world."
1 John,4,4,"You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them."
1 John,4,6,We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1 John,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God."
1 John,4,8,"The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
1 John,4,9,"By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him."
1 John,4,10,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us."
1 John,4,13,"By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit."
1 John,4,14,We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
1 John,4,15,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God."
1 John,4,16,"We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him."
1 John,4,17,"By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world."
1 John,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love."
1 John,4,19,"We love, because He first loved us."
1 John,4,20,"If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen."
1 John,4,21,"And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also."
1 John,5,1,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him."
1 John,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments."
1 John,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome."
1 John,5,4,For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
1 John,5,5,"Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
1 John,5,6,"This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth."
1 John,5,7,For there are three that testify:
1 John,5,8,the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
1 John,5,9,"If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son."
1 John,5,10,"The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son."
1 John,5,11,"And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."
1 John,5,12,He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
1 John,5,13,"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life."
1 John,5,14,"This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him."
1 John,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make request for this."
1 John,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death."
1 John,5,18,"We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him."
1 John,5,19,"We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one."
1 John,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Little children, guard yourselves from idols."
2 John,1,1,"The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,"
2 John,1,2,for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:
2 John,1,3,"Grace, mercy and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,"I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father."
2 John,1,5,"Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it."
2 John,1,7,"For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist."
2 John,1,8,"Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,"Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son."
2 John,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting;"
2 John,1,11,for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds.
2 John,1,12,"Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your joy may be made full."
2 John,1,13,The children of your chosen sister greet you.
3 John,1,1,"The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth."
3 John,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers."
3 John,1,3,"For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth."
3 John,1,4,"I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth."
3 John,1,5,"Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers;"
3 John,1,6,and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
3 John,1,7,"For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles."
3 John,1,8,"Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth."
3 John,1,9,"I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say."
3 John,1,10,"For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church."
3 John,1,11,"Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true."
3 John,1,13,"I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink;"
3 John,1,14,"but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face."
Jude,1,1,"Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:"
Jude,1,2,May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
Jude,1,3,"Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints."
Jude,1,4,"For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."
Jude,1,5,"Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe."
Jude,1,6,"And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day,"
Jude,1,7,"just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire."
Jude,1,8,"Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties."
Jude,1,9,"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”"
Jude,1,10,"But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed."
Jude,1,11,"Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah."
Jude,1,12,"These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;"
Jude,1,13,"wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever."
Jude,1,14,"It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones,"
Jude,1,15,"to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”"
Jude,1,16,"These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage."
Jude,1,17,"But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Jude,1,18,"that they were saying to you, “In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts.”"
Jude,1,19,"These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit."
Jude,1,20,"But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,"
Jude,1,21,"keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life."
Jude,1,22,"And have mercy on some, who are doubting;"
Jude,1,23,"save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh."
Jude,1,24,"Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,"
Jude,1,25,"to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen."
Revelation,1,1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John,"
Revelation,1,2,"who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw."
Revelation,1,3,"Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near."
Revelation,1,4,"John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,"
Revelation,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood—"
Revelation,1,6,"and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
Revelation,1,7,"BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen."
Revelation,1,8,"“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”"
Revelation,1,9,"I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus."
Revelation,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet,"
Revelation,1,11,"saying, “Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”"
Revelation,1,12,Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;
Revelation,1,13,"and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash."
Revelation,1,14,"His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire."
Revelation,1,15,"His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters."
Revelation,1,16,"In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength."
Revelation,1,17,"When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,"
Revelation,1,18,"and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades."
Revelation,1,19,"Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things."
Revelation,1,20,"As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
Revelation,2,1,"“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, says this:"
Revelation,2,2,"‘I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false;"
Revelation,2,3,"and you have perseverance and have endured for My name’s sake, and have not grown weary."
Revelation,2,4,"But I have this against you, that you have left your first love."
Revelation,2,5,"Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place—unless you repent."
Revelation,2,6,"Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
Revelation,2,7,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.’"
Revelation,2,8,"“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life, says this:"
Revelation,2,9,"‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
Revelation,2,10,"Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life."
Revelation,2,11,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.’"
Revelation,2,12,“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this:
Revelation,2,13,"‘I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."
Revelation,2,14,"But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality."
Revelation,2,15,So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Revelation,2,16,"Therefore repent; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth."
Revelation,2,17,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.’"
Revelation,2,18,"“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like burnished bronze, says this:"
Revelation,2,19,"‘I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first."
Revelation,2,20,"But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols."
Revelation,2,21,"I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality."
Revelation,2,22,"Behold, I will throw her on a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds."
Revelation,2,23,"And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds."
Revelation,2,24,"But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them—I place no other burden on you."
Revelation,2,25,"Nevertheless what you have, hold fast until I come."
Revelation,2,26,"He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, TO HIM I WILL GIVE AUTHORITY OVER THE NATIONS;"
Revelation,2,27,"AND HE SHALL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON, AS THE VESSELS OF THE POTTER ARE BROKEN TO PIECES, as I also have received authority from My Father;"
Revelation,2,28,and I will give him the morning star.
Revelation,2,29,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’"
Revelation,3,1,"“To the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: ‘I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead."
Revelation,3,2,"Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God."
Revelation,3,3,"So remember what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent. Therefore if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you."
Revelation,3,4,"But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy."
Revelation,3,5,"He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels."
Revelation,3,6,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’"
Revelation,3,7,"“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says this:"
Revelation,3,8,"‘I know your deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut, because you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name."
Revelation,3,9,"Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and make them know that I have loved you."
Revelation,3,10,"Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth."
Revelation,3,11,"I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown."
Revelation,3,12,"He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name."
Revelation,3,13,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’"
Revelation,3,14,"“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, says this:"
Revelation,3,15,"‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot."
Revelation,3,16,"So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth."
Revelation,3,17,"Because you say, “I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,"
Revelation,3,18,"I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see."
Revelation,3,19,"Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent."
Revelation,3,20,"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me."
Revelation,3,21,"He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne."
Revelation,3,22,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”"
Revelation,4,1,"After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.”"
Revelation,4,2,"Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne."
Revelation,4,3,"And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance."
Revelation,4,4,"Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads."
Revelation,4,5,"Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;"
Revelation,4,6,"and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind."
Revelation,4,7,"The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle."
Revelation,4,8,"And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME.”"
Revelation,4,9,"And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,"
Revelation,4,10,"the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,"
Revelation,4,11,"“Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.”"
Revelation,5,1,"I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals."
Revelation,5,2,"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?”"
Revelation,5,3,And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.
Revelation,5,4,Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it;
Revelation,5,5,"and one of the elders *said to me, “Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals.”"
Revelation,5,6,"And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth."
Revelation,5,7,And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,"When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
Revelation,5,9,"And they *sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation."
Revelation,5,10,“You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.”
Revelation,5,11,"Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,"
Revelation,5,12,"saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.”"
Revelation,5,13,"And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, “To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.”"
Revelation,5,14,"And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen.” And the elders fell down and worshiped."
Revelation,6,1,"Then I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, “Come.”"
Revelation,6,2,"I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer."
Revelation,6,3,"When He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come.”"
Revelation,6,4,"And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him."
Revelation,6,5,"When He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come.” I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand."
Revelation,6,6,"And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine.”"
Revelation,6,7,"When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come.”"
Revelation,6,8,"I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth."
Revelation,6,9,"When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;"
Revelation,6,10,"and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”"
Revelation,6,11,"And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also."
Revelation,6,12,"I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;"
Revelation,6,13,"and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind."
Revelation,6,14,"The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
Revelation,6,15,Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;
Revelation,6,16,"and they *said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;"
Revelation,6,17,"for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”"
Revelation,7,1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree."
Revelation,7,2,"And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,"
Revelation,7,3,"saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads.”"
Revelation,7,4,"And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:"
Revelation,7,5,"from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,"
Revelation,7,6,"from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,"
Revelation,7,7,"from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,"
Revelation,7,8,"from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed."
Revelation,7,9,"After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands;"
Revelation,7,10,"and they cry out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”"
Revelation,7,11,"And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,"
Revelation,7,12,"saying, “Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”"
Revelation,7,13,"Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?”"
Revelation,7,14,"I said to him, “My lord, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Revelation,7,15,"For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them."
Revelation,7,16,"They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat;"
Revelation,7,17,"for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”"
Revelation,8,1,"When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
Revelation,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."
Revelation,8,3,"Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand."
Revelation,8,5,"Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake."
Revelation,8,6,And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
Revelation,8,7,"The first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up."
Revelation,8,8,"The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,"
Revelation,8,9,"and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation,8,10,"The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters."
Revelation,8,11,"The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way."
Revelation,8,13,"Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”"
Revelation,9,1,"Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him."
Revelation,9,2,"He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit."
Revelation,9,3,"Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
Revelation,9,4,"They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
Revelation,9,5,"And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man."
Revelation,9,6,"And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them."
Revelation,9,7,"The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men."
Revelation,9,8,"They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions."
Revelation,9,9,"They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle."
Revelation,9,10,"They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months."
Revelation,9,11,"They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,"The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things."
Revelation,9,13,"Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
Revelation,9,14,"one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”"
Revelation,9,15,"And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind."
Revelation,9,16,The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.
Revelation,9,17,And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.
Revelation,9,18,"A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths."
Revelation,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm."
Revelation,9,20,"The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;"
Revelation,9,21,and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.
Revelation,10,1,"I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;"
Revelation,10,2,and he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;
Revelation,10,3,"and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices."
Revelation,10,4,"When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.”"
Revelation,10,5,"Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,"
Revelation,10,6,"and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer,"
Revelation,10,7,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets."
Revelation,10,8,"Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, “Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.”"
Revelation,10,9,"So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he *said to me, “Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”"
Revelation,10,10,"I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter."
Revelation,10,11,"And they *said to me, “You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”"
Revelation,11,1,"Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it."
Revelation,11,2,"Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months."
Revelation,11,3,"And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”"
Revelation,11,4,These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation,11,5,"And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way."
Revelation,11,6,"These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire."
Revelation,11,7,"When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them."
Revelation,11,8,"And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."
Revelation,11,9,"Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb."
Revelation,11,10,"And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth."
Revelation,11,11,"But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them."
Revelation,11,12,"And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them."
Revelation,11,13,"And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."
Revelation,11,14,"The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly."
Revelation,11,15,"Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”"
Revelation,11,16,"And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,"
Revelation,11,17,"saying, “We give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who were, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign."
Revelation,11,18,"And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”"
Revelation,11,19,"And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm."
Revelation,12,1,"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;"
Revelation,12,2,"and she was with child; and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth."
Revelation,12,3,"Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems."
Revelation,12,4,"And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child."
Revelation,12,5,"And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne."
Revelation,12,6,"Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days."
Revelation,12,7,"And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,"
Revelation,12,8,"and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven."
Revelation,12,9,"And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."
Revelation,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night."
Revelation,12,11,"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death."
Revelation,12,12,"For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.”"
Revelation,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child."
Revelation,12,14,"But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent."
Revelation,12,15,"And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood."
Revelation,12,16,"But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth."
Revelation,12,17,"So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus."
Revelation,13,1,"And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names."
Revelation,13,2,"And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority."
Revelation,13,3,"I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast;"
Revelation,13,4,"they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?”"
Revelation,13,5,"There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him."
Revelation,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven."
Revelation,13,7,"It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him."
Revelation,13,8,"All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain."
Revelation,13,9,"If anyone has an ear, let him hear."
Revelation,13,10,"If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints."
Revelation,13,11,Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.
Revelation,13,12,"He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."
Revelation,13,13,"He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men."
Revelation,13,14,"And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life."
Revelation,13,15,"And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
Revelation,13,16,"And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,"
Revelation,13,17,"and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name."
Revelation,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Revelation,14,1,"Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."
Revelation,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps."
Revelation,14,3,And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.
Revelation,14,4,"These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb."
Revelation,14,5,And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.
Revelation,14,6,"And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;"
Revelation,14,7,"and he said with a loud voice, “Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.”"
Revelation,14,8,"And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality.”"
Revelation,14,9,"Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,"
Revelation,14,10,"he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."
Revelation,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”"
Revelation,14,12,Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
Revelation,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!’” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them.”"
Revelation,14,14,"Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand."
Revelation,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, “Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.”"
Revelation,14,16,"Then He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped."
Revelation,14,17,"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle."
Revelation,14,18,"Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.”"
Revelation,14,19,"So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God."
Revelation,14,20,"And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles."
Revelation,15,1,"Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished."
Revelation,15,2,"And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God."
Revelation,15,3,"And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!"
Revelation,15,4,"“Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU, FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED.”"
Revelation,15,5,"After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,"
Revelation,15,6,"and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes."
Revelation,15,7,"Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever."
Revelation,15,8,And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
Revelation,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”"
Revelation,16,2,So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.
Revelation,16,3,"The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died."
Revelation,16,4,Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.
Revelation,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters saying, “Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things;"
Revelation,16,6,"for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.”"
Revelation,16,7,"And I heard the altar saying, “Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.”"
Revelation,16,8,"The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire."
Revelation,16,9,"Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory."
Revelation,16,10,"Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain,"
Revelation,16,11,and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.
Revelation,16,12,"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east."
Revelation,16,13,"And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;"
Revelation,16,14,"for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty."
Revelation,16,15,"(“Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.”)"
Revelation,16,16,And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.
Revelation,16,17,"Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, “It is done.”"
Revelation,16,18,"And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty."
Revelation,16,19,"The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath."
Revelation,16,20,"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
Revelation,16,21,"And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, *came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague *was extremely severe."
Revelation,17,1,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,"
Revelation,17,2,"with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.”"
Revelation,17,3,"And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation,17,4,"The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,"
Revelation,17,5,"and on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, “BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”"
Revelation,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly."
Revelation,17,7,"And the angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns."
Revelation,17,8,"“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come."
Revelation,17,9,"Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,"
Revelation,17,10,"and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while."
Revelation,17,11,"The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction."
Revelation,17,12,"The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour."
Revelation,17,13,"These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast."
Revelation,17,14,"These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.”"
Revelation,17,15,"And he *said to me, “The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues."
Revelation,17,16,"And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire."
Revelation,17,17,"For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled."
Revelation,17,18,"The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.”"
Revelation,18,1,"After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory."
Revelation,18,2,"And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird."
Revelation,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.”"
Revelation,18,4,"I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;"
Revelation,18,5,"for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities."
Revelation,18,6,"Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her."
Revelation,18,7,"To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, ‘I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.’"
Revelation,18,8,"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong."
Revelation,18,9,"“And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,"
Revelation,18,10,"standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’"
Revelation,18,11,"“And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more—"
Revelation,18,12,"cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,"
Revelation,18,13,"and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives."
Revelation,18,14,"The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them."
Revelation,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,"
Revelation,18,16,"saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;"
Revelation,18,17,"for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!’ And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,"
Revelation,18,18,"and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What city is like the great city?’"
Revelation,18,19,"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!’"
Revelation,18,20,"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.”"
Revelation,18,21,"Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer."
Revelation,18,22,And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer;
Revelation,18,23,"and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery."
Revelation,18,24,And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.”
Revelation,19,1,"After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God;"
Revelation,19,2,"BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS BOND-SERVANTS ON HER.”"
Revelation,19,3,"And a second time they said, “Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER.”"
Revelation,19,4,"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!”"
Revelation,19,5,"And a voice came from the throne, saying, “Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and the great.”"
Revelation,19,6,"Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying, “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns."
Revelation,19,7,"Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.”"
Revelation,19,8,"It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints."
Revelation,19,9,"Then he *said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’” And he *said to me, “These are true words of God.”"
Revelation,19,10,"Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he *said to me, “Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”"
Revelation,19,11,"And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war."
Revelation,19,12,"His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself."
Revelation,19,13,"He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God."
Revelation,19,14,"And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses."
Revelation,19,15,"From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty."
Revelation,19,16,"And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”"
Revelation,19,17,"Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God,"
Revelation,19,18,"so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.”"
Revelation,19,19,And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.
Revelation,19,20,"And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone."
Revelation,19,21,"And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh."
Revelation,20,1,"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand."
Revelation,20,2,"And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;"
Revelation,20,3,"and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time."
Revelation,20,4,"Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,5,The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation,20,6,"Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,7,"When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,"
Revelation,20,8,"and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore."
Revelation,20,9,"And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them."
Revelation,20,10,"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
Revelation,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them."
Revelation,20,12,"And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds."
Revelation,20,13,"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds."
Revelation,20,14,"Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire."
Revelation,20,15,"And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."
Revelation,21,1,"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea."
Revelation,21,2,"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband."
Revelation,21,3,"And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,"
Revelation,21,4,"and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”"
Revelation,21,5,"And He who sits on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” And He *said, “Write, for these words are faithful and true.”"
Revelation,21,6,"Then He said to me, “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost."
Revelation,21,7,"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son."
Revelation,21,8,"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”"
Revelation,21,9,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”"
Revelation,21,10,"And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,"
Revelation,21,11,"having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper."
Revelation,21,12,"It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names were written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel."
Revelation,21,13,There were three gates on the east and three gates on the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west.
Revelation,21,14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
Revelation,21,15,"The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall."
Revelation,21,16,"The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal."
Revelation,21,17,"And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, according to human measurements, which are also angelic measurements."
Revelation,21,18,"The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass."
Revelation,21,19,"The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;"
Revelation,21,20,"the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst."
Revelation,21,21,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass."
Revelation,21,22,"I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."
Revelation,21,23,"And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb."
Revelation,21,24,"The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it."
Revelation,21,25,In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed;
Revelation,21,26,and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;
Revelation,21,27,"and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life."
Revelation,22,1,"Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,"
Revelation,22,2,"in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
Revelation,22,3,"There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;"
Revelation,22,4,"they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads."
Revelation,22,5,"And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever."
Revelation,22,6,"And he said to me, “These words are faithful and true”; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place."
Revelation,22,7,"“And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.”"
Revelation,22,8,"I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things."
Revelation,22,9,"But he *said to me, “Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book. Worship God.”"
Revelation,22,10,"And he *said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near."
Revelation,22,11,"Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy.”"
Revelation,22,12,"“Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done."
Revelation,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”"
Revelation,22,14,"Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city."
Revelation,22,15,"Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying."
Revelation,22,16,"“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”"
Revelation,22,17,"The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost."
Revelation,22,18,"I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;"
Revelation,22,19,"and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book."
Revelation,22,20,"He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus."
Revelation,22,21,The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil."
Job,1,2,Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
Job,1,3,"His possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
Job,1,4,"His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them."
Job,1,5,"When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually."
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them."
Job,1,7,"The LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”"
Job,1,8,"The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.”"
Job,1,9,"Then Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing?"
Job,1,10,"Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land."
Job,1,11,But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face.”
Job,1,12,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.” So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD."
Job,1,13,"Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,14,"a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,"
Job,1,15,"and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,16,"While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,17,"While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,18,"While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,19,"and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped."
Job,1,21,"He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD.”"
Job,1,22,Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD."
Job,2,2,"The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”"
Job,2,3,"The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”"
Job,2,4,"Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life."
Job,2,5,"However, put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face.”"
Job,2,6,"So the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life.”"
Job,2,7,Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
Job,2,8,And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!”"
Job,2,10,"But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips."
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"When they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky."
Job,2,13,"Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great."
Job,3,1,Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job,3,2,"And Job said,"
Job,3,3,"“Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And the night which said, ‘A boy is conceived.’"
Job,3,4,"“May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it, Nor light shine on it."
Job,3,5,“Let darkness and black gloom claim it; Let a cloud settle on it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"“As for that night, let darkness seize it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"“Behold, let that night be barren; Let no joyful shout enter it."
Job,3,8,"“Let those curse it who curse the day, Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan."
Job,3,9,"“Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; Let it wait for light but have none, And let it not see the breaking dawn;"
Job,3,10,"Because it did not shut the opening of my mother’s womb, Or hide trouble from my eyes."
Job,3,11,"“Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and expire?"
Job,3,12,"“Why did the knees receive me, And why the breasts, that I should suck?"
Job,3,13,"“For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept then, I would have been at rest,"
Job,3,14,"With kings and with counselors of the earth, Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes who had gold, Who were filling their houses with silver."
Job,3,16,"“Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be, As infants that never saw light."
Job,3,17,"“There the wicked cease from raging, And there the weary are at rest."
Job,3,18,“The prisoners are at ease together; They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
Job,3,19,"“The small and the great are there, And the slave is free from his master."
Job,3,20,"“Why is light given to him who suffers, And life to the bitter of soul,"
Job,3,21,"Who long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than for hidden treasures,"
Job,3,22,"Who rejoice greatly, And exult when they find the grave?"
Job,3,23,"“Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"“For my groaning comes at the sight of my food, And my cries pour out like water."
Job,3,25,"“For what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread befalls me."
Job,3,26,"“I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.”"
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
Job,4,2,"“If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"“Behold you have admonished many, And you have strengthened weak hands."
Job,4,4,"“Your words have helped the tottering to stand, And you have strengthened feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"“But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; It touches you, and you are dismayed."
Job,4,6,"“Is not your fear of God your confidence, And the integrity of your ways your hope?"
Job,4,7,"“Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?"
Job,4,8,"“According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity And those who sow trouble harvest it."
Job,4,9,"“By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end."
Job,4,10,"“The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken."
Job,4,11,"“The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered."
Job,4,12,"“Now a word was brought to me stealthily, And my ear received a whisper of it."
Job,4,13,"“Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,"
Job,4,14,"Dread came upon me, and trembling, And made all my bones shake."
Job,4,15,“Then a spirit passed by my face; The hair of my flesh bristled up.
Job,4,16,"“It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes; There was silence, then I heard a voice:"
Job,4,17,‘Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
Job,4,18,‘He puts no trust even in His servants; And against His angels He charges error.
Job,4,19,"‘How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!"
Job,4,20,"‘Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces; Unobserved, they perish forever."
Job,4,21,"‘Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, yet without wisdom.’"
Job,5,1,"“Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?"
Job,5,2,"“For anger slays the foolish man, And jealousy kills the simple."
Job,5,3,"“I have seen the foolish taking root, And I cursed his abode immediately."
Job,5,4,"“His sons are far from safety, They are even oppressed in the gate, And there is no deliverer."
Job,5,5,"“His harvest the hungry devour And take it to a place of thorns, And the schemer is eager for their wealth."
Job,5,6,"“For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble sprout from the ground,"
Job,5,7,"For man is born for trouble, As sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"“But as for me, I would seek God, And I would place my cause before God;"
Job,5,9,"Who does great and unsearchable things, Wonders without number."
Job,5,10,"“He gives rain on the earth And sends water on the fields,"
Job,5,11,"So that He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety."
Job,5,12,"“He frustrates the plotting of the shrewd, So that their hands cannot attain success."
Job,5,13,"“He captures the wise by their own shrewdness, And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted."
Job,5,14,"“By day they meet with darkness, And grope at noon as in the night."
Job,5,15,"“But He saves from the sword of their mouth, And the poor from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"“So the helpless has hope, And unrighteousness must shut its mouth."
Job,5,17,"“Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"“For He inflicts pain, and gives relief; He wounds, and His hands also heal."
Job,5,19,"“From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil will not touch you."
Job,5,20,"“In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword."
Job,5,21,"“You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes."
Job,5,22,"“You will laugh at violence and famine, And you will not be afraid of wild beasts."
Job,5,23,"“For you will be in league with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you."
Job,5,24,"“You will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit your abode and fear no loss."
Job,5,25,"“You will know also that your descendants will be many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"“You will come to the grave in full vigor, Like the stacking of grain in its season."
Job,5,27,"“Behold this; we have investigated it, and so it is. Hear it, and know for yourself.”"
Job,6,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,6,2,“Oh that my grief were actually weighed And laid in the balances together with my calamity!
Job,6,3,“For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; Therefore my words have been rash.
Job,6,4,"“For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, Their poison my spirit drinks; The terrors of God are arrayed against me."
Job,6,5,"“Does the wild donkey bray over his grass, Or does the ox low over his fodder?"
Job,6,6,"“Can something tasteless be eaten without salt, Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?"
Job,6,7,“My soul refuses to touch them; They are like loathsome food to me.
Job,6,8,"“Oh that my request might come to pass, And that God would grant my longing!"
Job,6,9,"“Would that God were willing to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"“But it is still my consolation, And I rejoice in unsparing pain, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"“What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should endure?"
Job,6,12,"“Is my strength the strength of stones, Or is my flesh bronze?"
Job,6,13,"“Is it that my help is not within me, And that deliverance is driven from me?"
Job,6,14,“For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend; So that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"“My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi, Like the torrents of wadis which vanish,"
Job,6,16,Which are turbid because of ice And into which the snow melts.
Job,6,17,"“When they become waterless, they are silent, When it is hot, they vanish from their place."
Job,6,18,"“The paths of their course wind along, They go up into nothing and perish."
Job,6,19,"“The caravans of Tema looked, The travelers of Sheba hoped for them."
Job,6,20,"“They were disappointed for they had trusted, They came there and were confounded."
Job,6,21,"“Indeed, you have now become such, You see a terror and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"“Have I said, ‘Give me something,’ Or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,’"
Job,6,23,"Or, ‘Deliver me from the hand of the adversary,’ Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants’?"
Job,6,24,"“Teach me, and I will be silent; And show me how I have erred."
Job,6,25,“How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?
Job,6,26,"“Do you intend to reprove my words, When the words of one in despair belong to the wind?"
Job,6,27,“You would even cast lots for the orphans And barter over your friend.
Job,6,28,"“Now please look at me, And see if I lie to your face."
Job,6,29,"“Desist now, let there be no injustice; Even desist, my righteousness is yet in it."
Job,6,30,“Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern calamities?
Job,7,1,"“Is not man forced to labor on earth, And are not his days like the days of a hired man?"
Job,7,2,"“As a slave who pants for the shade, And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages,"
Job,7,3,"So am I allotted months of vanity, And nights of trouble are appointed me."
Job,7,4,"“When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I arise?’ But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until dawn."
Job,7,5,"“My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt, My skin hardens and runs."
Job,7,6,"“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And come to an end without hope."
Job,7,7,“Remember that my life is but breath; My eye will not again see good.
Job,7,8,"“The eye of him who sees me will behold me no longer; Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be."
Job,7,9,"“When a cloud vanishes, it is gone, So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up."
Job,7,10,"“He will not return again to his house, Nor will his place know him anymore."
Job,7,11,"“Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
Job,7,12,"“Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That You set a guard over me?"
Job,7,13,"“If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,’"
Job,7,14,Then You frighten me with dreams And terrify me by visions;
Job,7,15,"So that my soul would choose suffocation, Death rather than my pains."
Job,7,16,"“I waste away; I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath."
Job,7,17,"“What is man that You magnify him, And that You are concerned about him,"
Job,7,18,That You examine him every morning And try him every moment?
Job,7,19,"“Will You never turn Your gaze away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"“Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"“Why then do You not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And You will seek me, but I will not be.”"
Job,8,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
Job,8,2,"“How long will you say these things, And the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?"
Job,8,3,“Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
Job,8,4,"“If your sons sinned against Him, Then He delivered them into the power of their transgression."
Job,8,5,"“If you would seek God And implore the compassion of the Almighty,"
Job,8,6,"If you are pure and upright, Surely now He would rouse Himself for you And restore your righteous estate."
Job,8,7,"“Though your beginning was insignificant, Yet your end will increase greatly."
Job,8,8,"“Please inquire of past generations, And consider the things searched out by their fathers."
Job,8,9,"“For we are only of yesterday and know nothing, Because our days on earth are as a shadow."
Job,8,10,"“Will they not teach you and tell you, And bring forth words from their minds?"
Job,8,11,“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the rushes grow without water?
Job,8,12,"“While it is still green and not cut down, Yet it withers before any other plant."
Job,8,13,"“So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the godless will perish,"
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence is fragile, And whose trust a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"“He trusts in his house, but it does not stand; He holds fast to it, but it does not endure."
Job,8,16,"“He thrives before the sun, And his shoots spread out over his garden."
Job,8,17,"“His roots wrap around a rock pile, He grasps a house of stones."
Job,8,18,"“If he is removed from his place, Then it will deny him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’"
Job,8,19,"“Behold, this is the joy of His way; And out of the dust others will spring."
Job,8,20,"“Lo, God will not reject a man of integrity, Nor will He support the evildoers."
Job,8,21,“He will yet fill your mouth with laughter And your lips with shouting.
Job,8,22,"“Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the tent of the wicked will be no longer.”"
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,9,2,“In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man be in the right before God?
Job,9,3,"“If one wished to dispute with Him, He could not answer Him once in a thousand times."
Job,9,4,"“Wise in heart and mighty in strength, Who has defied Him without harm?"
Job,9,5,"“It is God who removes the mountains, they know not how, When He overturns them in His anger;"
Job,9,6,"Who shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;"
Job,9,7,"Who commands the sun not to shine, And sets a seal upon the stars;"
Job,9,8,Who alone stretches out the heavens And tramples down the waves of the sea;
Job,9,9,"Who makes the Bear, Orion and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;"
Job,9,10,"Who does great things, unfathomable, And wondrous works without number."
Job,9,11,"“Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; Were He to move past me, I would not perceive Him."
Job,9,12,"“Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’"
Job,9,13,“God will not turn back His anger; Beneath Him crouch the helpers of Rahab.
Job,9,14,"“How then can I answer Him, And choose my words before Him?"
Job,9,15,"“For though I were right, I could not answer; I would have to implore the mercy of my judge."
Job,9,16,"“If I called and He answered me, I could not believe that He was listening to my voice."
Job,9,17,“For He bruises me with a tempest And multiplies my wounds without cause.
Job,9,18,"“He will not allow me to get my breath, But saturates me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"“If it is a matter of power, behold, He is the strong one! And if it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?"
Job,9,20,"“Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; Though I am guiltless, He will declare me guilty."
Job,9,21,“I am guiltless; I do not take notice of myself; I despise my life.
Job,9,22,"“It is all one; therefore I say, ‘He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.’"
Job,9,23,"“If the scourge kills suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"“The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?"
Job,9,25,"“Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,"“They slip by like reed boats, Like an eagle that swoops on its prey."
Job,9,27,"“Though I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sad countenance and be cheerful,’"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my pains, I know that You will not acquit me."
Job,9,29,"“I am accounted wicked, Why then should I toil in vain?"
Job,9,30,"“If I should wash myself with snow And cleanse my hands with lye,"
Job,9,31,"Yet You would plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes would abhor me."
Job,9,32,"“For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That we may go to court together."
Job,9,33,"“There is no umpire between us, Who may lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"“Let Him remove His rod from me, And let not dread of Him terrify me."
Job,9,35,“Then I would speak and not fear Him; But I am not like that in myself.
Job,10,1,“I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"“I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me; Let me know why You contend with me."
Job,10,3,"‘Is it right for You indeed to oppress, To reject the labor of Your hands, And to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,‘Have You eyes of flesh? Or do You see as a man sees?
Job,10,5,"‘Are Your days as the days of a mortal, Or Your years as man’s years,"
Job,10,6,That You should seek for my guilt And search after my sin?
Job,10,7,"‘According to Your knowledge I am indeed not guilty, Yet there is no deliverance from Your hand."
Job,10,8,"‘Your hands fashioned and made me altogether, And would You destroy me?"
Job,10,9,"‘Remember now, that You have made me as clay; And would You turn me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,‘Did You not pour me out like milk And curdle me like cheese;
Job,10,11,"Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews?"
Job,10,12,‘You have granted me life and lovingkindness; And Your care has preserved my spirit.
Job,10,13,‘Yet these things You have concealed in Your heart; I know that this is within You:
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then You would take note of me, And would not acquit me of my guilt."
Job,10,15,"‘If I am wicked, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head. I am sated with disgrace and conscious of my misery."
Job,10,16,"‘Should my head be lifted up, You would hunt me like a lion; And again You would show Your power against me."
Job,10,17,‘You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your anger toward me; Hardship after hardship is with me.
Job,10,18,‘Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me!
Job,10,19,"‘I should have been as though I had not been, Carried from womb to tomb.’"
Job,10,20,“Would He not let my few days alone? Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer
Job,10,21,"Before I go—and I shall not return— To the land of darkness and deep shadow,"
Job,10,22,"The land of utter gloom as darkness itself, Of deep shadow without order, And which shines as the darkness.”"
Job,11,1,"Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,"
Job,11,2,"“Shall a multitude of words go unanswered, And a talkative man be acquitted?"
Job,11,3,“Shall your boasts silence men? And shall you scoff and none rebuke?
Job,11,4,"“For you have said, ‘My teaching is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.’"
Job,11,5,"“But would that God might speak, And open His lips against you,"
Job,11,6,And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two sides. Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity.
Job,11,7,“Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?
Job,11,8,"“They are high as the heavens, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol, what can you know?"
Job,11,9,“Its measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea.
Job,11,10,"“If He passes by or shuts up, Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him?"
Job,11,11,"“For He knows false men, And He sees iniquity without investigating."
Job,11,12,“An idiot will become intelligent When the foal of a wild donkey is born a man.
Job,11,13,"“If you would direct your heart right And spread out your hand to Him,"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents;"
Job,11,15,"“Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without moral defect, And you would be steadfast and not fear."
Job,11,16,"“For you would forget your trouble, As waters that have passed by, you would remember it."
Job,11,17,“Your life would be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning.
Job,11,18,"“Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely."
Job,11,19,"“You would lie down and none would disturb you, And many would entreat your favor."
Job,11,20,"“But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And there will be no escape for them; And their hope is to breathe their last.”"
Job,12,1,"Then Job responded,"
Job,12,2,"“Truly then you are the people, And with you wisdom will die!"
Job,12,3,“But I have intelligence as well as you; I am not inferior to you. And who does not know such things as these?
Job,12,4,"“I am a joke to my friends, The one who called on God and He answered him; The just and blameless man is a joke."
Job,12,5,"“He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt, As prepared for those whose feet slip."
Job,12,6,"“The tents of the destroyers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure, Whom God brings into their power."
Job,12,7,"“But now ask the beasts, and let them teach you; And the birds of the heavens, and let them tell you."
Job,12,8,"“Or speak to the earth, and let it teach you; And let the fish of the sea declare to you."
Job,12,9,"“Who among all these does not know That the hand of the LORD has done this,"
Job,12,10,"In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?"
Job,12,11,"“Does not the ear test words, As the palate tastes its food?"
Job,12,12,"“Wisdom is with aged men, With long life is understanding."
Job,12,13,“With Him are wisdom and might; To Him belong counsel and understanding.
Job,12,14,"“Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release."
Job,12,15,"“Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up; And He sends them out, and they inundate the earth."
Job,12,16,"“With Him are strength and sound wisdom, The misled and the misleader belong to Him."
Job,12,17,“He makes counselors walk barefoot And makes fools of judges.
Job,12,18,“He loosens the bond of kings And binds their loins with a girdle.
Job,12,19,“He makes priests walk barefoot And overthrows the secure ones.
Job,12,20,“He deprives the trusted ones of speech And takes away the discernment of the elders.
Job,12,21,“He pours contempt on nobles And loosens the belt of the strong.
Job,12,22,“He reveals mysteries from the darkness And brings the deep darkness into light.
Job,12,23,"“He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away."
Job,12,24,“He deprives of intelligence the chiefs of the earth’s people And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
Job,12,25,"“They grope in darkness with no light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man."
Job,13,1,"“Behold, my eye has seen all this, My ear has heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,“What you know I also know; I am not inferior to you.
Job,13,3,"“But I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to argue with God."
Job,13,4,“But you smear with lies; You are all worthless physicians.
Job,13,5,"“O that you would be completely silent, And that it would become your wisdom!"
Job,13,6,“Please hear my argument And listen to the contentions of my lips.
Job,13,7,"“Will you speak what is unjust for God, And speak what is deceitful for Him?"
Job,13,8,“Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God?
Job,13,9,“Will it be well when He examines you? Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
Job,13,10,“He will surely reprove you If you secretly show partiality.
Job,13,11,"“Will not His majesty terrify you, And the dread of Him fall on you?"
Job,13,12,"“Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay."
Job,13,13,“Be silent before me so that I may speak; Then let come on me what may.
Job,13,14,“Why should I take my flesh in my teeth And put my life in my hands?
Job,13,15,"“Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him."
Job,13,16,"“This also will be my salvation, For a godless man may not come before His presence."
Job,13,17,"“Listen carefully to my speech, And let my declaration fill your ears."
Job,13,18,"“Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated."
Job,13,19,“Who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
Job,13,20,"“Only two things do not do to me, Then I will not hide from Your face:"
Job,13,21,"Remove Your hand from me, And let not the dread of You terrify me."
Job,13,22,"“Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then reply to me."
Job,13,23,“How many are my iniquities and sins? Make known to me my rebellion and my sin.
Job,13,24,“Why do You hide Your face And consider me Your enemy?
Job,13,25,“Will You cause a driven leaf to tremble? Or will You pursue the dry chaff?
Job,13,26,“For You write bitter things against me And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
Job,13,27,"“You put my feet in the stocks And watch all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet,"
Job,13,28,"While I am decaying like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,"“Man, who is born of woman, Is short-lived and full of turmoil."
Job,14,2,“Like a flower he comes forth and withers. He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
Job,14,3,“You also open Your eyes on him And bring him into judgment with Yourself.
Job,14,4,“Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one!
Job,14,5,"“Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; And his limits You have set so that he cannot pass."
Job,14,6,"“Turn Your gaze from him that he may rest, Until he fulfills his day like a hired man."
Job,14,7,"“For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail."
Job,14,8,"“Though its roots grow old in the ground And its stump dies in the dry soil,"
Job,14,9,At the scent of water it will flourish And put forth sprigs like a plant.
Job,14,10,"“But man dies and lies prostrate. Man expires, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"“As water evaporates from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dried up,"
Job,14,12,"So man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no longer, He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep."
Job,14,13,"“Oh that You would hide me in Sheol, That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns to You, That You would set a limit for me and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"“If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my struggle I will wait Until my change comes."
Job,14,15,"“You will call, and I will answer You; You will long for the work of Your hands."
Job,14,16,"“For now You number my steps, You do not observe my sin."
Job,14,17,"“My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And You wrap up my iniquity."
Job,14,18,"“But the falling mountain crumbles away, And the rock moves from its place;"
Job,14,19,"Water wears away stones, Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth; So You destroy man’s hope."
Job,14,20,“You forever overpower him and he departs; You change his appearance and send him away.
Job,14,21,"“His sons achieve honor, but he does not know it; Or they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it."
Job,14,22,"“But his body pains him, And he mourns only for himself.”"
Job,15,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,"
Job,15,2,“Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge And fill himself with the east wind?
Job,15,3,"“Should he argue with useless talk, Or with words which are not profitable?"
Job,15,4,"“Indeed, you do away with reverence And hinder meditation before God."
Job,15,5,"“For your guilt teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"“Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; And your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,7,"“Were you the first man to be born, Or were you brought forth before the hills?"
Job,15,8,"“Do you hear the secret counsel of God, And limit wisdom to yourself?"
Job,15,9,“What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we do not?
Job,15,10,"“Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Older than your father."
Job,15,11,"“Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word spoken gently with you?"
Job,15,12,"“Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash,"
Job,15,13,That you should turn your spirit against God And allow such words to go out of your mouth?
Job,15,14,"“What is man, that he should be pure, Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"“Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones, And the heavens are not pure in His sight;"
Job,15,16,"How much less one who is detestable and corrupt, Man, who drinks iniquity like water!"
Job,15,17,"“I will tell you, listen to me; And what I have seen I will also declare;"
Job,15,18,"What wise men have told, And have not concealed from their fathers,"
Job,15,19,"To whom alone the land was given, And no alien passed among them."
Job,15,20,"“The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, And numbered are the years stored up for the ruthless."
Job,15,21,“Sounds of terror are in his ears; While at peace the destroyer comes upon him.
Job,15,22,"“He does not believe that he will return from darkness, And he is destined for the sword."
Job,15,23,"“He wanders about for food, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that a day of darkness is at hand."
Job,15,24,"“Distress and anguish terrify him, They overpower him like a king ready for the attack,"
Job,15,25,Because he has stretched out his hand against God And conducts himself arrogantly against the Almighty.
Job,15,26,“He rushes headlong at Him With his massive shield.
Job,15,27,“For he has covered his face with his fat And made his thighs heavy with flesh.
Job,15,28,"“He has lived in desolate cities, In houses no one would inhabit, Which are destined to become ruins."
Job,15,29,"“He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure; And his grain will not bend down to the ground."
Job,15,30,"“He will not escape from darkness; The flame will wither his shoots, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away."
Job,15,31,"“Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; For emptiness will be his reward."
Job,15,32,"“It will be accomplished before his time, And his palm branch will not be green."
Job,15,33,"“He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine, And will cast off his flower like the olive tree."
Job,15,34,"“For the company of the godless is barren, And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt."
Job,15,35,"“They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, And their mind prepares deception.”"
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,16,2,“I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are you all.
Job,16,3,“Is there no limit to windy words? Or what plagues you that you answer?
Job,16,4,"“I too could speak like you, If I were in your place. I could compose words against you And shake my head at you."
Job,16,5,"“I could strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips could lessen your pain."
Job,16,6,"“If I speak, my pain is not lessened, And if I hold back, what has left me?"
Job,16,7,“But now He has exhausted me; You have laid waste all my company.
Job,16,8,"“You have shriveled me up, It has become a witness; And my leanness rises up against me, It testifies to my face."
Job,16,9,"“His anger has torn me and hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with His teeth; My adversary glares at me."
Job,16,10,"“They have gaped at me with their mouth, They have slapped me on the cheek with contempt; They have massed themselves against me."
Job,16,11,“God hands me over to ruffians And tosses me into the hands of the wicked.
Job,16,12,"“I was at ease, but He shattered me, And He has grasped me by the neck and shaken me to pieces; He has also set me up as His target."
Job,16,13,“His arrows surround me. Without mercy He splits my kidneys open; He pours out my gall on the ground.
Job,16,14,“He breaks through me with breach after breach; He runs at me like a warrior.
Job,16,15,“I have sewed sackcloth over my skin And thrust my horn in the dust.
Job,16,16,"“My face is flushed from weeping, And deep darkness is on my eyelids,"
Job,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure."
Job,16,18,"“O earth, do not cover my blood, And let there be no resting place for my cry."
Job,16,19,"“Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And my advocate is on high."
Job,16,20,“My friends are my scoffers; My eye weeps to God.
Job,16,21,“O that a man might plead with God As a man with his neighbor!
Job,16,22,"“For when a few years are past, I shall go the way of no return."
Job,17,1,"“My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The grave is ready for me."
Job,17,2,"“Surely mockers are with me, And my eye gazes on their provocation."
Job,17,3,"“Lay down, now, a pledge for me with Yourself; Who is there that will be my guarantor?"
Job,17,4,"“For You have kept their heart from understanding, Therefore You will not exalt them."
Job,17,5,"“He who informs against friends for a share of the spoil, The eyes of his children also will languish."
Job,17,6,"“But He has made me a byword of the people, And I am one at whom men spit."
Job,17,7,"“My eye has also grown dim because of grief, And all my members are as a shadow."
Job,17,8,"“The upright will be appalled at this, And the innocent will stir up himself against the godless."
Job,17,9,"“Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger."
Job,17,10,"“But come again all of you now, For I do not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"“My days are past, my plans are torn apart, Even the wishes of my heart."
Job,17,12,"“They make night into day, saying, ‘The light is near,’ in the presence of darkness."
Job,17,13,"“If I look for Sheol as my home, I make my bed in the darkness;"
Job,17,14,"If I call to the pit, ‘You are my father’; To the worm, ‘my mother and my sister’;"
Job,17,15,Where now is my hope? And who regards my hope?
Job,17,16,“Will it go down with me to Sheol? Shall we together go down into the dust?”
Job,18,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,"
Job,18,2,“How long will you hunt for words? Show understanding and then we can talk.
Job,18,3,"“Why are we regarded as beasts, As stupid in your eyes?"
Job,18,4,"“O you who tear yourself in your anger— For your sake is the earth to be abandoned, Or the rock to be moved from its place?"
Job,18,5,"“Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out, And the flame of his fire gives no light."
Job,18,6,"“The light in his tent is darkened, And his lamp goes out above him."
Job,18,7,"“His vigorous stride is shortened, And his own scheme brings him down."
Job,18,8,"“For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, And he steps on the webbing."
Job,18,9,"“A snare seizes him by the heel, And a trap snaps shut on him."
Job,18,10,"“A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the path."
Job,18,11,"“All around terrors frighten him, And harry him at every step."
Job,18,12,"“His strength is famished, And calamity is ready at his side."
Job,18,13,"“His skin is devoured by disease, The firstborn of death devours his limbs."
Job,18,14,"“He is torn from the security of his tent, And they march him before the king of terrors."
Job,18,15,“There dwells in his tent nothing of his; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.
Job,18,16,"“His roots are dried below, And his branch is cut off above."
Job,18,17,"“Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad."
Job,18,18,"“He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world."
Job,18,19,"“He has no offspring or posterity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned."
Job,18,20,"“Those in the west are appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror."
Job,18,21,"“Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God.”"
Job,19,1,"Then Job responded,"
Job,19,2,“How long will you torment me And crush me with words?
Job,19,3,“These ten times you have insulted me; You are not ashamed to wrong me.
Job,19,4,"“Even if I have truly erred, My error lodges with me."
Job,19,5,"“If indeed you vaunt yourselves against me And prove my disgrace to me,"
Job,19,6,Know then that God has wronged me And has closed His net around me.
Job,19,7,"“Behold, I cry, ‘Violence!’ but I get no answer; I shout for help, but there is no justice."
Job,19,8,"“He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, And He has put darkness on my paths."
Job,19,9,“He has stripped my honor from me And removed the crown from my head.
Job,19,10,"“He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree."
Job,19,11,“He has also kindled His anger against me And considered me as His enemy.
Job,19,12,"“His troops come together, And build up their way against me And camp around my tent."
Job,19,13,"“He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me."
Job,19,14,"“My relatives have failed, And my intimate friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,“Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight.
Job,19,16,"“I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I have to implore him with my mouth."
Job,19,17,"“My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers."
Job,19,18,“Even young children despise me; I rise up and they speak against me.
Job,19,19,"“All my associates abhor me, And those I love have turned against me."
Job,19,20,"“My bone clings to my skin and my flesh, And I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth."
Job,19,21,"“Pity me, pity me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me."
Job,19,22,"“Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,“Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
Job,19,24,“That with an iron stylus and lead They were engraved in the rock forever!
Job,19,25,"“As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the last He will take His stand on the earth."
Job,19,26,"“Even after my skin is destroyed, Yet from my flesh I shall see God;"
Job,19,27,"Whom I myself shall behold, And whom my eyes will see and not another. My heart faints within me!"
Job,19,28,"“If you say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’ And ‘What pretext for a case against him can we find?’"
Job,19,29,"“Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves, For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, So that you may know there is judgment.”"
Job,20,1,"Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,"
Job,20,2,"“Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond, Even because of my inward agitation."
Job,20,3,"“I listened to the reproof which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer."
Job,20,4,"“Do you know this from of old, From the establishment of man on earth,"
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary?"
Job,20,6,"“Though his loftiness reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds,"
Job,20,7,"He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’"
Job,20,8,"“He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away."
Job,20,9,"“The eye which saw him sees him no longer, And his place no longer beholds him."
Job,20,10,"“His sons favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth."
Job,20,11,"“His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it lies down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"“Though evil is sweet in his mouth And he hides it under his tongue,"
Job,20,13,"Though he desires it and will not let it go, But holds it in his mouth,"
Job,20,14,Yet his food in his stomach is changed To the venom of cobras within him.
Job,20,15,"“He swallows riches, But will vomit them up; God will expel them from his belly."
Job,20,16,“He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper’s tongue slays him.
Job,20,17,"“He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds."
Job,20,18,"“He returns what he has attained And cannot swallow it; As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy them."
Job,20,19,“For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; He has seized a house which he has not built.
Job,20,20,"“Because he knew no quiet within him, He does not retain anything he desires."
Job,20,21,"“Nothing remains for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure."
Job,20,22,“In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him.
Job,20,23,"“When he fills his belly, God will send His fierce anger on him And will rain it on him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,"“He may flee from the iron weapon, But the bronze bow will pierce him."
Job,20,25,"“It is drawn forth and comes out of his back, Even the glittering point from his gall. Terrors come upon him,"
Job,20,26,"Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent."
Job,20,27,"“The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him."
Job,20,28,“The increase of his house will depart; His possessions will flow away in the day of His anger.
Job,20,29,"“This is the wicked man’s portion from God, Even the heritage decreed to him by God.”"
Job,21,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,21,2,"“Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your way of consolation."
Job,21,3,"“Bear with me that I may speak; Then after I have spoken, you may mock."
Job,21,4,"“As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?"
Job,21,5,"“Look at me, and be astonished, And put your hand over your mouth."
Job,21,6,"“Even when I remember, I am disturbed, And horror takes hold of my flesh."
Job,21,7,"“Why do the wicked still live, Continue on, also become very powerful?"
Job,21,8,"“Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes,"
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, And the rod of God is not on them."
Job,21,10,“His ox mates without fail; His cow calves and does not abort.
Job,21,11,"“They send forth their little ones like the flock, And their children skip about."
Job,21,12,“They sing to the timbrel and harp And rejoice at the sound of the flute.
Job,21,13,"“They spend their days in prosperity, And suddenly they go down to Sheol."
Job,21,14,"“They say to God, ‘Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways."
Job,21,15,"‘Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we entreat Him?’"
Job,21,16,"“Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,"“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, Or does their calamity fall on them? Does God apportion destruction in His anger?"
Job,21,18,"“Are they as straw before the wind, And like chaff which the storm carries away?"
Job,21,19,"“You say, ‘God stores away a man’s iniquity for his sons.’ Let God repay him so that he may know it."
Job,21,20,"“Let his own eyes see his decay, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"“For what does he care for his household after him, When the number of his months is cut off?"
Job,21,22,"“Can anyone teach God knowledge, In that He judges those on high?"
Job,21,23,"“One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and satisfied;"
Job,21,24,"His sides are filled out with fat, And the marrow of his bones is moist,"
Job,21,25,"While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting anything good."
Job,21,26,"“Together they lie down in the dust, And worms cover them."
Job,21,27,"“Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plans by which you would wrong me."
Job,21,28,"“For you say, ‘Where is the house of the nobleman, And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?’"
Job,21,29,"“Have you not asked wayfaring men, And do you not recognize their witness?"
Job,21,30,“For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity; They will be led forth at the day of fury.
Job,21,31,"“Who will confront him with his actions, And who will repay him for what he has done?"
Job,21,32,"“While he is carried to the grave, Men will keep watch over his tomb."
Job,21,33,"“The clods of the valley will gently cover him; Moreover, all men will follow after him, While countless ones go before him."
Job,21,34,"“How then will you vainly comfort me, For your answers remain full of falsehood?”"
Job,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,"
Job,22,2,"“Can a vigorous man be of use to God, Or a wise man be useful to himself?"
Job,22,3,"“Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, Or profit if you make your ways perfect?"
Job,22,4,"“Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you, That He enters into judgment against you?"
Job,22,5,"“Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquities without end?"
Job,22,6,"“For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause, And stripped men naked."
Job,22,7,"“To the weary you have given no water to drink, And from the hungry you have withheld bread."
Job,22,8,"“But the earth belongs to the mighty man, And the honorable man dwells in it."
Job,22,9,"“You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the orphans has been crushed."
Job,22,10,"“Therefore snares surround you, And sudden dread terrifies you,"
Job,22,11,"Or darkness, so that you cannot see, And an abundance of water covers you."
Job,22,12,"“Is not God in the height of heaven? Look also at the distant stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,13,"“You say, ‘What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness?"
Job,22,14,"‘Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the vault of heaven.’"
Job,22,15,"“Will you keep to the ancient path Which wicked men have trod,"
Job,22,16,"Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were washed away by a river?"
Job,22,17,"“They said to God, ‘Depart from us!’ And ‘What can the Almighty do to them?’"
Job,22,18,“Yet He filled their houses with good things; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"“The righteous see and are glad, And the innocent mock them,"
Job,22,20,"Saying, ‘Truly our adversaries are cut off, And their abundance the fire has consumed.’"
Job,22,21,“Yield now and be at peace with Him; Thereby good will come to you.
Job,22,22,“Please receive instruction from His mouth And establish His words in your heart.
Job,22,23,"“If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent,"
Job,22,24,"And place your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks,"
Job,22,25,Then the Almighty will be your gold And choice silver to you.
Job,22,26,“For then you will delight in the Almighty And lift up your face to God.
Job,22,27,"“You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; And you will pay your vows."
Job,22,28,"“You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And light will shine on your ways."
Job,22,29,"“When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will save."
Job,22,30,"“He will deliver one who is not innocent, And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”"
Job,23,1,"Then Job replied,"
Job,23,2,“Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
Job,23,3,"“Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!"
Job,23,4,“I would present my case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments.
Job,23,5,"“I would learn the words which He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me."
Job,23,6,"“Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power? No, surely He would pay attention to me."
Job,23,7,“There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
Job,23,8,"“Behold, I go forward but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;"
Job,23,9,"When He acts on the left, I cannot behold Him; He turns on the right, I cannot see Him."
Job,23,10,"“But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,“My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside.
Job,23,12,“I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,"“But He is unique and who can turn Him? And what His soul desires, that He does."
Job,23,14,"“For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such decrees are with Him."
Job,23,15,"“Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him."
Job,23,16,"“It is God who has made my heart faint, And the Almighty who has dismayed me,"
Job,23,17,"But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom which covers me."
Job,24,1,"“Why are times not stored up by the Almighty, And why do those who know Him not see His days?"
Job,24,2,“Some remove the landmarks; They seize and devour flocks.
Job,24,3,“They drive away the donkeys of the orphans; They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
Job,24,4,“They push the needy aside from the road; The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether.
Job,24,5,"“Behold, as wild donkeys in the wilderness They go forth seeking food in their activity, As bread for their children in the desert."
Job,24,6,“They harvest their fodder in the field And glean the vineyard of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"“They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering against the cold."
Job,24,8,“They are wet with the mountain rains And hug the rock for want of a shelter.
Job,24,9,"“Others snatch the orphan from the breast, And against the poor they take a pledge."
Job,24,10,"“They cause the poor to go about naked without clothing, And they take away the sheaves from the hungry."
Job,24,11,“Within the walls they produce oil; They tread wine presses but thirst.
Job,24,12,"“From the city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not pay attention to folly."
Job,24,13,“Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor abide in its paths.
Job,24,14,"“The murderer arises at dawn; He kills the poor and the needy, And at night he is as a thief."
Job,24,15,"“The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, ‘No eye will see me.’ And he disguises his face."
Job,24,16,"“In the dark they dig into houses, They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light."
Job,24,17,"“For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness, For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness."
Job,24,18,“They are insignificant on the surface of the water; Their portion is cursed on the earth. They do not turn toward the vineyards.
Job,24,19,"“Drought and heat consume the snow waters, So does Sheol those who have sinned."
Job,24,20,“A mother will forget him; The worm feeds sweetly till he is no longer remembered. And wickedness will be broken like a tree.
Job,24,21,“He wrongs the barren woman And does no good for the widow.
Job,24,22,"“But He drags off the valiant by His power; He rises, but no one has assurance of life."
Job,24,23,"“He provides them with security, and they are supported; And His eyes are on their ways."
Job,24,24,"“They are exalted a little while, then they are gone; Moreover, they are brought low and like everything gathered up; Even like the heads of grain they are cut off."
Job,24,25,"“Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar, And make my speech worthless?”"
Job,25,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
Job,25,2,“Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights.
Job,25,3,“Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise?
Job,25,4,“How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman?
Job,25,5,"“If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight,"
Job,25,6,"How much less man, that maggot, And the son of man, that worm!”"
Job,26,1,"Then Job responded,"
Job,26,2,“What a help you are to the weak! How you have saved the arm without strength!
Job,26,3,“What counsel you have given to one without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided!
Job,26,4,“To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you?
Job,26,5,“The departed spirits tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants.
Job,26,6,"“Naked is Sheol before Him, And Abaddon has no covering."
Job,26,7,“He stretches out the north over empty space And hangs the earth on nothing.
Job,26,8,"“He wraps up the waters in His clouds, And the cloud does not burst under them."
Job,26,9,“He obscures the face of the full moon And spreads His cloud over it.
Job,26,10,“He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness.
Job,26,11,“The pillars of heaven tremble And are amazed at His rebuke.
Job,26,12,"“He quieted the sea with His power, And by His understanding He shattered Rahab."
Job,26,13,“By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent.
Job,26,14,"“Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?”"
Job,27,1,"Then Job continued his discourse and said,"
Job,27,2,"“As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,"
Job,27,3,"For as long as life is in me, And the breath of God is in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"My lips certainly will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue mutter deceit."
Job,27,5,“Far be it from me that I should declare you right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job,27,6,“I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does not reproach any of my days.
Job,27,7,“May my enemy be as the wicked And my opponent as the unjust.
Job,27,8,"“For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, When God requires his life?"
Job,27,9,“Will God hear his cry When distress comes upon him?
Job,27,10,“Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times?
Job,27,11,“I will instruct you in the power of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
Job,27,12,"“Behold, all of you have seen it; Why then do you act foolishly?"
Job,27,13,"“This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the inheritance which tyrants receive from the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"“Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread."
Job,27,15,"“His survivors will be buried because of the plague, And their widows will not be able to weep."
Job,27,16,"“Though he piles up silver like dust And prepares garments as plentiful as the clay,"
Job,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"“He has built his house like the spider’s web, Or as a hut which the watchman has made."
Job,27,19,"“He lies down rich, but never again; He opens his eyes, and it is no longer."
Job,27,20,“Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night.
Job,27,21,"“The east wind carries him away, and he is gone, For it whirls him away from his place."
Job,27,22,“For it will hurl at him without sparing; He will surely try to flee from its power.
Job,27,23,“Men will clap their hands at him And will hiss him from his place.
Job,28,1,“Surely there is a mine for silver And a place where they refine gold.
Job,28,2,"“Iron is taken from the dust, And copper is smelted from rock."
Job,28,3,"“Man puts an end to darkness, And to the farthest limit he searches out The rock in gloom and deep shadow."
Job,28,4,"“He sinks a shaft far from habitation, Forgotten by the foot; They hang and swing to and fro far from men."
Job,28,5,"“The earth, from it comes food, And underneath it is turned up as fire."
Job,28,6,"“Its rocks are the source of sapphires, And its dust contains gold."
Job,28,7,"“The path no bird of prey knows, Nor has the falcon’s eye caught sight of it."
Job,28,8,"“The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it."
Job,28,9,“He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the base.
Job,28,10,"“He hews out channels through the rocks, And his eye sees anything precious."
Job,28,11,"“He dams up the streams from flowing, And what is hidden he brings out to the light."
Job,28,12,“But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,"“Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living."
Job,28,14,"“The deep says, ‘It is not in me’; And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’"
Job,28,15,"“Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, Nor can silver be weighed as its price."
Job,28,16,"“It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx, or sapphire."
Job,28,17,"“Gold or glass cannot equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold."
Job,28,18,“Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned; And the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.
Job,28,19,"“The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold."
Job,28,20,“Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,“Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living And concealed from the birds of the sky.
Job,28,22,"“Abaddon and Death say, ‘With our ears we have heard a report of it.’"
Job,28,23,"“God understands its way, And He knows its place."
Job,28,24,“For He looks to the ends of the earth And sees everything under the heavens.
Job,28,25,"“When He imparted weight to the wind And meted out the waters by measure,"
Job,28,26,"When He set a limit for the rain And a course for the thunderbolt,"
Job,28,27,Then He saw it and declared it; He established it and also searched it out.
Job,28,28,"“And to man He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.’”"
Job,29,1,"And Job again took up his discourse and said,"
Job,29,2,"“Oh that I were as in months gone by, As in the days when God watched over me;"
Job,29,3,"When His lamp shone over my head, And by His light I walked through darkness;"
Job,29,4,"As I was in the prime of my days, When the friendship of God was over my tent;"
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were around me;"
Job,29,6,"When my steps were bathed in butter, And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!"
Job,29,7,"“When I went out to the gate of the city, When I took my seat in the square,"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the old men arose and stood."
Job,29,9,“The princes stopped talking And put their hands on their mouths;
Job,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to their palate."
Job,29,11,"“For when the ear heard, it called me blessed, And when the eye saw, it gave witness of me,"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor who cried for help, And the orphan who had no helper."
Job,29,13,"“The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me, And I made the widow’s heart sing for joy."
Job,29,14,"“I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban."
Job,29,15,“I was eyes to the blind And feet to the lame.
Job,29,16,"“I was a father to the needy, And I investigated the case which I did not know."
Job,29,17,“I broke the jaws of the wicked And snatched the prey from his teeth.
Job,29,18,"“Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand."
Job,29,19,"‘My root is spread out to the waters, And dew lies all night on my branch."
Job,29,20,"‘My glory is ever new with me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.’"
Job,29,21,"“To me they listened and waited, And kept silent for my counsel."
Job,29,22,"“After my words they did not speak again, And my speech dropped on them."
Job,29,23,"“They waited for me as for the rain, And opened their mouth as for the spring rain."
Job,29,24,"“I smiled on them when they did not believe, And the light of my face they did not cast down."
Job,29,25,"“I chose a way for them and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king among the troops, As one who comforted the mourners."
Job,30,1,"“But now those younger than I mock me, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"“Indeed, what good was the strength of their hands to me? Vigor had perished from them."
Job,30,3,"“From want and famine they are gaunt Who gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation,"
Job,30,4,"Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And whose food is the root of the broom shrub."
Job,30,5,"“They are driven from the community; They shout against them as against a thief,"
Job,30,6,"So that they dwell in dreadful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks."
Job,30,7,“Among the bushes they cry out; Under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job,30,8,"“Fools, even those without a name, They were scourged from the land."
Job,30,9,"“And now I have become their taunt, I have even become a byword to them."
Job,30,10,"“They abhor me and stand aloof from me, And they do not refrain from spitting at my face."
Job,30,11,"“Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off the bridle before me."
Job,30,12,“On the right hand their brood arises; They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction.
Job,30,13,"“They break up my path, They profit from my destruction; No one restrains them."
Job,30,14,"“As through a wide breach they come, Amid the tempest they roll on."
Job,30,15,"“Terrors are turned against me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud."
Job,30,16,“And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have seized me.
Job,30,17,"“At night it pierces my bones within me, And my gnawing pains take no rest."
Job,30,18,“By a great force my garment is distorted; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"“He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"“I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You turn Your attention against me."
Job,30,21,“You have become cruel to me; With the might of Your hand You persecute me.
Job,30,22,“You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride; And You dissolve me in a storm.
Job,30,23,“For I know that You will bring me to death And to the house of meeting for all living.
Job,30,24,"“Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help?"
Job,30,25,“Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
Job,30,26,"“When I expected good, then evil came; When I waited for light, then darkness came."
Job,30,27,“I am seething within and cannot relax; Days of affliction confront me.
Job,30,28,“I go about mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help.
Job,30,29,“I have become a brother to jackals And a companion of ostriches.
Job,30,30,"“My skin turns black on me, And my bones burn with fever."
Job,30,31,"“Therefore my harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the sound of those who weep."
Job,31,1,“I have made a covenant with my eyes; How then could I gaze at a virgin?
Job,31,2,“And what is the portion of God from above Or the heritage of the Almighty from on high?
Job,31,3,“Is it not calamity to the unjust And disaster to those who work iniquity?
Job,31,4,“Does He not see my ways And number all my steps?
Job,31,5,"“If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot has hastened after deceit,"
Job,31,6,"Let Him weigh me with accurate scales, And let God know my integrity."
Job,31,7,"“If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart followed my eyes, Or if any spot has stuck to my hands,"
Job,31,8,"Let me sow and another eat, And let my crops be uprooted."
Job,31,9,"“If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or I have lurked at my neighbor’s doorway,"
Job,31,10,"May my wife grind for another, And let others kneel down over her."
Job,31,11,"“For that would be a lustful crime; Moreover, it would be an iniquity punishable by judges."
Job,31,12,"“For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon, And would uproot all my increase."
Job,31,13,"“If I have despised the claim of my male or female slaves When they filed a complaint against me,"
Job,31,14,"What then could I do when God arises? And when He calls me to account, what will I answer Him?"
Job,31,15,"“Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb?"
Job,31,16,"“If I have kept the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the orphan has not shared it"
Job,31,18,"(But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from infancy I guided her),"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering,"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not thanked me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan, Because I saw I had support in the gate,"
Job,31,22,"Let my shoulder fall from the socket, And my arm be broken off at the elbow."
Job,31,23,"“For calamity from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty I can do nothing."
Job,31,24,"“If I have put my confidence in gold, And called fine gold my trust,"
Job,31,25,"If I have gloated because my wealth was great, And because my hand had secured so much;"
Job,31,26,"If I have looked at the sun when it shone Or the moon going in splendor,"
Job,31,27,"And my heart became secretly enticed, And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,"
Job,31,28,"That too would have been an iniquity calling for judgment, For I would have denied God above."
Job,31,29,"“Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, Or exulted when evil befell him?"
Job,31,30,"“No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life in a curse."
Job,31,31,"“Have the men of my tent not said, ‘Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat’?"
Job,31,32,"“The alien has not lodged outside, For I have opened my doors to the traveler."
Job,31,33,"“Have I covered my transgressions like Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,"
Job,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, And kept silent and did not go out of doors?"
Job,31,35,"“Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature; Let the Almighty answer me! And the indictment which my adversary has written,"
Job,31,36,"Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, I would bind it to myself like a crown."
Job,31,37,“I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him.
Job,31,38,"“If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or have caused its owners to lose their lives,"
Job,31,40,"Let briars grow instead of wheat, And stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God."
Job,32,3,"And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.
Job,32,5,And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.
Job,32,6,"So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, “I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think."
Job,32,7,"“I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,"“But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."
Job,32,9,"“The abundant in years may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice."
Job,32,10,"“So I say, ‘Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.’"
Job,32,11,"“Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say."
Job,32,12,"“I even paid close attention to you; Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words."
Job,32,13,"“Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.’"
Job,32,14,"“For he has not arranged his words against me, Nor will I reply to him with your arguments."
Job,32,15,"“They are dismayed, they no longer answer; Words have failed them."
Job,32,16,"“Shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop and no longer answer?"
Job,32,17,"“I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion."
Job,32,18,“For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me.
Job,32,19,"“Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst."
Job,32,20,“Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer.
Job,32,21,"“Let me now be partial to no one, Nor flatter any man."
Job,32,22,"“For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away."
Job,33,1,"“However now, Job, please hear my speech, And listen to all my words."
Job,33,2,"“Behold now, I open my mouth, My tongue in my mouth speaks."
Job,33,3,"“My words are from the uprightness of my heart, And my lips speak knowledge sincerely."
Job,33,4,"“The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
Job,33,5,"“Refute me if you can; Array yourselves before me, take your stand."
Job,33,6,"“Behold, I belong to God like you; I too have been formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"“Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you."
Job,33,8,"“Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words:"
Job,33,9,"‘I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me."
Job,33,10,"‘Behold, He invents pretexts against me; He counts me as His enemy."
Job,33,11,‘He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches all my paths.’
Job,33,12,"“Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, For God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,“Why do you complain against Him That He does not give an account of all His doings?
Job,33,14,"“Indeed God speaks once, Or twice, yet no one notices it."
Job,33,15,"“In a dream, a vision of the night, When sound sleep falls on men, While they slumber in their beds,"
Job,33,16,"Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That He may turn man aside from his conduct, And keep man from pride;"
Job,33,18,"He keeps back his soul from the pit, And his life from passing over into Sheol."
Job,33,19,"“Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with unceasing complaint in his bones;"
Job,33,20,"So that his life loathes bread, And his soul favorite food."
Job,33,21,"“His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones which were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"“Then his soul draws near to the pit, And his life to those who bring death."
Job,33,23,"“If there is an angel as mediator for him, One out of a thousand, To remind a man what is right for him,"
Job,33,24,"Then let him be gracious to him, and say, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom’;"
Job,33,25,"Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor;"
Job,33,26,"Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him, That he may see His face with joy, And He may restore His righteousness to man."
Job,33,27,"“He will sing to men and say, ‘I have sinned and perverted what is right, And it is not proper for me."
Job,33,28,"‘He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit, And my life shall see the light.’"
Job,33,29,"“Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life."
Job,33,31,"“Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; Keep silent, and let me speak."
Job,33,32,"“Then if you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you."
Job,33,33,"“If not, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
Job,34,1,"Then Elihu continued and said,"
Job,34,2,"“Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who know."
Job,34,3,“For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food.
Job,34,4,“Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"“For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, But God has taken away my right;"
Job,34,6,"Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’"
Job,34,7,"“What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water,"
Job,34,8,"Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?"
Job,34,9,"“For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing When he is pleased with God.’"
Job,34,10,"“Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to do wrong."
Job,34,11,"“For He pays a man according to his work, And makes him find it according to his way."
Job,34,12,"“Surely, God will not act wickedly, And the Almighty will not pervert justice."
Job,34,13,“Who gave Him authority over the earth? And who has laid on Him the whole world?
Job,34,14,"“If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,"
Job,34,15,"All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust."
Job,34,16,"“But if you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words."
Job,34,17,"“Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous mighty One,"
Job,34,18,"Who says to a king, ‘Worthless one,’ To nobles, ‘Wicked ones’;"
Job,34,19,"Who shows no partiality to princes Nor regards the rich above the poor, For they all are the work of His hands?"
Job,34,20,"“In a moment they die, and at midnight People are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a hand."
Job,34,21,"“For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps."
Job,34,22,“There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job,34,23,"“For He does not need to consider a man further, That he should go before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,"“He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place."
Job,34,25,"“Therefore He knows their works, And He overthrows them in the night, And they are crushed."
Job,34,26,"“He strikes them like the wicked In a public place,"
Job,34,27,"Because they turned aside from following Him, And had no regard for any of His ways;"
Job,34,28,"So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted—"
Job,34,29,"When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him, That is, in regard to both nation and man?—"
Job,34,30,So that godless men would not rule Nor be snares of the people.
Job,34,31,"“For has anyone said to God, ‘I have borne chastisement; I will not offend anymore;"
Job,34,32,"Teach me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will not do it again’?"
Job,34,33,"“Shall He recompense on your terms, because you have rejected it? For you must choose, and not I; Therefore declare what you know."
Job,34,34,"“Men of understanding will say to me, And a wise man who hears me,"
Job,34,35,"‘Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom."
Job,34,36,"‘Job ought to be tried to the limit, Because he answers like wicked men."
Job,34,37,"‘For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.’”"
Job,35,1,"Then Elihu continued and said,"
Job,35,2,"“Do you think this is according to justice? Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?"
Job,35,3,"“For you say, ‘What advantage will it be to You? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’"
Job,35,4,"“I will answer you, And your friends with you."
Job,35,5,“Look at the heavens and see; And behold the clouds—they are higher than you.
Job,35,6,"“If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him? And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him?"
Job,35,7,"“If you are righteous, what do you give to Him, Or what does He receive from your hand?"
Job,35,8,"“Your wickedness is for a man like yourself, And your righteousness is for a son of man."
Job,35,9,“Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"“But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’
Job,35,12,"“There they cry out, but He does not answer Because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"“Surely God will not listen to an empty cry, Nor will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"“How much less when you say you do not behold Him, The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!"
Job,35,15,"“And now, because He has not visited in His anger, Nor has He acknowledged transgression well,"
Job,35,16,So Job opens his mouth emptily; He multiplies words without knowledge.”
Job,36,1,"Then Elihu continued and said,"
Job,36,2,"“Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there is yet more to be said in God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"“I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,“For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Job,36,5,"“Behold, God is mighty but does not despise any; He is mighty in strength of understanding."
Job,36,6,"“He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted."
Job,36,7,"“He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"“And if they are bound in fetters, And are caught in the cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,"Then He declares to them their work And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves."
Job,36,10,"“He opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from evil."
Job,36,11,"“If they hear and serve Him, They will end their days in prosperity And their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"“But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword And they will die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,“But the godless in heart lay up anger; They do not cry for help when He binds them.
Job,36,14,"“They die in youth, And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes."
Job,36,15,"“He delivers the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ear in time of oppression."
Job,36,16,"“Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress, Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness."
Job,36,17,“But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you.
Job,36,18,“Beware that wrath does not entice you to scoffing; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
Job,36,19,"“Will your riches keep you from distress, Or all the forces of your strength?"
Job,36,20,"“Do not long for the night, When people vanish in their place."
Job,36,21,"“Be careful, do not turn to evil, For you have preferred this to affliction."
Job,36,22,"“Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?"
Job,36,23,"“Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, ‘You have done wrong’?"
Job,36,24,"“Remember that you should exalt His work, Of which men have sung."
Job,36,25,“All men have seen it; Man beholds from afar.

Isaiah,32,14,"Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken. Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks;"
Isaiah,32,15,"Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field, And the fertile field is considered as a forest."
Isaiah,32,16,Then justice will dwell in the wilderness And righteousness will abide in the fertile field.
Isaiah,32,17,"And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever."
Isaiah,32,18,"Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation, And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places;"

Isaiah,33,11,"“You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble; My breath will consume you like a fire."
Isaiah,33,12,"“The peoples will be burned to lime, Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire."
Isaiah,33,13,"“You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, acknowledge My might.”"
Isaiah,33,14,Sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. “Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with continual burning?”
Isaiah,33,15,"He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, He who rejects unjust gain And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil;"
Isaiah,33,16,"He will dwell on the heights, His refuge will be the impregnable rock; His bread will be given him, His water will be sure."
Isaiah,33,17,Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will behold a far-distant land.
Isaiah,33,18,Your heart will meditate on terror: “Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?”
Isaiah,33,19,"You will no longer see a fierce people, A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a stammering tongue which no one understands."
Isaiah,33,20,"Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed habitation, A tent which will not be folded; Its stakes will never be pulled up, Nor any of its cords be torn apart."
Isaiah,33,21,"But there the majestic One, the LORD, will be for us A place of rivers and wide canals On which no boat with oars will go, And on which no mighty ship will pass—"
Isaiah,33,22,"For the LORD is our judge, The LORD is our lawgiver, The LORD is our king; He will save us—"
Isaiah,33,23,"Your tackle hangs slack; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided; The lame will take the plunder."
Isaiah,33,24,"And no resident will say, “I am sick”; The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity."
Isaiah,34,1,"Draw near, O nations, to hear; and listen, O peoples! Let the earth and all it contains hear, and the world and all that springs from it."
Isaiah,34,2,"For the LORD’S indignation is against all the nations, And His wrath against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them, He has given them over to slaughter."
Isaiah,34,3,"So their slain will be thrown out, And their corpses will give off their stench, And the mountains will be drenched with their blood."

Isaiah,34,6,"The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, It is sated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah And a great slaughter in the land of Edom."
Isaiah,34,7,"Wild oxen will also fall with them And young bulls with strong ones; Thus their land will be soaked with blood, And their dust become greasy with fat."
Isaiah,34,8,"For the LORD has a day of vengeance, A year of recompense for the cause of Zion."
Isaiah,34,9,"Its streams will be turned into pitch, And its loose earth into brimstone, And its land will become burning pitch."
Isaiah,34,10,It will not be quenched night or day; Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will be desolate; None will pass through it forever and ever.
Isaiah,34,11,"But pelican and hedgehog will possess it, And owl and raven will dwell in it; And He will stretch over it the line of desolation And the plumb line of emptiness."
Isaiah,34,12,Its nobles—there is no one there Whom they may proclaim king— And all its princes will be nothing.
Isaiah,34,13,"Thorns will come up in its fortified towers, Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; It will also be a haunt of jackals And an abode of ostriches."

Isaiah,35,2,"It will blossom profusely And rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty of our God."
Isaiah,35,3,"Encourage the exhausted, and strengthen the feeble."
Isaiah,35,4,"Say to those with anxious heart, “Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you.”"
Isaiah,35,5,Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
Isaiah,35,6,"Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the Arabah."
Isaiah,35,7,"The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass becomes reeds and rushes."
Isaiah,35,8,"A highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it will be for him who walks that way, And fools will not wander on it."

Isaiah,36,1,"Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them."
Isaiah,36,2,And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller’s field.
Isaiah,36,3,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him."
Isaiah,36,4,"Then Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What is this confidence that you have?"
Isaiah,36,5,"I say, ‘Your counsel and strength for the war are only empty words.’ Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him."
Isaiah,36,7,"But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’?"
Isaiah,36,8,"Now therefore, come make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them."
Isaiah,36,9,How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master’s servants and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah,36,10,"Have I now come up without the LORD’S approval against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”’”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,36,14,"Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you;"
Isaiah,36,15,"nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us, this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,36,16,"Do not listen to Hezekiah,’ for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,"
Isaiah,36,17,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.” Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
Isaiah,36,20,"Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD would deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’”"
Isaiah,36,21,"But they were silent and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh."
Isaiah,37,1,"And when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD."
Isaiah,37,2,"Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke and rejection; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to deliver."
Isaiah,37,4,"Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
Isaiah,37,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah,37,6,"Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me."
Isaiah,37,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.”’”"
Isaiah,37,8,"Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish."
Isaiah,37,9,"When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has come out to fight against you,” and when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,37,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of those nations which my fathers have destroyed deliver them, even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’”"
Isaiah,37,14,"Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD."
Isaiah,37,15,"Hezekiah prayed to the LORD saying,"
Isaiah,37,16,"“O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to reproach the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated all the countries and their lands,"
Isaiah,37,19,"and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, LORD, are God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria,"
Isaiah,37,22,"this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: “She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken her head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem!"
Isaiah,37,23,“Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah,37,24,"“Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest."
Isaiah,37,25,"‘I dug wells and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.’"
Isaiah,37,26,"“Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
Isaiah,37,27,"“Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up."
Isaiah,37,28,“But I know your sitting down And your going out and your coming in And your raging against Me.
Isaiah,37,29,"“Because of your raging against Me And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"“Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah,37,32,For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.”’
Isaiah,37,33,"“Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield, or throw up a siege ramp against it."
Isaiah,37,34,"By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,’ declares the LORD."
Isaiah,37,35,‘For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’”
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead."
Isaiah,37,37,So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh.
Isaiah,37,38,"It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place."
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’”"
Isaiah,38,2,"Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,"
Isaiah,38,3,"and said, “Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,"Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,"
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.”’
Isaiah,38,7,"“This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He has spoken:"
Isaiah,38,8,"Behold, I will cause the shadow on the stairway, which has gone down with the sun on the stairway of Ahaz, to go back ten steps.” So the sun’s shadow went back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down."
Isaiah,38,9,A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
Isaiah,38,10,"I said, “In the middle of my life I am to enter the gates of Sheol; I am to be deprived of the rest of my years.”"
Isaiah,38,11,"I said, “I will not see the LORD, The LORD in the land of the living; I will look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world."
Isaiah,38,12,“Like a shepherd’s tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me; As a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom; From day until night You make an end of me.
Isaiah,38,13,"“I composed my soul until morning. Like a lion—so He breaks all my bones, From day until night You make an end of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"“Like a swallow, like a crane, so I twitter; I moan like a dove; My eyes look wistfully to the heights; O Lord, I am oppressed, be my security."
Isaiah,38,15,"“What shall I say? For He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it; I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul."
Isaiah,38,16,"“O Lord, by these things men live, And in all these is the life of my spirit; O restore me to health and let me live!"
Isaiah,38,17,"“Lo, for my own welfare I had great bitterness; It is You who has kept my soul from the pit of nothingness, For You have cast all my sins behind Your back."
Isaiah,38,18,"“For Sheol cannot thank You, Death cannot praise You; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,19,"“It is the living who give thanks to You, as I do today; A father tells his sons about Your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,20,“The LORD will surely save me; So we will play my songs on stringed instruments All the days of our life at the house of the LORD.”
Isaiah,38,21,"Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"Then Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah was pleased, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and his whole armory and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"He said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of hosts,"
Isaiah,39,6,"‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the LORD."
Isaiah,39,7,"‘And some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away, and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"
Isaiah,39,8,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”"
Isaiah,40,1,"“Comfort, O comfort My people,” says your God."
Isaiah,40,2,"“Speak kindly to Jerusalem; And call out to her, that her warfare has ended, That her iniquity has been removed, That she has received of the LORD’S hand Double for all her sins.”"

Isaiah,40,27,"Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, “My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God”?"
