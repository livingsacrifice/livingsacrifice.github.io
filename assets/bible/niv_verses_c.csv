1 Chronicles,29,27,He ruled over Israel forty years—seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles,29,28,"He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer,"
1 Chronicles,29,30,"together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands."
2 Chronicles,1,1,"Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great."
2 Chronicles,1,2,"Then Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families—"
2 Chronicles,1,3,"and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God’s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the LORD’s servant had made in the wilderness."
2 Chronicles,1,4,"Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,5,"But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there."
2 Chronicles,1,6,Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
2 Chronicles,1,7,"That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”"
2 Chronicles,1,8,"Solomon answered God, “You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth."
2 Chronicles,1,10,"Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?”"
2 Chronicles,1,11,"God said to Solomon, “Since this is your heart’s desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,"
2 Chronicles,1,12,"therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.”"
2 Chronicles,1,13,"Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over Israel."
2 Chronicles,1,14,"Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,15,"The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills."
2 Chronicles,1,16,Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue—the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price.
2 Chronicles,1,17,"They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans."
2 Chronicles,2,1,Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
2 Chronicles,2,2,"He conscripted 70,000 men as carriers and 80,000 as stonecutters in the hills and 3,600 as foremen over them."
2 Chronicles,2,3,Solomon sent this message to Hiram king of Tyre: “Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.
2 Chronicles,2,4,"Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals of the LORD our God. This is a lasting ordinance for Israel."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"“The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,"But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?"
2 Chronicles,2,7,"“Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled workers, whom my father David provided."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"“Send me also cedar, juniper and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber there. My servants will work with yours"
2 Chronicles,2,9,"to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent."
2 Chronicles,2,10,"I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil.”"
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon: “Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king.”"
2 Chronicles,2,12,"And Hiram added: “Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,"“I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill,"
2 Chronicles,2,14,"whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled workers and with those of my lord, David your father."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"“Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised,"
2 Chronicles,2,16,and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them as rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.”
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Solomon took a census of all the foreigners residing in Israel, after the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"He assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them to keep the people working."
2 Chronicles,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David."
2 Chronicles,3,2,He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,3,3,The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard).
2 Chronicles,3,4,The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,3,5,He paneled the main hall with juniper and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.
2 Chronicles,3,6,He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles,3,7,"He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls."
2 Chronicles,3,8,"He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold."
2 Chronicles,3,9,The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.
2 Chronicles,3,10,For the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.
2 Chronicles,3,11,"The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,12,"Similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall."
2 Chronicles,3,14,"He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it."
2 Chronicles,3,15,"For the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital five cubits high."
2 Chronicles,3,16,He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.
2 Chronicles,3,17,"He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz."
2 Chronicles,4,1,"He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high."
2 Chronicles,4,2,"He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls."
2 Chronicles,4,9,"He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,10,"He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner."
2 Chronicles,4,11,And Huram also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God:
2 Chronicles,4,12,the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
2 Chronicles,4,13,"the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);"
2 Chronicles,4,14,the stands with their basins;
2 Chronicles,4,15,the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
2 Chronicles,4,16,"the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of polished bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,17,The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan.
2 Chronicles,4,18,All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze could not be calculated.
2 Chronicles,4,19,Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God’s temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;
2 Chronicles,4,20,"the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;"
2 Chronicles,4,21,the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);
2 Chronicles,4,22,"the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall."
2 Chronicles,5,1,"When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver and gold and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,5,2,"Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the LORD’s covenant from Zion, the City of David."
2 Chronicles,5,3,And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,5,4,"When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark,"
2 Chronicles,5,5,and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carried them up;
2 Chronicles,5,6,"and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted."
2 Chronicles,5,7,"The priests then brought the ark of the LORD’s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim."
2 Chronicles,5,8,The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.
2 Chronicles,5,9,"These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today."
2 Chronicles,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,5,11,"The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions."
2 Chronicles,5,12,"All the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets."
2 Chronicles,5,13,"The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the LORD. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, the singers raised their voices in praise to the LORD and sang: “He is good; his love endures forever.” Then the temple of the LORD was filled with the cloud,"
2 Chronicles,5,14,"and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the temple of God."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;"
2 Chronicles,6,2,"I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.”"
2 Chronicles,6,3,"While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them."
2 Chronicles,6,4,"Then he said: “Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David. For he said,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"‘Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,6,"But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,6,7,"“My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,8,"But the LORD said to my father David, ‘You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name."
2 Chronicles,6,9,"Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’"
2 Chronicles,6,10,"“The LORD has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,11,"There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,6,12,Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
2 Chronicles,6,13,"Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven."
2 Chronicles,6,14,"He said: “LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth—you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way."
2 Chronicles,6,15,You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.
2 Chronicles,6,16,"“Now, LORD, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law, as you have done.’"
2 Chronicles,6,17,"And now, LORD, the God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David come true."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"“But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!"
2 Chronicles,6,19,"Yet, LORD my God, give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence."
2 Chronicles,6,20,"May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place."
2 Chronicles,6,21,"Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive."
2 Chronicles,6,22,"“When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"“When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication before you in this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,25,then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors.
2 Chronicles,6,26,"“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance."
2 Chronicles,6,28,"“When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,"
2 Chronicles,6,29,"and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel—being aware of their afflictions and pains, and spreading out their hands toward this temple—"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know the human heart),"
2 Chronicles,6,31,so that they will fear you and walk in obedience to you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors.
2 Chronicles,6,32,"“As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name."
2 Chronicles,6,34,"“When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,"
2 Chronicles,6,35,"then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause."
2 Chronicles,6,36,"“When they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near;"
2 Chronicles,6,37,"and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly’;"
2 Chronicles,6,38,"and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your Name;"
2 Chronicles,6,39,"then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you."
2 Chronicles,6,40,"“Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"“Now arise, LORD God, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. May your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, may your faithful people rejoice in your goodness."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"LORD God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember the great love promised to David your servant.”"
2 Chronicles,7,1,"When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
2 Chronicles,7,2,The priests could not enter the temple of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled it.
2 Chronicles,7,3,"When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, “He is good; his love endures forever.”"
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
2 Chronicles,7,5,And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.
2 Chronicles,7,6,"The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the LORD’s musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the LORD and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, “His love endures forever.” Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions."
2 Chronicles,7,8,"So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,7,9,"On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more."
2 Chronicles,7,10,"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the LORD had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,7,11,"When Solomon had finished the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the LORD and in his own palace,"
2 Chronicles,7,12,the LORD appeared to him at night and said: “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.
2 Chronicles,7,13,"“When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people,"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
2 Chronicles,7,15,Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
2 Chronicles,7,17,"“As for you, if you walk before me faithfully as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws,"
2 Chronicles,7,18,"I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,7,19,"“But if you turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,"
2 Chronicles,7,20,"then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"This temple will become a heap of rubble. All who pass by will be appalled and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why he brought all this disaster on them.’”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,"At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the LORD and his own palace,"
2 Chronicles,8,2,"Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram had given him, and settled Israelites in them."
2 Chronicles,8,3,Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath.
2 Chronicles,8,5,"He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars,"
2 Chronicles,8,6,"as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled."
2 Chronicles,8,7,"There were still people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these people were not Israelites)."
2 Chronicles,8,8,"Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these people remaining in the land—whom the Israelites had not destroyed—to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day."
2 Chronicles,8,9,"But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers."
2 Chronicles,8,10,They were also King Solomon’s chief officials—two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.
2 Chronicles,8,11,"Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, “My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.”"
2 Chronicles,8,12,"On the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the LORD,"
2 Chronicles,8,13,"according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons and the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day’s requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered."
2 Chronicles,8,15,"They did not deviate from the king’s commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries."
2 Chronicles,8,16,"All Solomon’s work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid until its completion. So the temple of the LORD was finished."
2 Chronicles,8,17,Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
2 Chronicles,8,18,"And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own men, sailors who knew the sea. These, with Solomon’s men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind."
2 Chronicles,9,2,Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,"When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built,"
2 Chronicles,9,4,"the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed."
2 Chronicles,9,5,"She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true."
2 Chronicles,9,6,"But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard."
2 Chronicles,9,7,"How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!"
2 Chronicles,9,8,"Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the LORD your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness.”"
2 Chronicles,9,9,"Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,10,(The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood and precious stones.
2 Chronicles,9,11,"The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.)"
2 Chronicles,9,12,King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
2 Chronicles,9,13,"The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,"
2 Chronicles,9,14,not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the territories brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,15,King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.
2 Chronicles,9,16,"He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred shekels of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon."
2 Chronicles,9,17,Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,9,18,"The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them."
2 Chronicles,9,19,"Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s day."
2 Chronicles,9,21,"The king had a fleet of trading ships manned by Hiram’s servants. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons."
2 Chronicles,9,22,King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
2 Chronicles,9,23,All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
2 Chronicles,9,24,"Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules."
2 Chronicles,9,25,"Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,9,26,"He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,9,27,"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills."
2 Chronicles,9,28,Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries.
2 Chronicles,9,29,"As for the other events of Solomon’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?"
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
2 Chronicles,10,1,"Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king."
2 Chronicles,10,2,"When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people went away."
2 Chronicles,10,6,Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
2 Chronicles,10,9,"He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"The young men who had grown up with him replied, “The people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist."
2 Chronicles,10,11,My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’”
2 Chronicles,10,12,"Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.”"
2 Chronicles,10,13,"The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,"
2 Chronicles,10,14,"he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.”"
2 Chronicles,10,15,"So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: “What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse’s son? To your tents, Israel! Look after your own house, David!” So all the Israelites went home."
2 Chronicles,10,17,"But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them."
2 Chronicles,10,18,"King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered Judah and Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam."
2 Chronicles,11,2,But this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
2 Chronicles,11,3,"“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"‘This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your fellow Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.’” So they obeyed the words of the LORD and turned back from marching against Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah:
2 Chronicles,11,6,"Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine."
2 Chronicles,11,12,"He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his."
2 Chronicles,11,13,The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him.
2 Chronicles,11,14,"The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD"
2 Chronicles,11,15,when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.
2 Chronicles,11,16,"Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, following the ways of David and Solomon during this time."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"Then he married Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"Rehoboam loved Maakah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters."
2 Chronicles,11,22,"Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,"He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them."
2 Chronicles,12,1,"After Rehoboam’s position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel with him abandoned the law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"Because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam."
2 Chronicles,12,3,"With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites that came with him from Egypt,"
2 Chronicles,12,4,he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the LORD says, ‘You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.’”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The LORD is just.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: “Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak."
2 Chronicles,12,8,"They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.”"
2 Chronicles,12,9,"When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
2 Chronicles,12,11,"Whenever the king went to the LORD’s temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD’s anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite."
2 Chronicles,12,14,He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the LORD.
2 Chronicles,12,15,"As for the events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,12,16,Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
2 Chronicles,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah,"
2 Chronicles,13,2,"and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah, a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah went into battle with an army of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!"
2 Chronicles,13,5,"Don’t you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?"
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master."
2 Chronicles,13,7,Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.
2 Chronicles,13,8,"“And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David’s descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"But didn’t you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"“As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them."
2 Chronicles,13,11,Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him.
2 Chronicles,13,12,"God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.”"
2 Chronicles,13,13,"Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets
2 Chronicles,13,15,"and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands."
2 Chronicles,13,17,"Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel’s able men."
2 Chronicles,13,18,"The Israelites were subdued on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages."
2 Chronicles,13,20,Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down and he died.
2 Chronicles,13,21,But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles,13,22,"The other events of Abijah’s reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"And Abijah rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeded him as king, and in his days the country was at peace for ten years."
2 Chronicles,14,2,Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,14,3,"He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles."
2 Chronicles,14,4,"He commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and to obey his laws and commands."
2 Chronicles,14,5,"He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him."
2 Chronicles,14,6,"He built up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years, for the LORD gave him rest."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"“Let us build up these towns,” he said to Judah, “and put walls around them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God; we sought him and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men."
2 Chronicles,14,9,"Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with an army of thousands upon thousands and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, “LORD, there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this vast army. LORD, you are our God; do not let mere mortals prevail against you.”"
2 Chronicles,14,12,"The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,"
2 Chronicles,14,13,and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the LORD and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder.
2 Chronicles,14,14,"They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the LORD had fallen on them. They looted all these villages, since there was much plunder there."
2 Chronicles,14,15,They also attacked the camps of the herders and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,15,1,The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded.
2 Chronicles,15,2,"He went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the law."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found by them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"In those days it was not safe to travel about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was troubling them with every kind of distress."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded.”"
2 Chronicles,15,8,"When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
2 Chronicles,15,11,At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.
2 Chronicles,15,12,"They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul."
2 Chronicles,15,13,"All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"They took an oath to the LORD with loud acclamation, with shouting and with trumpets and horns."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and he was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa’s heart was fully committed to the LORD all his life."
2 Chronicles,15,18,He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
2 Chronicles,15,19,There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2 Chronicles,16,1,In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles,16,2,"Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the LORD’s temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus."
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“Let there be a treaty between me and you,” he said, “as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim and all the store cities of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war.”"
2 Chronicles,16,10,Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.
2 Chronicles,16,11,"The events of Asa’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians."
2 Chronicles,16,13,Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his ancestors.
2 Chronicles,16,14,"They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor."
2 Chronicles,17,1,Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
2 Chronicles,17,3,The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David before him. He did not consult the Baals
2 Chronicles,17,4,but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,5,"The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor."
2 Chronicles,17,6,"His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,7,"In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,8,"With them were certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah—and the priests Elishama and Jehoram."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,"The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats."
2 Chronicles,17,12,Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah
2 Chronicles,17,13,and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,17,14,"Their enrollment by families was as follows: From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;"
2 Chronicles,17,15,"next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;"
2 Chronicles,17,16,"next, Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered himself for the service of the LORD, with 200,000."
2 Chronicles,17,17,"From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;"
2 Chronicles,17,18,"next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle."
2 Chronicles,17,19,"These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage."
2 Chronicles,18,2,Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,3,"Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war.”"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?” “Go,” they answered, “for God will give it into the king’s hand.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied."
2 Chronicles,18,8,"So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”"
2 Chronicles,18,9,"Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,"All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the LORD will give it into the king’s hand.”"
2 Chronicles,18,12,"The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what my God says.”"
2 Chronicles,18,14,"When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?” “Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for they will be given into your hand.”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, ‘These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,"Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left."
2 Chronicles,18,19,"And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’ “One suggested this, and another that."
2 Chronicles,18,20,"Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, ‘I will entice him.’ “‘By what means?’ the LORD asked."
2 Chronicles,18,21,"“‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said. “‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’"
2 Chronicles,18,22,“So now the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you.”
2 Chronicles,18,23,Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked.
2 Chronicles,18,24,"Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son,"
2 Chronicles,18,26,"and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,27,"Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,29,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,"Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,18,31,"When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,"
2 Chronicles,18,32,"for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him."
2 Chronicles,18,33,"But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the breastplate and the scale armor. The king told the chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,"All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died."
2 Chronicles,19,1,"When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,19,2,"Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is on you."
2 Chronicles,19,3,"There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God.”"
2 Chronicles,19,4,"Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,19,5,"He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,19,6,"He told them, “Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the LORD, who is with you whenever you give a verdict."
2 Chronicles,19,7,"Now let the fear of the LORD be on you. Judge carefully, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.”"
2 Chronicles,19,8,"In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,9,He gave them these orders: “You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,19,10,"In every case that comes before you from your people who live in the cities—whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or regulations—you are to warn them not to sin against the LORD; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your people. Do this, and you will not sin."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"“Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king, and the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage, and may the LORD be with those who do well.”"
2 Chronicles,20,1,"After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,20,2,"Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi)."
2 Chronicles,20,3,"Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah."
2 Chronicles,20,4,"The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him."
2 Chronicles,20,5,Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new courtyard
2 Chronicles,20,6,"and said: “LORD, the God of our ancestors, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you."
2 Chronicles,20,7,"Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?"
2 Chronicles,20,8,"They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying,"
2 Chronicles,20,9,"‘If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.’"
2 Chronicles,20,10,"“But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them."
2 Chronicles,20,11,See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.
2 Chronicles,20,12,"Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.”"
2 Chronicles,20,13,"All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,14,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly."
2 Chronicles,20,15,"He said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s."
2 Chronicles,20,16,"Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel."
2 Chronicles,20,17,"You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the LORD will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with you.’”"
2 Chronicles,20,18,"Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,19,"Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice."
2 Chronicles,20,20,"Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful.”"
2 Chronicles,20,21,"After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: “Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever.”"
2 Chronicles,20,22,"As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated."
2 Chronicles,20,23,"The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another."
2 Chronicles,20,24,"When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped."
2 Chronicles,20,25,"So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value—more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it."
2 Chronicles,20,26,"On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is called the Valley of Berakah to this day."
2 Chronicles,20,27,"Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies."
2 Chronicles,20,28,They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and lyres and trumpets.
2 Chronicles,20,29,The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles,20,30,"And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side."
2 Chronicles,20,31,"So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi."
2 Chronicles,20,32,He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,20,33,"The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,20,34,"The other events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel."
2 Chronicles,20,35,"Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, whose ways were wicked."
2 Chronicles,20,36,"He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion Geber,"
2 Chronicles,20,37,"Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made.” The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade."
2 Chronicles,21,1,Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
2 Chronicles,21,2,"Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father’s kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the officials of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,5,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years."
2 Chronicles,21,6,"He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,21,7,"Nevertheless, because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever."
2 Chronicles,21,8,"In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king."
2 Chronicles,21,9,"So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night."
2 Chronicles,21,10,"To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,21,11,He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.
2 Chronicles,21,12,"Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: “This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,21,13,"But you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your own family, men who were better than you."
2 Chronicles,21,14,"So now the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow."
2 Chronicles,21,15,"You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.’”"
2 Chronicles,21,16,The LORD aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.
2 Chronicles,21,17,"They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king’s palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah, the youngest."
2 Chronicles,21,18,"After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels."
2 Chronicles,21,19,"In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no funeral fire in his honor, as they had for his predecessors."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one’s regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,22,1,"The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign."
2 Chronicles,22,2,"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri."
2 Chronicles,22,3,"He too followed the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him to act wickedly."
2 Chronicles,22,4,"He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father’s death they became his advisers, to his undoing."
2 Chronicles,22,5,He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
2 Chronicles,22,6,so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.
2 Chronicles,22,7,"Through Ahaziah’s visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid the child from Athaliah so she could not kill him."
2 Chronicles,22,12,He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zikri."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,23,3,"the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, “The king’s son shall reign, as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"Now this is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,"
2 Chronicles,23,5,"a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the others are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,6,"No one is to enter the temple of the LORD except the priests and Levites on duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the others are to observe the LORD’s command not to enter."
2 Chronicles,23,7,"The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each with weapon in hand. Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.”"
2 Chronicles,23,8,The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
2 Chronicles,23,9,Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.
2 Chronicles,23,10,"He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king—near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live the king!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,13,"She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and musicians with their instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: “Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Jehoiada then made a covenant that he, the people and the king would be the LORD’s people."
2 Chronicles,23,17,All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the LORD in the hands of the Levitical priests, to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the LORD as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered."
2 Chronicles,23,19,He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the LORD’s temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.
2 Chronicles,23,20,"He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the LORD. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne."
2 Chronicles,23,21,"All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was calm, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword."
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba."
2 Chronicles,24,2,Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest.
2 Chronicles,24,3,"Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters."
2 Chronicles,24,4,Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,24,5,"He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, “Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.” But the Levites did not act at once."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the tent of the covenant law?”"
2 Chronicles,24,7,Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.
2 Chronicles,24,8,"At the king’s command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,9,A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles,24,10,"All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king’s officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD’s temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the LORD’s temple: articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,15,"Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty."
2 Chronicles,24,16,"He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple."
2 Chronicles,24,17,"After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God’s anger came on Judah and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you disobey the LORD’s commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.’”"
2 Chronicles,24,21,"But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,24,22,"King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, “May the LORD see this and call you to account.”"
2 Chronicles,24,23,"At the turn of the year, the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their ancestors, judgment was executed on Joash."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman."
2 Chronicles,24,27,"The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king."
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly."
2 Chronicles,25,3,"After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"Yet he did not put their children to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded: “Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor children be put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.”"
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men fit for military service, able to handle the spear and shield."
2 Chronicles,25,6,He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But a man of God came to him and said, “Your Majesty, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the LORD is not with Israel—not with any of the people of Ephraim."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow.”"
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?” The man of God replied, “The LORD can give you much more than that.”"
2 Chronicles,25,10,So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.
2 Chronicles,25,11,"Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
2 Chronicles,25,14,"When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"The anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why do you consult this people’s gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"While he was still speaking, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?” So the prophet stopped but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: “Come, let us face each other in battle.”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?”"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might deliver them into the hands of Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom."
2 Chronicles,25,21,So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
2 Chronicles,25,22,"Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home."
2 Chronicles,25,23,"Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about four hundred cubits long."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
2 Chronicles,25,26,"As for the other events of Amaziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
2 Chronicles,25,27,"From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,He was brought back by horse and was buried with his ancestors in the City of Judah.
2 Chronicles,26,1,"Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah."
2 Chronicles,26,2,He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his ancestors.
2 Chronicles,26,3,"Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,26,4,"He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done."
2 Chronicles,26,5,"He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines."
2 Chronicles,26,7,God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.
2 Chronicles,26,8,"The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful."
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials."
2 Chronicles,26,12,"The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600."
2 Chronicles,26,13,"Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies."
2 Chronicles,26,14,"Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army."
2 Chronicles,26,15,"In Jerusalem he made devices invented for use on the towers and on the corner defenses so that soldiers could shoot arrows and hurl large stones from the walls. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,17,Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in.
2 Chronicles,26,18,"They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God.”"
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD’s temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him."
2 Chronicles,26,21,"King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house—leprous, and banned from the temple of the LORD. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"The other events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"Uzziah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in a cemetery that belonged to the kings, for people said, “He had leprosy.” And Jotham his son succeeded him as king."
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done, but unlike him he did not enter the temple of the LORD. The people, however, continued their corrupt practices."
2 Chronicles,27,3,Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the LORD and did extensive work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
2 Chronicles,27,4,He built towns in the hill country of Judah and forts and towers in the wooded areas.
2 Chronicles,27,5,"Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand cors of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years."
2 Chronicles,27,6,Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,27,7,"The other events in Jotham’s reign, including all his wars and the other things he did, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years."
2 Chronicles,27,9,Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,2,He followed the ways of the kings of Israel and also made idols for worshiping the Baals.
2 Chronicles,28,3,"He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his children in the fire, engaging in the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree."
2 Chronicles,28,5,"Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hands of the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him."
2 Chronicles,28,6,"In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah—because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"Zikri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"The men of Israel took captive from their fellow Israelites who were from Judah two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, “Because the LORD, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren’t you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Now listen to me! Send back your fellow Israelites you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD’s fierce anger rests on you.”"
2 Chronicles,28,12,"Then some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those who were arriving from the war."
2 Chronicles,28,13,"“You must not bring those prisoners here,” they said, “or we will be guilty before the LORD. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"The men designated by name took the prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow Israelites at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
2 Chronicles,28,17,"The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners,"
2 Chronicles,28,18,"while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth, as well as Soko, Timnah and Gimzo, with their surrounding villages."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"The LORD had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,20,"Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him, but he gave him trouble instead of help."
2 Chronicles,28,21,"Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the officials and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help him."
2 Chronicles,28,22,In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.
2 Chronicles,28,23,"He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him; for he thought, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me.” But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,24,Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and cut them in pieces. He shut the doors of the LORD’s temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,28,25,"In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"The other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple of the LORD and repaired them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,"He brought in the priests and the Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side"
2 Chronicles,29,5,"and said: “Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the LORD, the God of your ancestors. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary."
2 Chronicles,29,6,Our parents were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the LORD our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the LORD’s dwelling place and turned their backs on him.
2 Chronicles,29,7,They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles,29,8,"Therefore, the anger of the LORD has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with your own eyes."
2 Chronicles,29,9,This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity.
2 Chronicles,29,10,"Now I intend to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn incense.”"
2 Chronicles,29,12,"Then these Levites set to work: from the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;"
2 Chronicles,29,13,"from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;"
2 Chronicles,29,14,"from the descendants of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; from the descendants of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel."
2 Chronicles,29,15,"When they had assembled their fellow Levites and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the LORD, as the king had ordered, following the word of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,16,The priests went into the sanctuary of the LORD to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the LORD’s temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the LORD. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles,29,17,"They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: “We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles."
2 Chronicles,29,19,We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the LORD’s altar.”
2 Chronicles,29,20,Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,29,21,"They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and splashed their blood against the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,"The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them."
2 Chronicles,29,24,"The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"He stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king’s seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"So the Levites stood ready with David’s instruments, and the priests with their trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the musicians played and the trumpets sounded. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,30,King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed down and worshiped.
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah said, “You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs—all of them for burnt offerings to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,33,The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.
2 Chronicles,29,34,"The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the LORD was reestablished."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,2,The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles,30,3,They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,30,4,The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"At the king’s command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read: “People of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their ancestors, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Do not be stiff-necked, as your ancestors were; submit to the LORD. Come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"If you return to the LORD, then your fellow Israelites and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will return to this land, for the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him.”"
2 Chronicles,30,10,"The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but people scorned and ridiculed them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,12,"Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,13,A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
2 Chronicles,30,14,They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles,30,15,They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,30,16,Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them by the Levites.
2 Chronicles,30,17,"Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the LORD, who is good, pardon everyone"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"who sets their heart on seeking God—the LORD, the God of their ancestors—even if they are not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary.”"
2 Chronicles,30,20,And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,"The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests praised the LORD every day with resounding instruments dedicated to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the LORD. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised the LORD, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,30,23,The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully.
2 Chronicles,30,24,"Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves."
2 Chronicles,30,25,"The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and also those who resided in Judah."
2 Chronicles,30,26,"There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,27,"The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the LORD’s dwelling."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals as written in the Law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,4,He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,31,5,"As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything."
2 Chronicles,31,6,"The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps."
2 Chronicles,31,7,They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and blessed his people Israel."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps;
2 Chronicles,31,10,"and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, “Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the LORD has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over.”"
2 Chronicles,31,11,"Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the LORD, and this was done."
2 Chronicles,31,12,"Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank."
2 Chronicles,31,13,"Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God."
2 Chronicles,31,14,"Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the LORD and also the consecrated gifts."
2 Chronicles,31,15,"Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike."
2 Chronicles,31,16,"In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter the temple of the LORD to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions."
2 Chronicles,31,17,"And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions."
2 Chronicles,31,18,"They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves."
2 Chronicles,31,19,"As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites."
2 Chronicles,31,20,"This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,31,21,"In everything that he undertook in the service of God’s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered."
2 Chronicles,32,1,"After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself."
2 Chronicles,32,2,"When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,32,3,"he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him."
2 Chronicles,32,4,They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said.
2 Chronicles,32,5,Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.
2 Chronicles,32,6,He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:
2 Chronicles,32,7,"“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him."
2 Chronicles,32,8,"With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said."
2 Chronicles,32,9,"Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:"
2 Chronicles,32,10,"“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?"
2 Chronicles,32,11,"When Hezekiah says, ‘The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,’ he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst."
2 Chronicles,32,12,"Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god’s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it’?"
2 Chronicles,32,13,“Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?
2 Chronicles,32,14,Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?
2 Chronicles,32,15,"Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!”"
2 Chronicles,32,16,Sennacherib’s officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles,32,17,"The king also wrote letters ridiculing the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: “Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.”"
2 Chronicles,32,18,"Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city."

2 Chronicles,32,20,King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.
2 Chronicles,32,21,"And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons, his own flesh and blood, cut him down with the sword."
2 Chronicles,32,22,So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them on every side.
2 Chronicles,32,23,Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.

2 Chronicles,32,25,But Hezekiah’s heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the LORD’s wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,32,26,"Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the LORD’s wrath did not come on them during the days of Hezekiah."
2 Chronicles,32,27,"Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables."

2 Chronicles,33,12,In his distress he sought the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors.
2 Chronicles,33,13,"And when he prayed to him, the LORD was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God."
2 Chronicles,33,14,"Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah."

2 Chronicles,34,10,Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the LORD’s temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.
2 Chronicles,34,11,"They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin."
2 Chronicles,34,12,"The workers labored faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites—all who were skilled in playing musical instruments—"
2 Chronicles,34,13,"had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and gatekeepers."

2 Chronicles,34,15,"Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD.” He gave it to Shaphan."

2 Chronicles,34,21,“Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD’s anger that is poured out on us because those who have gone before us have not kept the word of the LORD; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book.”
2 Chronicles,34,22,"Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter."
2 Chronicles,34,23,"She said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,"
2 Chronicles,34,24,‘This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles,34,25,"Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made, my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.’"
2 Chronicles,34,26,"Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:"
2 Chronicles,34,27,"Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD."
2 Chronicles,34,28,"Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.’” So they took her answer back to the king."
2 Chronicles,34,29,Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,30,"He went up to the temple of the LORD with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,34,31,"The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD—to follow the LORD and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book."

2 Chronicles,35,9,"Also Konaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites."

2 Chronicles,35,14,"After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king’s seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them."
2 Chronicles,35,16,"So at that time the entire service of the LORD was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had ordered."

2 Chronicles,35,19,This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.
2 Chronicles,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle."
2 Chronicles,35,21,"But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, “What quarrel is there, king of Judah, between you and me? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you.”"
2 Chronicles,35,22,"Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Necho had said at God’s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo."

Ezra,3,3,"Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening sacrifices."
Ezra,3,4,"Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Festival of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day."
Ezra,3,5,"After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred festivals of the LORD, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, though the foundation of the LORD’s temple had not yet been laid."
Ezra,3,7,"Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and olive oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak and the rest of the people (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work. They appointed Levites twenty years old and older to supervise the building of the house of the LORD."
Ezra,3,9,Joshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers—all Levites—joined together in supervising those working on the house of God.
Ezra,3,10,"When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their places to praise the LORD, as prescribed by David king of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD: “He is good; his love toward Israel endures forever.” And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy."
Ezra,3,13,"No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away."
Ezra,4,1,"When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,"
Ezra,4,2,"they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, “Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, “You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.
Ezra,4,5,They bribed officials to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra,4,6,"At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language."
Ezra,4,8,Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
Ezra,4,9,"Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates—the judges, officials and administrators over the people from Persia, Uruk and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,"
Ezra,4,10,and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.
Ezra,4,11,"(This is a copy of the letter they sent him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants in Trans-Euphrates:"
Ezra,4,12,The king should know that the people who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.
Ezra,4,13,"Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and eventually the royal revenues will suffer."
Ezra,4,14,"Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,"
Ezra,4,15,"so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place with a long history of sedition. That is why this city was destroyed."
Ezra,4,16,"We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates."
Ezra,4,17,"The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings."
Ezra,4,18,The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.
Ezra,4,19,"I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition."
Ezra,4,20,"Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them."
Ezra,4,21,"Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order."
Ezra,4,22,"Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?"
Ezra,4,23,"As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop."
Ezra,4,24,Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra,5,1,"Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them."
Ezra,5,2,"Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, supporting them."
Ezra,5,3,"At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?”"
Ezra,5,4,"They also asked, “What are the names of those who are constructing this building?”"
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received."
Ezra,5,6,"This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius."
Ezra,5,7,The report they sent him read as follows: To King Darius: Cordial greetings.
Ezra,5,8,"The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction."
Ezra,5,9,"We questioned the elders and asked them, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?”"
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information."
Ezra,5,11,"This is the answer they gave us: “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished."
Ezra,5,12,"But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon."
Ezra,5,13,"“However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God."
Ezra,5,14,"He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon. Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor,"
Ezra,5,15,"and he told him, ‘Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.’"
Ezra,5,16,“So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished.”
Ezra,5,17,"Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter."
Ezra,6,1,"King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon."
Ezra,6,2,"A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it: Memorandum:"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide,"
Ezra,6,4,with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.
Ezra,6,5,"Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God."
Ezra,6,6,"Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you other officials of that province, stay away from there."
Ezra,6,7,Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God: Their expenses are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop."
Ezra,6,9,"Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and olive oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must be given them daily without fail,"
Ezra,6,10,so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
Ezra,6,11,"Furthermore, I decree that if anyone defies this edict, a beam is to be pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it. And for this crime their house is to be made a pile of rubble."
Ezra,6,12,"May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence."
Ezra,6,13,"Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence."
Ezra,6,14,"So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,"The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius."
Ezra,6,16,"Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,"On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover."
Ezra,6,20,"The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their relatives the priests and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the LORD, the God of Israel."
Ezra,6,22,"For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because the LORD had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
Ezra,7,2,"the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
Ezra,7,3,"the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
Ezra,7,4,"the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
Ezra,7,5,"the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest—"
Ezra,7,6,"this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him."
Ezra,7,7,"Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
Ezra,7,8,Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
Ezra,7,9,"He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel:"
Ezra,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, teacher of the Law of the God of heaven: Greetings."
Ezra,7,13,"Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you, may go."
Ezra,7,14,"You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand."
Ezra,7,15,"Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,16,"together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,17,"With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God."
Ezra,7,19,Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God.
Ezra,7,20,"And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury."
Ezra,7,21,"Now I, King Artaxerxes, decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you—"
Ezra,7,22,"up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons?"
Ezra,7,24,"You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God."
Ezra,7,25,"And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them."
Ezra,7,26,"Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment."
Ezra,7,27,"Praise be to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the king’s heart to bring honor to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem in this way"
Ezra,7,28,"and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king’s powerful officials. Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
Ezra,8,2,"of the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; of the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; of the descendants of David, Hattush"
Ezra,8,3,"of the descendants of Shekaniah; of the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;"
Ezra,8,4,"of the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;"
Ezra,8,5,"of the descendants of Zattu, Shekaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;"
Ezra,8,6,"of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;"
Ezra,8,7,"of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;"
Ezra,8,8,"of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;"
Ezra,8,9,"of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;"
Ezra,8,10,"of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;"
Ezra,8,11,"of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;"
Ezra,8,12,"of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;"
Ezra,8,13,"of the descendants of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;"
Ezra,8,14,"of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zakkur, and with them 70 men."
Ezra,8,15,"I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there."
Ezra,8,16,"So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,"
Ezra,8,17,"and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,18,"Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all;"
Ezra,8,19,"and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all."
Ezra,8,20,They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.
Ezra,8,21,"There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions."
Ezra,8,22,"I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.”"
Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer."
Ezra,8,24,"Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,"
Ezra,8,25,"and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,26,"I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,"
Ezra,8,27,"20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your ancestors."
Ezra,8,29,Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel.”
Ezra,8,30,Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
Ezra,8,31,"On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way."
Ezra,8,32,"So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days."
Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui."
Ezra,8,34,"Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time."
Ezra,8,35,"Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezra,8,36,"They also delivered the king’s orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God."
Ezra,9,1,"After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.”"
Ezra,9,3,"When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled."
Ezra,9,4,Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
Ezra,9,5,"Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God"
Ezra,9,6,"and prayed: “I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today."
Ezra,9,8,"“But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage."
Ezra,9,9,"Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"“But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands"
Ezra,9,11,you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.
Ezra,9,12,"Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’"
Ezra,9,13,"“What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this."
Ezra,9,14,"Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?"
Ezra,9,15,"LORD, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.”"
Ezra,10,1,"While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel."
Ezra,10,3,"Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law."
Ezra,10,4,"Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.”"
Ezra,10,5,So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles."
Ezra,10,7,A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.
Ezra,10,8,"Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles."
Ezra,10,9,"Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt."
Ezra,10,11,"Now honor the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.”"
Ezra,10,12,The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say.
Ezra,10,13,"But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing."
Ezra,10,14,"Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.”"
Ezra,10,15,"Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this."
Ezra,10,16,"So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,"
Ezra,10,17,and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezra,10,18,"Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: From the descendants of Joshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,19,"(They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)"
Ezra,10,20,From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
Ezra,10,21,"From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah."
Ezra,10,22,"From the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah."
Ezra,10,23,"Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah and Eliezer."
Ezra,10,24,"From the musicians: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri."
Ezra,10,25,"And among the other Israelites: From the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malkijah and Benaiah."

Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,3,"They said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"Then I said: “LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father’s family, have committed against you."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"“Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,"
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.’"
Nehemiah,1,10,"“They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand."
Nehemiah,1,11,"Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.” I was cupbearer to the king."
Nehemiah,2,1,"In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before,"
Nehemiah,2,2,"so the king asked me, “Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.” I was very much afraid,"
Nehemiah,2,3,"but I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"The king said to me, “What is it you want?” Then I prayed to the God of heaven,"
Nehemiah,2,5,"and I answered the king, “If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?” It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"I also said to him, “If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?"
Nehemiah,2,8,"And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests."
Nehemiah,2,9,So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites."
Nehemiah,2,11,"I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days"
Nehemiah,2,12,I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.
Nehemiah,2,13,"By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;"
Nehemiah,2,15,"so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate."
Nehemiah,2,16,"The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me. They replied, “Let us start rebuilding.” So they began this good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What is this you are doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,"Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel."
Nehemiah,3,2,"The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zakkur son of Imri built next to them."
Nehemiah,3,3,The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place.
Nehemiah,3,4,"Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next to him Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and next to him Zadok son of Baana also made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,5,"The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors."
Nehemiah,3,6,The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place.
Nehemiah,3,7,"Next to them, repairs were made by men from Gibeon and Mizpah—Melatiah of Gibeon and Jadon of Meronoth—places under the authority of the governor of Trans-Euphrates."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the next section; and Hananiah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs next to that. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section."
Nehemiah,3,10,"Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs next to him."
Nehemiah,3,11,Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens.
Nehemiah,3,12,"Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section with the help of his daughters."
Nehemiah,3,13,The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place. They also repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
Nehemiah,3,14,"The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Rekab, ruler of the district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place."
Nehemiah,3,15,"The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Kol-Hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it over and putting its doors and bolts and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam, by the King’s Garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David."
Nehemiah,3,16,"Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Heroes."
Nehemiah,3,17,"Next to him, the repairs were made by the Levites under Rehum son of Bani. Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district."
Nehemiah,3,18,"Next to him, the repairs were made by their fellow Levites under Binnui son of Henadad, ruler of the other half-district of Keilah."
Nehemiah,3,19,"Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section, from a point facing the ascent to the armory as far as the angle of the wall."
Nehemiah,3,20,"Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the angle to the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
Nehemiah,3,21,"Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another section, from the entrance of Eliashib’s house to the end of it."
Nehemiah,3,22,The repairs next to him were made by the priests from the surrounding region.
Nehemiah,3,23,"Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house; and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house."
Nehemiah,3,24,"Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah’s house to the angle and the corner,"
Nehemiah,3,25,"and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the angle and the tower projecting from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh"
Nehemiah,3,26,and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
Nehemiah,3,27,"Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel."
Nehemiah,3,28,"Above the Horse Gate, the priests made repairs, each in front of his own house."
Nehemiah,3,29,"Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Next to him, Shemaiah son of Shekaniah, the guard at the East Gate, made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,30,"Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs opposite his living quarters."
Nehemiah,3,31,"Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the room above the corner;"
Nehemiah,3,32,and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
Nehemiah,4,1,"When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews,"
Nehemiah,4,2,"and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, “What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble—burned as they are?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, “What they are building—even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.
Nehemiah,4,9,But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
Nehemiah,4,10,"Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Also our enemies said, “Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah"
Nehemiah,4,17,"who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,"
Nehemiah,4,18,and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
Nehemiah,4,19,"Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall."
Nehemiah,4,20,"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out."
Nehemiah,4,22,"At that time I also said to the people, “Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water."
Nehemiah,5,1,Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews.
Nehemiah,5,2,"Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Still others were saying, “We have had to borrow money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,"When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry."
Nehemiah,5,7,"I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, “You are charging your own people interest!” So I called together a large meeting to deal with them"
Nehemiah,5,8,"and said: “As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!” They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest!
Nehemiah,5,11,"Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"“We will give it back,” they said. “And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.” Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!” At this the whole assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor."
Nehemiah,5,15,But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.
Nehemiah,5,16,"Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates—"
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.” But they were scheming to harm me;"
Nehemiah,6,3,so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?”
Nehemiah,6,4,"Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter"
Nehemiah,6,6,"in which was written: “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king"
Nehemiah,6,7,"and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.”
Nehemiah,6,9,"They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.” But I prayed, “Now strengthen my hands.”"
Nehemiah,6,10,"One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the Levites were appointed."
Nehemiah,7,2,"I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt."
Nehemiah,7,5,"So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,"
Nehemiah,7,7,"in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum and Baanah): The list of the men of Israel:"

Nehemiah,8,1,"all the people came together as one in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the teacher of the Law to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded for Israel."
Nehemiah,8,2,"So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand."
Nehemiah,8,3,"He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,4,"Ezra the teacher of the Law stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam."
Nehemiah,8,5,"Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up."
Nehemiah,8,6,"Ezra praised the LORD, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, “Amen! Amen!” Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there."
Nehemiah,8,8,"They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read."
Nehemiah,8,9,"Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher of the Law, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, “This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”"
Nehemiah,8,11,"The Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for this is a holy day. Do not grieve.”"
Nehemiah,8,12,"Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the teacher to give attention to the words of the Law."
Nehemiah,8,14,"They found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month"
Nehemiah,8,15,"and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make temporary shelters”—as it is written."
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim."
Nehemiah,8,17,"The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly."
Nehemiah,9,1,"On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads."
Nehemiah,9,2,Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
Nehemiah,9,3,"They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani. They cried out with loud voices to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah—said: “Stand up and praise the LORD your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting.” “Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise."
Nehemiah,9,6,"You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you."
Nehemiah,9,7,"“You are the LORD God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,“You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea.
Nehemiah,9,10,"You sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take."
Nehemiah,9,13,"“You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good."
Nehemiah,9,14,"You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,9,15,In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.
Nehemiah,9,16,"“But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands."
Nehemiah,9,17,"They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them,"
Nehemiah,9,18,"even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, ‘This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,’ or when they committed awful blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,19,"“Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."
Nehemiah,9,22,"“You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess."
Nehemiah,9,24,"Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you gave the Canaanites into their hands, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased."
Nehemiah,9,25,"They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"“But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"“But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time."
Nehemiah,9,29,"“You warned them in order to turn them back to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, of which you said, ‘The person who obeys them will live by them.’ Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen."
Nehemiah,9,30,"For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples."
Nehemiah,9,31,"But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"“Now therefore, our God, the great God, mighty and awesome, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes—the hardship that has come on us, on our kings and leaders, on our priests and prophets, on our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today."
Nehemiah,9,33,"In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep."
Nehemiah,9,35,"Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways."
Nehemiah,9,36,"“But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces."
Nehemiah,9,37,"Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"“In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it.”"

Nehemiah,12,28,"The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem—from the villages of the Netophathites,"

Nehemiah,12,44,"At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes.

Nehemiah,12,45,"They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon."

Nehemiah,12,47,"So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.)"
Nehemiah,13,3,"When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah,"
Nehemiah,13,5,"and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission"
Nehemiah,13,7,and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah,13,8,I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.
Nehemiah,13,9,"I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields."
Nehemiah,13,11,"So I rebuked the officials and asked them, “Why is the house of God neglected?” Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts."
Nehemiah,13,12,"All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil into the storerooms."
Nehemiah,13,13,"I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day."
Nehemiah,13,16,People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah.
Nehemiah,13,17,"I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this wicked thing you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Didn’t your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.”"
Nehemiah,13,19,"When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,13,21,"But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you.” From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love."
Nehemiah,13,23,"Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,"Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah."
Nehemiah,13,25,"I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God’s name and said: “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women."
Nehemiah,13,27,Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?”
Nehemiah,13,28,One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task."
Nehemiah,13,31,"I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with favor, my God."
Esther,1,1,"This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush:"
Esther,1,2,"At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,"
Esther,1,3,"and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present."
Esther,1,4,For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.
Esther,1,5,"When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa."
Esther,1,6,"The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones."
Esther,1,7,"Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king’s liberality."
Esther,1,8,"By the king’s command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished."
Esther,1,9,Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas—"
Esther,1,11,"to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at."
Esther,1,12,"But when the attendants delivered the king’s command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger."
Esther,1,13,"Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times"
Esther,1,14,"and were closest to the king—Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memukan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom."
Esther,1,15,"“According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?” he asked. “She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.”"
Esther,1,16,"Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes."
Esther,1,17,"For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.’"
Esther,1,18,This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen’s conduct will respond to all the king’s nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.
Esther,1,19,"“Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she."
Esther,1,20,"Then when the king’s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest.”"
Esther,1,21,"The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memukan proposed."
Esther,1,22,"He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue."
Esther,2,1,"Later when King Xerxes’ fury had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her."
Esther,2,2,"Then the king’s personal attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king."
Esther,2,3,"Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them."
Esther,2,4,"Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it."
Esther,2,5,"Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,"
Esther,2,6,"who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah."
Esther,2,7,"Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died."
Esther,2,8,"When the king’s order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem."
Esther,2,9,She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king’s palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem.
Esther,2,10,"Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so."
Esther,2,11,Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
Esther,2,12,"Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics."
Esther,2,13,And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name."
Esther,2,15,"When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her."
Esther,2,16,"She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,"Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther,2,18,"And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality."
Esther,2,19,"When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up."
Esther,2,21,"During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes."
Esther,2,22,"But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai."
Esther,2,23,"And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were impaled on poles. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles."
Esther,3,2,"All the royal officials at the king’s gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor."
Esther,3,3,"Then the royal officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”"
Esther,3,4,"Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged."
Esther,3,6,"Yet having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes."
Esther,3,7,"In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate. Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them."
Esther,3,9,"If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will give ten thousand talents of silver to the king’s administrators for the royal treasury.”"
Esther,3,10,"So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews."
Esther,3,11,"“Keep the money,” the king said to Haman, “and do with the people as you please.”"
Esther,3,12,"Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring."
Esther,3,13,"Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods."
Esther,3,14,A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.
Esther,3,15,"The couriers went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly."
Esther,4,2,"But he went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it."
Esther,4,3,"In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"When Esther’s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them."
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why."
Esther,4,6,So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate.
Esther,4,7,"Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews."
Esther,4,8,"He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to instruct her to go into the king’s presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people."
Esther,4,9,Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
Esther,4,10,"Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,"
Esther,4,11,“All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.”
Esther,4,12,"When Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai,"
Esther,4,13,he sent back this answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape.
Esther,4,14,"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”"
Esther,4,15,Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
Esther,4,16,"“Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”"
Esther,4,17,So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s instructions.
Esther,5,1,"On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance."
Esther,5,2,"When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"Then the king asked, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.”"
Esther,5,4,"“If it pleases the king,” replied Esther, “let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.”"
Esther,5,5,"“Bring Haman at once,” the king said, “so that we may do what Esther asks.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, “Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”"
Esther,5,7,"Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this:"
Esther,5,8,"If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”"
Esther,5,9,"Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife,"
Esther,5,11,"Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials."
Esther,5,12,"“And that’s not all,” Haman added. “I’m the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow."
Esther,5,13,But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate.”
Esther,5,14,"His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, reaching to a height of fifty cubits, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai impaled on it. Then go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself.” This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the pole set up."
Esther,6,1,"That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him."
Esther,6,2,"It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes."
Esther,6,3,"“What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king asked. “Nothing has been done for him,” his attendants answered."
Esther,6,4,"The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him."
Esther,6,5,"His attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.” “Bring him in,” the king ordered."
Esther,6,6,"When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?” Now Haman thought to himself, “Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?”"
Esther,6,7,"So he answered the king, “For the man the king delights to honor,"
Esther,6,8,"have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head."
Esther,6,9,"Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!’”"
Esther,6,10,"“Go at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.”"
Esther,6,11,"So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!”"
Esther,6,12,"Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief,"
Esther,6,13,"and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him—you will surely come to ruin!”"
Esther,6,14,"While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,"So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet,"
Esther,7,2,"and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king again asked, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”"
Esther,7,3,"Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request."
Esther,7,4,"For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.”"
Esther,7,5,"King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is he—the man who has dared to do such a thing?”"
Esther,7,6,"Esther said, “An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!” Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen."
Esther,7,7,"The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life."
Esther,7,8,"Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, “Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?” As soon as the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face."
Esther,7,9,"Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits stands by Haman’s house. He had it set up for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.” The king said, “Impale him on it!”"
Esther,7,10,So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the king’s fury subsided.
Esther,8,1,"That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her."
Esther,8,2,"The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate."
Esther,8,3,"Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.
Esther,8,5,"“If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces."
Esther,8,6,For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?”
Esther,8,7,"King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up."
Esther,8,8,"Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.”"
Esther,8,9,"At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush. These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language."
Esther,8,10,"Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king."
Esther,8,11,"The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children, and to plunder the property of their enemies."
Esther,8,12,"The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar."
Esther,8,13,A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
Esther,8,14,"The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa."
Esther,8,15,"When Mordecai left the king’s presence, he was wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration."
Esther,8,16,"For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor."
Esther,8,17,"In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them."
Esther,9,1,"On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them."
Esther,9,2,"The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them."
Esther,9,3,"And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king’s administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them."
Esther,9,4,"Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful."
Esther,9,5,"The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them."
Esther,9,6,"In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men."
Esther,9,7,"They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,"
Esther,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,11,The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.
Esther,9,12,"The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted.”"
Esther,9,13,"“If it pleases the king,” Esther answered, “give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled on poles.”"
Esther,9,14,"So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they impaled the ten sons of Haman."
Esther,9,15,"The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,16,"Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,17,"This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy."
Esther,9,18,"The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy."
Esther,9,19,"That is why rural Jews—those living in villages—observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other."
Esther,9,20,"Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far,"
Esther,9,21,to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar

Ecclesiastes,1,12,"I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,13,I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!
Ecclesiastes,1,14,"I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,1,15,What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.
Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,17,"Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,1,18,"For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief."
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"“Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?”"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives."
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
Ecclesiastes,2,5,I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
Ecclesiastes,2,6,I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.
Ecclesiastes,2,7,I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king’s successor do than what has already been done?"
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness."
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both."
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then I said to myself, “The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?” I said to myself, “This too is meaningless.”"
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die!"
Ecclesiastes,2,17,"So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
Ecclesiastes,2,20,So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,2,23,All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,"
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?"
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens:"
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,"
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,"
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,"
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,"
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,"
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,"
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace."
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What do workers gain from their toil?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
Ecclesiastes,3,12,I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment—wickedness was there, in the place of justice—wickedness was there."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said to myself, “God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time to judge every deed.”"
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals."
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed— and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors— and they have no comforter.
Ecclesiastes,4,2,"And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive."
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,"And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person’s envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,4,5,Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,7,Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. “For whom am I toiling,” he asked, “and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?” This too is meaningless— a miserable business!"
Ecclesiastes,4,9,"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor:"
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning.
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king’s successor."
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"A dream comes when there are many cares, and many words mark the speech of a fool."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?"
Ecclesiastes,5,7,Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,"
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when they have children there is nothing left for them to inherit."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"This too is a grievous evil: As everyone comes, so they depart, and what do they gain, since they toil for the wind?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,5,20,"They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart."
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man—"
Ecclesiastes,6,6,even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"Everyone’s toil is for their mouth, yet their appetite is never satisfied."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,What advantage have the wise over fools? What do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before others?
Ecclesiastes,6,9,"Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatever exists has already been named, and what humanity is has been known; no one can contend with someone who is stronger."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth."
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Frustration is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,"The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride."
Ecclesiastes,7,9,"Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is not wise to ask such questions."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,"Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun."
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: the righteous perishing in their righteousness, and the wicked living long in their wickedness."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,"Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise— why destroy yourself?"
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool— why die before your time?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18,It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins."
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you—"
Ecclesiastes,7,22,for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"All this I tested by wisdom and I said, “I am determined to be wise”— but this was beyond me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,Whatever exists is far off and most profound— who can discover it?
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"“Look,” says the Teacher, “this is what I have discovered: “Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"while I was still searching but not finding— I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have gone in search of many schemes.”"
Ecclesiastes,8,1,Who is like the wise? Who knows the explanation of things? A person’s wisdom brightens their face and changes its hard appearance.
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,"Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases."
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person may be weighed down by misery."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,"Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone else what is to come?"
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"As no one has power over the wind to contain it, so no one has power over the time of their death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him."
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night—
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good, so with the sinful; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,Anyone who is among the living has hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,"Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil."
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it."
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man."
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,"Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good."
Ecclesiastes,10,1,"As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor."

Ecclesiastes,10,11,"If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee."
Ecclesiastes,10,12,"Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but fools are consumed by their own lips."
Ecclesiastes,10,13,At the beginning their words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness—
Ecclesiastes,10,14,and fools multiply words. No one knows what is coming— who can tell someone else what will happen after them?
Ecclesiastes,10,15,The toil of fools wearies them; they do not know the way to town.
Ecclesiastes,10,16,Woe to the land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning.

Ecclesiastes,11,4,Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
Ecclesiastes,11,5,"As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things."
Ecclesiastes,11,6,"Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let your hands not be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well."
Ecclesiastes,11,7,"Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun."
Ecclesiastes,11,8,"However many years anyone may live, let them enjoy them all. But let them remember the days of darkness, for there will be many. Everything to come is meaningless."
Ecclesiastes,11,9,"You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment."
Ecclesiastes,11,10,"So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless."

Ecclesiastes,12,4,"when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when people rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;"
Ecclesiastes,12,5,when people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
Ecclesiastes,12,6,"Remember him—before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well,"
Ecclesiastes,12,7,"and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it."
Ecclesiastes,12,8,“Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Everything is meaningless!”
Ecclesiastes,12,9,"Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs."
Ecclesiastes,12,10,"The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true."
Ecclesiastes,12,11,"The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd."
Ecclesiastes,12,12,"Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body."
