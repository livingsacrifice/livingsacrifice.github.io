Matthew,17,18,"And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once."
Matthew,17,19,"Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not drive it out?”"
Matthew,17,20,"And He *said to them, “Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you."
Matthew,17,21,[But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.”]
Matthew,17,22,"And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men;"
Matthew,17,23,"and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day.” And they were deeply grieved."
Matthew,17,24,"When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?”"
Matthew,17,25,"He *said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from strangers?”"
Matthew,17,26,"When Peter said, “From strangers,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are exempt."
Matthew,17,27,"However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for you and Me.”"
Matthew,18,1,"At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”"
Matthew,18,2,"And He called a child to Himself and set him before them,"
Matthew,18,3,"and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,4,"Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,5,And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me;
Matthew,18,6,"but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."
Matthew,18,7,“Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!
Matthew,18,8,"“If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire."
Matthew,18,9,"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell."
Matthew,18,10,"“See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,18,11,[For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.]
Matthew,18,12,"“What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?"
Matthew,18,13,"If it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray."
Matthew,18,14,So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.
Matthew,18,15,"“If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother."
Matthew,18,16,"But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED."
Matthew,18,17,"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."
Matthew,18,18,"Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven."
Matthew,18,19,"“Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,18,20,"For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.”"
Matthew,18,21,"Then Peter came and said to Him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”"
Matthew,18,22,"Jesus *said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
Matthew,18,23,“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.
Matthew,18,24,"When he had begun to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him."
Matthew,18,25,"But since he did not have the means to repay, his lord commanded him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made."
Matthew,18,26,"So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.’"
Matthew,18,27,And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.
Matthew,18,28,"But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe.’"
Matthew,18,29,"So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him, saying, ‘Have patience with me and I will repay you.’"
Matthew,18,30,But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed.
Matthew,18,31,"So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened."
Matthew,18,32,"Then summoning him, his lord *said to him, ‘You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me."
Matthew,18,33,"Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?’"
Matthew,18,34,"And his lord, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him."
Matthew,18,35,"My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart.”"
Matthew,19,1,"When Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan;"
Matthew,19,2,"and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there."
Matthew,19,3,"Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?”"
Matthew,19,4,"And He answered and said, “Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE,"
Matthew,19,5,"and said, ‘FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH’?"
Matthew,19,6,"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”"
Matthew,19,7,"They *said to Him, “Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY?”"
Matthew,19,8,"He *said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way."
Matthew,19,9,"And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”"
Matthew,19,10,"The disciples *said to Him, “If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.”"
Matthew,19,11,"But He said to them, “Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given."
Matthew,19,12,"For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.”"
Matthew,19,13,Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew,19,14,"But Jesus said, “Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”"
Matthew,19,15,"After laying His hands on them, He departed from there."
Matthew,19,16,"And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?”"
Matthew,19,17,"And He said to him, “Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.”"
Matthew,19,18,"Then he *said to Him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS;"
Matthew,19,19,HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”
Matthew,19,20,"The young man *said to Him, “All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?”"
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”"
Matthew,19,22,"But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property."
Matthew,19,23,"And Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,19,24,"Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”"
Matthew,19,25,"When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished and said, “Then who can be saved?”"
Matthew,19,26,"And looking at them Jesus said to them, “With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”"
Matthew,19,27,"Then Peter said to Him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?”"
Matthew,19,28,"And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Matthew,19,29,"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name’s sake, will receive many times as much, and will inherit eternal life."
Matthew,19,30,"But many who are first will be last; and the last, first."
Matthew,20,1,“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
Matthew,20,2,"When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard."
Matthew,20,3,And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place;
Matthew,20,4,"and to those he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ And so they went."
Matthew,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing."
Matthew,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he *said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day long?’"
Matthew,20,7,"They *said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He *said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’"
Matthew,20,8,"“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.’"
Matthew,20,9,"When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius."
Matthew,20,10,"When those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius."
Matthew,20,11,"When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner,"
Matthew,20,12,"saying, ‘These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.’"
Matthew,20,13,"But he answered and said to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?"
Matthew,20,14,"Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you."
Matthew,20,15,Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?’
Matthew,20,16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last.”"
Matthew,20,17,"As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,"
Matthew,20,18,"“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,"
Matthew,20,19,"and will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised up.”"
Matthew,20,20,"Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him."
Matthew,20,21,"And He said to her, “What do you wish?” She *said to Him, “Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left.”"
Matthew,20,22,"But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They *said to Him, “We are able.”"
Matthew,20,23,"He *said to them, “My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.”"
Matthew,20,24,"And hearing this, the ten became indignant with the two brothers."
Matthew,20,25,"But Jesus called them to Himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them."
Matthew,20,26,"It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant,"
Matthew,20,27,and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave;
Matthew,20,28,"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”"
Matthew,20,29,"As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him."
Matthew,20,30,"And two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”"
Matthew,20,31,"The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”"
Matthew,20,32,"And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, “What do you want Me to do for you?”"
Matthew,20,33,"They *said to Him, “Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.”"
Matthew,20,34,"Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him."
Matthew,21,1,"When they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,"
Matthew,21,2,"saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me."
Matthew,21,3,"If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.”"
Matthew,21,4,This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
Matthew,21,5,"“SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, ‘BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.’”"
Matthew,21,6,"The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them,"
Matthew,21,7,"and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their coats on them; and He sat on the coats."
Matthew,21,8,"Most of the crowd spread their coats in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road."
Matthew,21,9,"The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!”"
Matthew,21,10,"When He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?”"
Matthew,21,11,"And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”"
Matthew,21,12,"And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves."
Matthew,21,13,"And He *said to them, “It is written, ‘MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER’; but you are making it a ROBBERS’ DEN.”"
Matthew,21,14,"And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them."
Matthew,21,15,"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were shouting in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became indignant"
Matthew,21,16,"and said to Him, “Do You hear what these children are saying?” And Jesus *said to them, “Yes; have you never read, ‘OUT OF THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABIES YOU HAVE PREPARED PRAISE FOR YOURSELF’?”"
Matthew,21,17,"And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there."
Matthew,21,18,"Now in the morning, when He was returning to the city, He became hungry."
Matthew,21,19,"Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only; and He *said to it, “No longer shall there ever be any fruit from you.” And at once the fig tree withered."
Matthew,21,20,"Seeing this, the disciples were amazed and asked, “How did the fig tree wither all at once?”"
Matthew,21,21,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen."
Matthew,21,22,"And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”"
Matthew,21,23,"When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, “By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”"
Matthew,21,24,"Jesus said to them, “I will also ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things."
Matthew,21,25,"The baptism of John was from what source, from heaven or from men?” And they began reasoning among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’"
Matthew,21,26,"But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people; for they all regard John as a prophet.”"
Matthew,21,27,"And answering Jesus, they said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
Matthew,21,28,"“But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in the vineyard.’"
Matthew,21,29,"And he answered, ‘I will not’; but afterward he regretted it and went."
Matthew,21,30,"The man came to the second and said the same thing; and he answered, ‘I will, sir’; but he did not go."
Matthew,21,31,"Which of the two did the will of his father?” They *said, “The first.” Jesus *said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you."
Matthew,21,32,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him."
Matthew,21,33,"“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey."
Matthew,21,34,"When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce."
Matthew,21,35,"The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third."
Matthew,21,36,Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them.
Matthew,21,37,"But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’"
Matthew,21,38,"But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’"
Matthew,21,39,"They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him."
Matthew,21,40,"Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?”"
Matthew,21,41,"They *said to Him, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons.”"
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus *said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES’?"
Matthew,21,43,"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people, producing the fruit of it."
Matthew,21,44,"And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.”"
Matthew,21,45,"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them."
Matthew,21,46,"When they sought to seize Him, they feared the people, because they considered Him to be a prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,"
Matthew,22,2,“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.
Matthew,22,3,"And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come."
Matthew,22,4,"Again he sent out other slaves saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.”’"
Matthew,22,5,"But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,"
Matthew,22,6,and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.
Matthew,22,7,"But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire."
Matthew,22,8,"Then he *said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy."
Matthew,22,9,"Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.’"
Matthew,22,10,"Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests."
Matthew,22,11,"“But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,"
Matthew,22,12,"and he *said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?’ And the man was speechless."
Matthew,22,13,"Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’"
Matthew,22,14,"For many are called, but few are chosen.”"
Matthew,22,15,Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.
Matthew,22,16,"And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any."
Matthew,22,17,"Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?”"
Matthew,22,18,"But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, “Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?"
Matthew,22,19,Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.” And they brought Him a denarius.
Matthew,22,20,"And He *said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?”"
Matthew,22,21,"They *said to Him, “Caesar’s.” Then He *said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.”"
Matthew,22,22,"And hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away."
Matthew,22,23,"On that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him,"
Matthew,22,24,"asking, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.’"
Matthew,22,25,"Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother;"
Matthew,22,26,"so also the second, and the third, down to the seventh."
Matthew,22,27,"Last of all, the woman died."
Matthew,22,28,"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.”"
Matthew,22,29,"But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God."
Matthew,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
Matthew,22,31,"But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:"
Matthew,22,32,"‘I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”"
Matthew,22,33,"When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching."
Matthew,22,34,"But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together."
Matthew,22,35,"One of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,"
Matthew,22,36,"“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?”"
Matthew,22,37,"And He said to him, “‘YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.’"
Matthew,22,38,This is the great and foremost commandment.
Matthew,22,39,"The second is like it, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.’"
Matthew,22,40,On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.”
Matthew,22,41,"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:"
Matthew,22,42,"“What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?” They *said to Him, “The son of David.”"
Matthew,22,43,"He *said to them, “Then how does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying,"
Matthew,22,44,"‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, “SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET”’?"
Matthew,22,45,"If David then calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his son?”"
Matthew,22,46,"No one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question."
Matthew,23,1,"Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,"
Matthew,23,2,saying: “The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;
Matthew,23,3,"therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them."
Matthew,23,4,"They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger."
Matthew,23,5,But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
Matthew,23,6,"They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues,"
Matthew,23,7,"and respectful greetings in the market places, and being called Rabbi by men."
Matthew,23,8,"But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Matthew,23,9,"Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven."
Matthew,23,10,"Do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ."
Matthew,23,11,But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew,23,12,Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
Matthew,23,13,"“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in."
Matthew,23,14,"[Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.]"
Matthew,23,15,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves."
Matthew,23,16,"“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.’"
Matthew,23,17,"You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?"
Matthew,23,18,"And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.’"
Matthew,23,19,"You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering?"
Matthew,23,20,"Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it."
Matthew,23,21,"And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it."
Matthew,23,22,"And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it."
Matthew,23,23,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others."
Matthew,23,24,"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!"
Matthew,23,25,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence."
Matthew,23,26,"You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also."
Matthew,23,27,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness."
Matthew,23,28,"So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."
Matthew,23,29,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,"
Matthew,23,30,"and say, ‘If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’"
Matthew,23,31,"So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets."
Matthew,23,32,"Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers."
Matthew,23,33,"You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?"
Matthew,23,34,"“Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city,"
Matthew,23,35,"so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
Matthew,23,36,"Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation."
Matthew,23,37,"“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling."
Matthew,23,38,"Behold, your house is being left to you desolate!"
Matthew,23,39,"For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, ‘BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!’”"
Matthew,24,1,Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him.
Matthew,24,2,"And He said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down.”"
Matthew,24,3,"As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?”"
Matthew,24,4,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “See to it that no one misleads you."
Matthew,24,5,"For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will mislead many."
Matthew,24,6,"You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end."
Matthew,24,7,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes."
Matthew,24,8,But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.
Matthew,24,9,"“Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name."
Matthew,24,10,At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another.
Matthew,24,11,Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.
Matthew,24,12,"Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold."
Matthew,24,13,"But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved."
Matthew,24,14,"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."
Matthew,24,15,"“Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),"
Matthew,24,16,then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.
Matthew,24,17,Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house.
Matthew,24,18,Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.
Matthew,24,19,But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
Matthew,24,20,"But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath."
Matthew,24,21,"For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will."
Matthew,24,22,"Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short."
Matthew,24,23,"Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘There He is,’ do not believe him."
Matthew,24,24,"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect."
Matthew,24,25,"Behold, I have told you in advance."
Matthew,24,26,"So if they say to you, ‘Behold, He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or, ‘Behold, He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe them."
Matthew,24,27,"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be."
Matthew,24,28,"Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather."
Matthew,24,29,"“But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
Matthew,24,30,"And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory."
Matthew,24,31,"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other."
Matthew,24,32,"“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;"
Matthew,24,33,"so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, right at the door."
Matthew,24,34,"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place."
Matthew,24,35,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
Matthew,24,36,"“But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone."
Matthew,24,37,For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.
Matthew,24,38,"For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,"
Matthew,24,39,and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew,24,40,Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew,24,41,Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew,24,42,"“Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming."
Matthew,24,43,"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
Matthew,24,44,For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.
Matthew,24,45,“Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?
Matthew,24,46,Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
Matthew,24,47,Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
Matthew,24,48,"But if that evil slave says in his heart, ‘My master is not coming for a long time,’"
Matthew,24,49,and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards;
Matthew,24,50,"the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know,"
Matthew,24,51,and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,25,1,"“Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Matthew,25,2,"Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent."
Matthew,25,3,"For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,"
Matthew,25,4,but the prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps.
Matthew,25,5,"Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep."
Matthew,25,6,"But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’"
Matthew,25,7,Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew,25,8,"The foolish said to the prudent, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’"
Matthew,25,9,"But the prudent answered, ‘No, there will not be enough for us and you too; go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’"
Matthew,25,10,"And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut."
Matthew,25,11,"Later the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open up for us.’"
Matthew,25,12,"But he answered, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you.’"
Matthew,25,13,"Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour."
Matthew,25,14,"“For it is just like a man about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them."
Matthew,25,15,"To one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey."
Matthew,25,16,"Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents."
Matthew,25,17,In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more.
Matthew,25,18,"But he who received the one talent went away, and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money."
Matthew,25,19,“Now after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them.
Matthew,25,20,"The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.’"
Matthew,25,21,"His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’"
Matthew,25,22,"“Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said, ‘Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents.’"
Matthew,25,23,"His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’"
Matthew,25,24,"“And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed."
Matthew,25,25,"And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’"
Matthew,25,26,"“But his master answered and said to him, ‘You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed."
Matthew,25,27,"Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest."
Matthew,25,28,"Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.’"
Matthew,25,29,"“For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away."
Matthew,25,30,Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,25,31,"“But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne."
Matthew,25,32,"All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;"
Matthew,25,33,"and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left."
Matthew,25,34,"“Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
Matthew,25,35,"For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in;"
Matthew,25,36,"naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’"
Matthew,25,37,"Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink?"
Matthew,25,38,"And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You?"
Matthew,25,39,"When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’"
Matthew,25,40,"The King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.’"
Matthew,25,41,"“Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;"
Matthew,25,42,"for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink;"
Matthew,25,43,"I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’"
Matthew,25,44,"Then they themselves also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?’"
Matthew,25,45,"Then He will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’"
Matthew,25,46,"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”"
Matthew,26,1,"When Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples,"
Matthew,26,2,"“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is to be handed over for crucifixion.”"
Matthew,26,3,"Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;"
Matthew,26,4,and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill Him.
Matthew,26,5,"But they were saying, “Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people.”"
Matthew,26,6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper,"
Matthew,26,7,"a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at the table."
Matthew,26,8,"But the disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, “Why this waste?"
Matthew,26,9,For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”
Matthew,26,10,"But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me."
Matthew,26,11,For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me.
Matthew,26,12,"For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial."
Matthew,26,13,"Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.”"
Matthew,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests"
Matthew,26,15,"and said, “What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?” And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him."
Matthew,26,16,From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.
Matthew,26,17,"Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”"
Matthew,26,18,"And He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near; I am to keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.”’”"
Matthew,26,19,The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
Matthew,26,20,"Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples."
Matthew,26,21,"As they were eating, He said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.”"
Matthew,26,22,"Being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, “Surely not I, Lord?”"
Matthew,26,23,"And He answered, “He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me."
Matthew,26,24,"The Son of Man is to go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”"
Matthew,26,25,"And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” Jesus *said to him, “You have said it yourself.”"
Matthew,26,26,"While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.”"
Matthew,26,27,"And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you;"
Matthew,26,28,"for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins."
Matthew,26,29,"But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.”"
Matthew,26,30,"After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
Matthew,26,31,"Then Jesus *said to them, “You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, ‘I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE SCATTERED.’"
Matthew,26,32,"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”"
Matthew,26,33,"But Peter said to Him, “Even though all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away.”"
Matthew,26,34,"Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”"
Matthew,26,35,"Peter *said to Him, “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You.” All the disciples said the same thing too."
Matthew,26,36,"Then Jesus *came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and *said to His disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”"
Matthew,26,37,"And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed."
Matthew,26,38,"Then He *said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me.”"
Matthew,26,39,"And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.”"
Matthew,26,40,"And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, “So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour?"
Matthew,26,41,"Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”"
Matthew,26,42,"He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.”"
Matthew,26,43,"Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy."
Matthew,26,44,"And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more."
Matthew,26,45,"Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Matthew,26,46,"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!”"
Matthew,26,47,"While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who came from the chief priests and elders of the people."
Matthew,26,48,"Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.”"
Matthew,26,49,"Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed Him."
Matthew,26,50,"And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you have come for.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him."
Matthew,26,51,"And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear."
Matthew,26,52,"Then Jesus *said to him, “Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword."
Matthew,26,53,"Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?"
Matthew,26,54,"How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?”"
Matthew,26,55,"At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me."
Matthew,26,56,But all this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures of the prophets.” Then all the disciples left Him and fled.
Matthew,26,57,"Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together."
Matthew,26,58,"But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome."
Matthew,26,59,"Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death."
Matthew,26,60,"They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward,"
Matthew,26,61,"and said, “This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’”"
Matthew,26,62,"The high priest stood up and said to Him, “Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?”"
Matthew,26,63,"But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, “I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.”"
Matthew,26,64,"Jesus *said to him, “You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.”"
Matthew,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy;"
Matthew,26,66,"what do you think?” They answered, “He deserves death!”"
Matthew,26,67,"Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him,"
Matthew,26,68,"and said, “Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?”"
Matthew,26,69,"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, “You too were with Jesus the Galilean.”"
Matthew,26,70,"But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.”"
Matthew,26,71,"When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and *said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”"
Matthew,26,72,"And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.”"
Matthew,26,73,"A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Surely you too are one of them; for even the way you talk gives you away.”"
Matthew,26,74,"Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed."
Matthew,26,75,"And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, “Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly."
Matthew,27,1,"Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death;"
Matthew,27,2,"and they bound Him, and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor."
Matthew,27,3,"Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
Matthew,27,4,"saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to that yourself!”"
Matthew,27,5,And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
Matthew,27,6,"The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood.”"
Matthew,27,7,And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter’s Field as a burial place for strangers.
Matthew,27,8,For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Matthew,27,9,"Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel;"
Matthew,27,10,"AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER’S FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME.”"
Matthew,27,11,"Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And Jesus said to him, “It is as you say.”"
Matthew,27,12,"And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer."
Matthew,27,13,"Then Pilate *said to Him, “Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?”"
Matthew,27,14,"And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge, so the governor was quite amazed."
Matthew,27,15,Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people any one prisoner whom they wanted.
Matthew,27,16,"At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas."
Matthew,27,17,"So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”"
Matthew,27,18,For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over.
Matthew,27,19,"While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.”"
Matthew,27,20,But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death.
Matthew,27,21,"But the governor said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”"
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate *said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all *said, “Crucify Him!”"
Matthew,27,23,"And he said, “Why, what evil has He done?” But they kept shouting all the more, saying, “Crucify Him!”"
Matthew,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this Man’s blood; see to that yourselves.”"
Matthew,27,25,"And all the people said, “His blood shall be on us and on our children!”"
Matthew,27,26,"Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified."
Matthew,27,27,Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him.
Matthew,27,28,They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.
Matthew,27,29,"And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”"
Matthew,27,30,"They spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head."
Matthew,27,31,"After they had mocked Him, they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him."
Matthew,27,32,"As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross."
Matthew,27,33,"And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,"
Matthew,27,34,"they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink."
Matthew,27,35,"And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots."
Matthew,27,36,"And sitting down, they began to keep watch over Him there."
Matthew,27,37,"And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read, “THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
Matthew,27,38,"At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left."
Matthew,27,39,"And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads"
Matthew,27,40,"and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”"
Matthew,27,41,"In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying,"
Matthew,27,42,"“He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him."
Matthew,27,43,"HE TRUSTS IN GOD; LET GOD RESCUE Him now, IF HE DELIGHTS IN HIM; for He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”"
Matthew,27,44,The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words.
Matthew,27,45,Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew,27,46,"About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?” that is, “MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?”"
Matthew,27,47,"And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, began saying, “This man is calling for Elijah.”"
Matthew,27,48,"Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink."
Matthew,27,49,"But the rest of them said, “Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him.”"
Matthew,27,50,"And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit."
Matthew,27,51,"And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split."
Matthew,27,52,"The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;"
Matthew,27,53,and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
Matthew,27,54,"Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”"
Matthew,27,55,"Many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him."
Matthew,27,56,"Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee."
Matthew,27,57,"When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus."
Matthew,27,58,This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
Matthew,27,59,"And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
Matthew,27,60,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away."
Matthew,27,61,"And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave."
Matthew,27,62,"Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,"
Matthew,27,63,"and said, “Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I am to rise again.’"
Matthew,27,64,"Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”"
Matthew,27,65,"Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how.”"
Matthew,27,66,"And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone."
Matthew,28,1,"Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave."
Matthew,28,2,"And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it."
Matthew,28,3,"And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow."
Matthew,28,4,The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men.
Matthew,28,5,"The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified."
Matthew,28,6,"He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying."
Matthew,28,7,"Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you.”"
Matthew,28,8,And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.
Matthew,28,9,"And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Jesus *said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.”"
Matthew,28,11,"Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened."
Matthew,28,12,"And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,"
Matthew,28,13,"and said, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’"
Matthew,28,14,"And if this should come to the governor’s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.”"
Matthew,28,15,"And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day."
Matthew,28,16,"But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated."
Matthew,28,17,"When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful."
Matthew,28,18,"And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth."
Matthew,28,19,"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,"
Matthew,28,20,"teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”"
Mark,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
Mark,1,2,"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY;"
Mark,1,3,"THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.’”"
Mark,1,4,John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
Mark,1,5,"And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins."
Mark,1,6,"John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey."
Mark,1,7,"And he was preaching, and saying, “After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals."
Mark,1,8,I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
Mark,1,9,In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mark,1,10,"Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him;"
Mark,1,11,"and a voice came out of the heavens: “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.”"
Mark,1,12,Immediately the Spirit *impelled Him to go out into the wilderness.
Mark,1,13,"And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him."
Mark,1,14,"Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,"
Mark,1,15,"and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”"
Mark,1,16,"As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen."
Mark,1,17,"And Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.”"
Mark,1,18,Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
Mark,1,19,"Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets."
Mark,1,20,"Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him."
Mark,1,21,They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
Mark,1,22,"They were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
Mark,1,23,"Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
Mark,1,24,"saying, “What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”"
Mark,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”"
Mark,1,26,"Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him."
Mark,1,27,"They were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”"
Mark,1,28,Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.
Mark,1,29,"And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
Mark,1,30,Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they *spoke to Jesus about her.
Mark,1,31,"And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them."
Mark,1,32,"When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed."
Mark,1,33,And the whole city had gathered at the door.
Mark,1,34,"And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was."
Mark,1,35,"In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there."
Mark,1,36,Simon and his companions searched for Him;
Mark,1,37,"they found Him, and *said to Him, “Everyone is looking for You.”"
Mark,1,38,"He *said to them, “Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also; for that is what I came for.”"
Mark,1,39,"And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons."
Mark,1,40,"And a leper *came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”"
Mark,1,41,"Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and *said to him, “I am willing; be cleansed.”"
Mark,1,42,Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
Mark,1,43,"And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,"
Mark,1,44,"and He *said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”"
Mark,1,45,"But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere."
Mark,2,1,"When He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home."
Mark,2,2,"And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them."
Mark,2,3,"And they *came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men."
Mark,2,4,"Being unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying."
Mark,2,5,"And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”"
Mark,2,6,"But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,"
Mark,2,7,“Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Mark,2,8,"Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, *said to them, “Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?"
Mark,2,9,"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven’; or to say, ‘Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk’?"
Mark,2,10,"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He *said to the paralytic,"
Mark,2,11,"“I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home.”"
Mark,2,12,"And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”"
Mark,2,13,"And He went out again by the seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them."
Mark,2,14,"As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax booth, and He *said to him, “Follow Me!” And he got up and followed Him."
Mark,2,15,"And it *happened that He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many of them, and they were following Him."
Mark,2,16,"When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, “Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Mark,2,17,"And hearing this, Jesus *said to them, “It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”"
Mark,2,18,"John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they *came and *said to Him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”"
Mark,2,19,"And Jesus said to them, “While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
Mark,2,20,"But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day."
Mark,2,21,"“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results."
Mark,2,22,"No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins as well; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.”"
Mark,2,23,"And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain."
Mark,2,24,"The Pharisees were saying to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”"
Mark,2,25,"And He *said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry;"
Mark,2,26,"how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?”"
Mark,2,27,"Jesus said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."
Mark,2,28,So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
Mark,3,1,He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was withered.
Mark,3,2,"They were watching Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him."
Mark,3,3,"He *said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and come forward!”"
Mark,3,4,"And He *said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent."
Mark,3,5,"After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored."
Mark,3,6,"The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians against Him, as to how they might destroy Him."
Mark,3,7,"Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and also from Judea,"
Mark,3,8,"and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard of all that He was doing and came to Him."
Mark,3,9,"And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crowd Him;"
Mark,3,10,"for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him."
Mark,3,11,"Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, “You are the Son of God!”"
Mark,3,12,And He earnestly warned them not to tell who He was.
Mark,3,13,"And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him."
Mark,3,14,"And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach,"
Mark,3,15,and to have authority to cast out the demons.
Mark,3,16,"And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),"
Mark,3,17,"and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, “Sons of Thunder”);"
Mark,3,18,"and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;"
Mark,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him."
Mark,3,20,"And He *came home, and the crowd *gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal."
Mark,3,21,"When His own people heard of this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He has lost His senses.”"
Mark,3,22,"The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.”"
Mark,3,23,"And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Mark,3,24,"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
Mark,3,25,"If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand."
Mark,3,26,"If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!"
Mark,3,27,"But no one can enter the strong man’s house and plunder his property unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house."
Mark,3,28,"“Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;"
Mark,3,29,"but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—"
Mark,3,30,"because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”"
Mark,3,31,"Then His mother and His brothers *arrived, and standing outside they sent word to Him and called Him."
Mark,3,32,"A crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.”"
Mark,3,33,"Answering them, He *said, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”"
Mark,3,34,"Looking about at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, “Behold My mother and My brothers!"
Mark,3,35,"For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.”"
Mark,4,1,He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
Mark,4,2,"And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching,"
Mark,4,3,"“Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow;"
Mark,4,4,"as he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up."
Mark,4,5,Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.
Mark,4,6,"And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
Mark,4,7,"Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop."
Mark,4,8,"Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”"
Mark,4,9,"And He was saying, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Mark,4,10,"As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables."
Mark,4,11,"And He was saying to them, “To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but those who are outside get everything in parables,"
Mark,4,12,"so that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN.”"
Mark,4,13,"And He *said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?"
Mark,4,14,The sower sows the word.
Mark,4,15,"These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them."
Mark,4,16,"In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;"
Mark,4,17,"and they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away."
Mark,4,18,"And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,"
Mark,4,19,"but the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
Mark,4,20,"And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”"
Mark,4,21,"And He was saying to them, “A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?"
Mark,4,22,"For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light."
Mark,4,23,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Mark,4,24,"And He was saying to them, “Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides."
Mark,4,25,"For whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.”"
Mark,4,26,"And He was saying, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;"
Mark,4,27,"and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows—how, he himself does not know."
Mark,4,28,"The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head."
Mark,4,29,"But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”"
Mark,4,30,"And He said, “How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?"
Mark,4,31,"It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil,"
Mark,4,32,"yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE.”"
Mark,4,33,"With many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to hear it;"
Mark,4,34,and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.
Mark,4,35,"On that day, when evening came, He *said to them, “Let us go over to the other side.”"
Mark,4,36,"Leaving the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him."
Mark,4,37,"And there *arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up."
Mark,4,38,"Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *woke Him and *said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”"
Mark,4,39,"And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Hush, be still.” And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm."
Mark,4,40,"And He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”"
Mark,4,41,"They became very much afraid and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”"
Mark,5,1,"They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes."
Mark,5,2,"When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him,"
Mark,5,3,"and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain;"
Mark,5,4,"because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him."
Mark,5,5,"Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones."
Mark,5,6,"Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him;"
Mark,5,7,"and shouting with a loud voice, he *said, “What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!”"
Mark,5,8,"For He had been saying to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”"
Mark,5,9,"And He was asking him, “What is your name?” And he *said to Him, “My name is Legion; for we are many.”"
Mark,5,10,And he began to implore Him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
Mark,5,11,Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain.
Mark,5,12,"The demons implored Him, saying, “Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.”"
Mark,5,13,"Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea."
Mark,5,14,Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And the people came to see what it was that had happened.
Mark,5,15,"They *came to Jesus and *observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the “legion”; and they became frightened."
Mark,5,16,"Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and all about the swine."
Mark,5,17,And they began to implore Him to leave their region.
Mark,5,18,"As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him."
Mark,5,19,"And He did not let him, but He *said to him, “Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you.”"
Mark,5,20,And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.
Mark,5,21,"When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore."
Mark,5,22,"One of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up, and on seeing Him, *fell at His feet"
Mark,5,23,"and *implored Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will get well and live.”"
Mark,5,24,And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.
Mark,5,25,"A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,"
Mark,5,26,"and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse—"
Mark,5,27,"after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak."
Mark,5,28,"For she thought, “If I just touch His garments, I will get well.”"
Mark,5,29,Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
Mark,5,30,"Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched My garments?”"
Mark,5,31,"And His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’”"
Mark,5,32,And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth."
Mark,5,34,"And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace and be healed of your affliction.”"
Mark,5,35,"While He was still speaking, they *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?”"
Mark,5,36,"But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, *said to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid any longer, only believe.”"
Mark,5,37,"And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James."
Mark,5,38,"They *came to the house of the synagogue official; and He *saw a commotion, and people loudly weeping and wailing."
Mark,5,39,"And entering in, He *said to them, “Why make a commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is asleep.”"
Mark,5,40,"They began laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He *took along the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and *entered the room where the child was."
Mark,5,41,"Taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, “Talitha kum!” (which translated means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”)."
Mark,5,42,"Immediately the girl got up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded."
Mark,5,43,"And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that something should be given her to eat."
Mark,6,1,Jesus went out from there and *came into His hometown; and His disciples *followed Him.
Mark,6,2,"When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?"
Mark,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him."
Mark,6,4,"Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.”"
Mark,6,5,And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.
Mark,6,6,And He wondered at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages teaching.
Mark,6,7,"And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits;"
Mark,6,8,"and He instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a mere staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belt—"
Mark,6,9,"but to wear sandals; and He added, “Do not put on two tunics.”"
Mark,6,10,"And He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town."
Mark,6,11,"Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them.”"
Mark,6,12,They went out and preached that men should repent.
Mark,6,13,And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them.
Mark,6,14,"And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become well known; and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him.”"
Mark,6,15,"But others were saying, “He is Elijah.” And others were saying, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”"
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen!”"
Mark,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her."
Mark,6,18,"For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”"
Mark,6,19,Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not do so;
Mark,6,20,"for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him."
Mark,6,21,A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee;
Mark,6,22,"and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.”"
Mark,6,23,"And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom.”"
Mark,6,24,"And she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”"
Mark,6,25,"Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”"
Mark,6,26,"And although the king was very sorry, yet because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he was unwilling to refuse her."
Mark,6,27,"Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went and had him beheaded in the prison,"
Mark,6,28,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,"When his disciples heard about this, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,The apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught.
Mark,6,31,"And He *said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a while.” (For there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.)"
Mark,6,32,They went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves.
Mark,6,33,"The people saw them going, and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them."
Mark,6,34,"When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things."
Mark,6,35,"When it was already quite late, His disciples came to Him and said, “This place is desolate and it is already quite late;"
Mark,6,36,send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
Mark,6,37,"But He answered them, “You give them something to eat!” And they *said to Him, “Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give them something to eat?”"
Mark,6,38,"And He *said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they found out, they *said, “Five, and two fish.”"
Mark,6,39,And He commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass.
Mark,6,40,They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties.
Mark,6,41,"And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food and broke the loaves and He kept giving them to the disciples to set before them; and He divided up the two fish among them all."
Mark,6,42,"They all ate and were satisfied,"
Mark,6,43,"and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish."
Mark,6,44,There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.
Mark,6,45,"Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while He Himself was sending the crowd away."
Mark,6,46,"After bidding them farewell, He left for the mountain to pray."
Mark,6,47,"When it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land."
Mark,6,48,"Seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them."
Mark,6,49,"But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;"
Mark,6,50,"for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, “Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid.”"
Mark,6,51,"Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly astonished,"
Mark,6,52,"for they had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened."
Mark,6,53,"When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"When they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,"
Mark,6,55,"and ran about that whole country and began to carry here and there on their pallets those who were sick, to the place they heard He was."
Mark,6,56,"Wherever He entered villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places, and imploring Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were being cured."
Mark,7,1,"The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem,"
Mark,7,2,"and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed."
Mark,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders;"
Mark,7,4,"and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)"
Mark,7,5,"The Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?”"
Mark,7,6,"And He said to them, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME."
Mark,7,7,"‘BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.’"
Mark,7,8,"Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”"
Mark,7,9,"He was also saying to them, “You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition."
Mark,7,10,"For Moses said, ‘HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER’; and, ‘HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH’;"
Mark,7,11,"but you say, ‘If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is to say, given to God),’"
Mark,7,12,you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother;
Mark,7,13,thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that.”
Mark,7,14,"After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, “Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:"
Mark,7,15,there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man.
Mark,7,16,"[If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”]"
Mark,7,17,"When he had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable."
Mark,7,18,"And He *said to them, “Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him,"
Mark,7,19,"because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?” (Thus He declared all foods clean.)"
Mark,7,20,"And He was saying, “That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,"
Mark,7,22,"deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness."
Mark,7,23,All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man.”
Mark,7,24,"Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know of it; yet He could not escape notice."
Mark,7,25,"But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet."
Mark,7,26,"Now the woman was a Gentile, of the Syrophoenician race. And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter."
Mark,7,27,"And He was saying to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”"
Mark,7,28,"But she answered and *said to Him, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children’s crumbs.”"
Mark,7,29,"And He said to her, “Because of this answer go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”"
Mark,7,30,"And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having left."
Mark,7,31,"Again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis."
Mark,7,32,"They *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they *implored Him to lay His hand on him."
Mark,7,33,"Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva;"
Mark,7,34,"and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He *said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”"
Mark,7,35,"And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly."
Mark,7,36,"And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it."
Mark,7,37,"They were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”"
Mark,8,1,"In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and *said to them,"
Mark,8,2,“I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat.
Mark,8,3,"If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance.”"
Mark,8,4,"And His disciples answered Him, “Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?”"
Mark,8,5,"And He was asking them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven.”"
Mark,8,6,"And He *directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the people."
Mark,8,7,"They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well."
Mark,8,8,And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces.
Mark,8,9,About four thousand were there; and He sent them away.
Mark,8,10,And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha.
Mark,8,11,"The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him."
Mark,8,12,"Sighing deeply in His spirit, He *said, “Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”"
Mark,8,13,"Leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side."
Mark,8,14,"And they had forgotten to take bread, and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them."
Mark,8,15,"And He was giving orders to them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”"
Mark,8,16,They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mark,8,17,"And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet see or understand? Do you have a hardened heart?"
Mark,8,18,"HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR? And do you not remember,"
Mark,8,19,"when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?” They *said to Him, “Twelve.”"
Mark,8,20,"“When I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” And they *said to Him, “Seven.”"
Mark,8,21,"And He was saying to them, “Do you not yet understand?”"
Mark,8,22,And they *came to Bethsaida. And they *brought a blind man to Jesus and *implored Him to touch him.
Mark,8,23,"Taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, “Do you see anything?”"
Mark,8,24,"And he looked up and said, “I see men, for I see them like trees, walking around.”"
Mark,8,25,"Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly."
Mark,8,26,"And He sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”"
Mark,8,27,"Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say that I am?”"
Mark,8,28,"They told Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.”"
Mark,8,29,"And He continued by questioning them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter *answered and *said to Him, “You are the Christ.”"
Mark,8,30,And He warned them to tell no one about Him.
Mark,8,31,"And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
Mark,8,32,And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
Mark,8,33,"But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and *said, “Get behind Me, Satan; for you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but man’s.”"
Mark,8,34,"And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me."
Mark,8,35,"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it."
Mark,8,36,"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?"
Mark,8,37,For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark,8,38,"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”"
Mark,9,1,"And Jesus was saying to them, “Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.”"
Mark,9,2,"Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them;"
Mark,9,3,"and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them."
Mark,9,4,Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,"Peter *said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Mark,9,6,For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified.
Mark,9,7,"Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!”"
Mark,9,8,"All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone."
Mark,9,9,"As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead."
Mark,9,10,"They seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant."
Mark,9,11,"They asked Him, saying, “Why is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”"
Mark,9,12,"And He said to them, “Elijah does first come and restore all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?"
Mark,9,13,"But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him.”"
Mark,9,14,"When they came back to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and some scribes arguing with them."
Mark,9,15,"Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and began running up to greet Him."
Mark,9,16,"And He asked them, “What are you discussing with them?”"
Mark,9,17,"And one of the crowd answered Him, “Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;"
Mark,9,18,"and whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not do it.”"
Mark,9,19,"And He *answered them and *said, “O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!”"
Mark,9,20,"They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth."
Mark,9,21,"And He asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood."
Mark,9,22,"It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!”"
Mark,9,23,"And Jesus said to him, “‘If You can?’ All things are possible to him who believes.”"
Mark,9,24,"Immediately the boy’s father cried out and said, “I do believe; help my unbelief.”"
Mark,9,25,"When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again.”"
Mark,9,26,"After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said, “He is dead!”"
Mark,9,27,But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up.
Mark,9,28,"When He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, “Why could we not drive it out?”"
Mark,9,29,"And He said to them, “This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer.”"
Mark,9,30,"From there they went out and began to go through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know about it."
Mark,9,31,"For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later.”"
Mark,9,32,"But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him."
Mark,9,33,"They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He began to question them, “What were you discussing on the way?”"
Mark,9,34,"But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest."
Mark,9,35,"Sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.”"
Mark,9,36,"Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them,"
Mark,9,37,"“Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me.”"
Mark,9,38,"John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.”"
Mark,9,39,"But Jesus said, “Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me."
Mark,9,40,For he who is not against us is for us.
Mark,9,41,"For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward."
Mark,9,42,"“Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea."
Mark,9,43,"If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,"
Mark,9,44,"[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]"
Mark,9,45,"If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell,"
Mark,9,46,"[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]"
Mark,9,47,"If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell,"
Mark,9,48,"where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED."
Mark,9,49,“For everyone will be salted with fire.
Mark,9,50,"Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”"
Mark,10,1,"Getting up, He *went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds *gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more began to teach them."
Mark,10,2,"Some Pharisees came up to Jesus, testing Him, and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife."
Mark,10,3,"And He answered and said to them, “What did Moses command you?”"
Mark,10,4,"They said, “Moses permitted a man TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY.”"
Mark,10,5,"But Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment."
Mark,10,6,"But from the beginning of creation, God MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE."
Mark,10,7,"FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER,"
Mark,10,8,"AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH; so they are no longer two, but one flesh."
Mark,10,9,"What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”"
Mark,10,10,In the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again.
Mark,10,11,"And He *said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;"
Mark,10,12,"and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.”"
Mark,10,13,And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.
Mark,10,14,"But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, “Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Mark,10,15,"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.”"
Mark,10,16,"And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them."
Mark,10,17,"As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and asked Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Mark,10,18,"And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone."
Mark,10,19,"You know the commandments, ‘DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, Do not defraud, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.’”"
Mark,10,20,"And he said to Him, “Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up.”"
Mark,10,21,"Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, “One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”"
Mark,10,22,"But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property."
Mark,10,23,"And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, “How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!”"
Mark,10,24,"The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus *answered again and *said to them, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!"
Mark,10,25,It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
Mark,10,26,"They were even more astonished and said to Him, “Then who can be saved?”"
Mark,10,27,"Looking at them, Jesus *said, “With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.”"
Mark,10,28,"Peter began to say to Him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed You.”"
Mark,10,29,"Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel’s sake,"
Mark,10,30,"but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life."
Mark,10,31,"But many who are first will be last, and the last, first.”"
Mark,10,32,"They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him,"
Mark,10,33,"saying, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles."
Mark,10,34,"They will mock Him and spit on Him, and scourge Him and kill Him, and three days later He will rise again.”"
Mark,10,35,"James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.”"
Mark,10,36,"And He said to them, “What do you want Me to do for you?”"
Mark,10,37,"They said to Him, “Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.”"
Mark,10,38,"But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”"
Mark,10,39,"They said to Him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized."
Mark,10,40,"But to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”"
Mark,10,41,"Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John."
Mark,10,42,"Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them."
Mark,10,43,"But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;"
Mark,10,44,and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.
Mark,10,45,"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”"
Mark,10,46,"Then they *came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road."
Mark,10,47,"When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Mark,10,48,"Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Mark,10,49,"And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him here.” So they *called the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage, stand up! He is calling for you.”"
Mark,10,50,"Throwing aside his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus."
Mark,10,51,"And answering him, Jesus said, “What do you want Me to do for you?” And the blind man said to Him, “Rabboni, I want to regain my sight!”"
Mark,10,52,"And Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has made you well.” Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road."
Mark,11,1,"As they *approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He *sent two of His disciples,"
Mark,11,2,"and *said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here."
Mark,11,3,"If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ you say, ‘The Lord has need of it’; and immediately he will send it back here.”"
Mark,11,4,"They went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they *untied it."
Mark,11,5,"Some of the bystanders were saying to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”"
Mark,11,6,"They spoke to them just as Jesus had told them, and they gave them permission."
Mark,11,7,They *brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it.
Mark,11,8,"And many spread their coats in the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields."
Mark,11,9,Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting: “Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD;
Mark,11,10,Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest!”
Mark,11,11,"Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple; and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late."
Mark,11,12,"On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry."
Mark,11,13,"Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."
Mark,11,14,"He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” And His disciples were listening."
Mark,11,15,"Then they *came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves;"
Mark,11,16,and He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
Mark,11,17,"And He began to teach and say to them, “Is it not written, ‘MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS’? But you have made it a ROBBERS’ DEN.”"
Mark,11,18,"The chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching."
Mark,11,19,"When evening came, they would go out of the city."
Mark,11,20,"As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up."
Mark,11,21,"Being reminded, Peter *said to Him, “Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.”"
Mark,11,22,"And Jesus *answered saying to them, “Have faith in God."
Mark,11,23,"Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him."
Mark,11,24,"Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you."
Mark,11,25,"Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions."
Mark,11,26,"[But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions.”]"
Mark,11,27,"They *came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders *came to Him,"
Mark,11,28,"and began saying to Him, “By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?”"
Mark,11,29,"And Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question, and you answer Me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark,11,30,"Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me.”"
Mark,11,31,"They began reasoning among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’"
Mark,11,32,"But shall we say, ‘From men’?”—they were afraid of the people, for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet."
Mark,11,33,"Answering Jesus, they *said, “We do not know.” And Jesus *said to them, “Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”"
Mark,12,1,"And He began to speak to them in parables: “A man PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT, AND DUG A VAT UNDER THE WINE PRESS AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey."
Mark,12,2,"At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order to receive some of the produce of the vineyard from the vine-growers."
Mark,12,3,"They took him, and beat him and sent him away empty-handed."
Mark,12,4,"Again he sent them another slave, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully."
Mark,12,5,"And he sent another, and that one they killed; and so with many others, beating some and killing others."
Mark,12,6,"He had one more to send, a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’"
Mark,12,7,"But those vine-growers said to one another, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!’"
Mark,12,8,"They took him, and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard."
Mark,12,9,"What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine-growers, and will give the vineyard to others."
Mark,12,10,"Have you not even read this Scripture: ‘THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone;"
Mark,12,11,"THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES’?”"
Mark,12,12,"And they were seeking to seize Him, and yet they feared the people, for they understood that He spoke the parable against them. And so they left Him and went away."
Mark,12,13,Then they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement.
Mark,12,14,"They *came and *said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"
Mark,12,15,"Shall we pay or shall we not pay?” But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at.”"
Mark,12,16,"They brought one. And He *said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” And they said to Him, “Caesar’s.”"
Mark,12,17,"And Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were amazed at Him."
Mark,12,18,"Some Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) *came to Jesus, and began questioning Him, saying,"
Mark,12,19,"“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN’S BROTHER DIES and leaves behind a wife AND LEAVES NO CHILD, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER."
Mark,12,20,"There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no children."
Mark,12,21,"The second one married her, and died leaving behind no children; and the third likewise;"
Mark,12,22,and so all seven left no children. Last of all the woman died also.
Mark,12,23,"In the resurrection, when they rise again, which one’s wife will she be? For all seven had married her.”"
Mark,12,24,"Jesus said to them, “Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God?"
Mark,12,25,"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
Mark,12,26,"But regarding the fact that the dead rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB’?"
Mark,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.”"
Mark,12,28,"One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, “What commandment is the foremost of all?”"
Mark,12,29,"Jesus answered, “The foremost is, ‘HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD;"
Mark,12,30,"AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH.’"
Mark,12,31,"The second is this, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”"
Mark,12,32,"The scribe said to Him, “Right, Teacher; You have truly stated that HE IS ONE, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE BESIDES HIM;"
Mark,12,33,"AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE ONE’S NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”"
Mark,12,34,"When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that, no one would venture to ask Him any more questions."
Mark,12,35,"And Jesus began to say, as He taught in the temple, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"David himself said in the Holy Spirit, ‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, “SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET.”’"
Mark,12,37,David himself calls Him ‘Lord’; so in what sense is He his son?” And the large crowd enjoyed listening to Him.
Mark,12,38,"In His teaching He was saying: “Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes, and like respectful greetings in the market places,"
Mark,12,39,"and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,"
Mark,12,40,"who devour widows’ houses, and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.”"
Mark,12,41,"And He sat down opposite the treasury, and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums."
Mark,12,42,"A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent."
Mark,12,43,"Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury;"
Mark,12,44,"for they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on.”"
Mark,13,1,"As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, “Teacher, behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!”"
Mark,13,2,"And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another which will not be torn down.”"
Mark,13,3,"As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately,"
Mark,13,4,"“Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?”"
Mark,13,5,"And Jesus began to say to them, “See to it that no one misleads you."
Mark,13,6,"Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He!’ and will mislead many."
Mark,13,7,"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end."
Mark,13,8,"For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pangs."
Mark,13,9,"“But be on your guard; for they will deliver you to the courts, and you will be flogged in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them."
Mark,13,10,The gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
Mark,13,11,"When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit."
Mark,13,12,"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death."
Mark,13,13,"You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved."
Mark,13,14,"“But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains."
Mark,13,15,"The one who is on the housetop must not go down, or go in to get anything out of his house;"
Mark,13,16,and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.
Mark,13,17,But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
Mark,13,18,But pray that it may not happen in the winter.
Mark,13,19,"For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will."
Mark,13,20,"Unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days."
Mark,13,21,"And then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ’; or, ‘Behold, He is there’; do not believe him;"
Mark,13,22,"for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect."
Mark,13,23,"But take heed; behold, I have told you everything in advance."
Mark,13,24,"“But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT,"
Mark,13,25,"AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken."
Mark,13,26,Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,"And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven."
Mark,13,28,"“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near."
Mark,13,29,"Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the door."
Mark,13,30,"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place."
Mark,13,31,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
Mark,13,32,"But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone."
Mark,13,33,"“Take heed, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come."
Mark,13,34,"It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert."
Mark,13,35,"Therefore, be on the alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning—"
Mark,13,36,in case he should come suddenly and find you asleep.
Mark,13,37,"What I say to you I say to all, ‘Be on the alert!’”"
Mark,14,1,Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth and kill Him;
Mark,14,2,"for they were saying, “Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot of the people.”"
Mark,14,3,"While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining at the table, there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume of pure nard; and she broke the vial and poured it over His head."
Mark,14,4,"But some were indignantly remarking to one another, “Why has this perfume been wasted?"
Mark,14,5,"For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.” And they were scolding her."
Mark,14,6,"But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you bother her? She has done a good deed to Me."
Mark,14,7,"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me."
Mark,14,8,She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.
Mark,14,9,"Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.”"
Mark,14,10,"Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them."
Mark,14,11,"They were glad when they heard this, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time."
Mark,14,12,"On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, “Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?”"
Mark,14,13,"And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, “Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;"
Mark,14,14,"and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’"
Mark,14,15,And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there.”
Mark,14,16,"The disciples went out and came to the city, and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover."
Mark,14,17,When it was evening He *came with the twelve.
Mark,14,18,"As they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me—one who is eating with Me.”"
Mark,14,19,"They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, “Surely not I?”"
Mark,14,20,"And He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl."
Mark,14,21,For the Son of Man is to go just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”
Mark,14,22,"While they were eating, He took some bread, and after a blessing He broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is My body.”"
Mark,14,23,"And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it."
Mark,14,24,"And He said to them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many."
Mark,14,25,"Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”"
Mark,14,26,"After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
Mark,14,27,"And Jesus *said to them, “You will all fall away, because it is written, ‘I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.’"
Mark,14,28,"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”"
Mark,14,29,"But Peter said to Him, “Even though all may fall away, yet I will not.”"
Mark,14,30,"And Jesus *said to him, “Truly I say to you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times.”"
Mark,14,31,"But Peter kept saying insistently, “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!” And they all were saying the same thing also."
Mark,14,32,"They *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, “Sit here until I have prayed.”"
Mark,14,33,"And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled."
Mark,14,34,"And He *said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch.”"
Mark,14,35,"And He went a little beyond them, and fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by."
Mark,14,36,"And He was saying, “Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.”"
Mark,14,37,"And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?"
Mark,14,38,"Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”"
Mark,14,39,"Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words."
Mark,14,40,"And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him."
Mark,14,41,"And He *came the third time, and *said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Mark,14,42,"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!”"
Mark,14,43,"Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
Mark,14,44,"Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard.”"
Mark,14,45,"After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him."
Mark,14,46,They laid hands on Him and seized Him.
Mark,14,47,"But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear."
Mark,14,48,"And Jesus said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a robber?"
Mark,14,49,"Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures.”"
Mark,14,50,And they all left Him and fled.
Mark,14,51,"A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they *seized him."
Mark,14,52,But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.
Mark,14,53,They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together.
Mark,14,54,"Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire."
Mark,14,55,"Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any."
Mark,14,56,"For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent."
Mark,14,57,"Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying,"
Mark,14,58,"“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”"
Mark,14,59,Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.
Mark,14,60,"The high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying, “Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?”"
Mark,14,61,"But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”"
Mark,14,62,"And Jesus said, “I am; and you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.”"
Mark,14,63,"Tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, “What further need do we have of witnesses?"
Mark,14,64,You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?” And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.
Mark,14,65,"Some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in the face."
Mark,14,66,"As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came,"
Mark,14,67,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, “You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.”"
Mark,14,68,"But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.” And he went out onto the porch."
Mark,14,69,"The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, “This is one of them!”"
Mark,14,70,"But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean too.”"
Mark,14,71,"But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man you are talking about!”"
Mark,14,72,"Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he began to weep."
Mark,15,1,"Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He *answered him, “It is as you say.”"
Mark,15,3,The chief priests began to accuse Him harshly.
Mark,15,4,"Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, “Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!”"
Mark,15,5,But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed.
Mark,15,6,Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.
Mark,15,7,The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark,15,8,The crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them.
Mark,15,9,"Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”"
Mark,15,10,For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.
Mark,15,11,But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead.
Mark,15,12,"Answering again, Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?”"
Mark,15,13,"They shouted back, “Crucify Him!”"
Mark,15,14,"But Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has He done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify Him!”"
Mark,15,15,"Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified."
Mark,15,16,"The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole Roman cohort."
Mark,15,17,"They *dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;"
Mark,15,18,"and they began to acclaim Him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”"
Mark,15,19,"They kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him."
Mark,15,20,"After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him."
Mark,15,21,"They *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross."
Mark,15,22,"Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull."
Mark,15,23,They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.
Mark,15,24,"And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take."
Mark,15,25,It was the third hour when they crucified Him.
Mark,15,26,"The inscription of the charge against Him read, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
Mark,15,27,"They *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left."
Mark,15,28,"[And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And He was numbered with transgressors.”]"
Mark,15,29,"Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,"
Mark,15,30,"save Yourself, and come down from the cross!”"
Mark,15,31,"In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking Him among themselves and saying, “He saved others; He cannot save Himself."
Mark,15,32,"Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him."
Mark,15,33,"When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour."
Mark,15,34,"At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?” which is translated, “MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?”"
Mark,15,35,"When some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, “Behold, He is calling for Elijah.”"
Mark,15,36,"Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, “Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down.”"
Mark,15,37,"And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last."
Mark,15,38,And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
Mark,15,39,"When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”"
Mark,15,40,"There were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome."
Mark,15,41,"When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem."
Mark,15,42,"When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,"
Mark,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
Mark,15,44,"Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead."
Mark,15,45,"And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph."
Mark,15,46,"Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb."
Mark,15,47,Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was laid.
Mark,16,1,"When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him."
Mark,16,2,"Very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen."
Mark,16,3,"They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”"
Mark,16,4,"Looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large."
Mark,16,5,"Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed."
Mark,16,6,"And he *said to them, “Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, here is the place where they laid Him."
Mark,16,7,"But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.’”"
Mark,16,8,"They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid."
Mark,16,9,"[Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons."
Mark,16,10,"She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping."
Mark,16,11,"When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it."
Mark,16,12,"After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country."
Mark,16,13,"They went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either."
Mark,16,14,"Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen."
Mark,16,15,"And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation."
Mark,16,16,He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.
Mark,16,17,"These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues;"
Mark,16,18,"they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”"
Mark,16,19,"So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God."
Mark,16,20,"And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them, and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.] [And they promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions. And after that, Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.]"
Luke,1,1,"Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us,"
Luke,1,2,"just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word,"
Luke,1,3,"it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus;"
Luke,1,4,so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
Luke,1,5,"In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth."
Luke,1,6,"They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord."
Luke,1,7,"But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years."
Luke,1,8,"Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed order of his division,"
Luke,1,9,"according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense."
Luke,1,10,And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering.
Luke,1,11,"And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense."
Luke,1,12,"Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear gripped him."
Luke,1,13,"But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John."
Luke,1,14,"You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth."
Luke,1,15,"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and he will drink no wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother’s womb."
Luke,1,16,And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.
Luke,1,17,"It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”"
Luke,1,18,"Zacharias said to the angel, “How will I know this for certain? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.”"
Luke,1,19,"The angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news."
Luke,1,20,"And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”"
Luke,1,21,"The people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple."
Luke,1,22,"But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute."
Luke,1,23,"When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home."
Luke,1,24,"After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,"
Luke,1,25,"“This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor upon me, to take away my disgrace among men.”"
Luke,1,26,"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,"
Luke,1,27,"to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary."
Luke,1,28,"And coming in, he said to her, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”"
Luke,1,29,"But she was very perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was."
Luke,1,30,"The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God."
Luke,1,31,"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus."
Luke,1,32,He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;
Luke,1,33,"and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”"
Luke,1,34,"Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”"
Luke,1,35,"The angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God."
Luke,1,36,"And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month."
Luke,1,37,For nothing will be impossible with God.”
Luke,1,38,"And Mary said, “Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her."
Luke,1,39,"Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah,"
Luke,1,40,and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
Luke,1,41,"When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."
Luke,1,42,"And she cried out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
Luke,1,43,"And how has it happened to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?"
Luke,1,44,"For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy."
Luke,1,45,And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord.”
Luke,1,46,"And Mary said: “My soul exalts the Lord,"
Luke,1,47,And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
Luke,1,48,"“For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed."
Luke,1,49,“For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name.
Luke,1,50,“AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM.
Luke,1,51,“He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart.
Luke,1,52,"“He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble."
Luke,1,53,“HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; And sent away the rich empty-handed.
Luke,1,54,"“He has given help to Israel His servant, In remembrance of His mercy,"
Luke,1,55,"As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever.”"
Luke,1,56,"And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her home."
Luke,1,57,"Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son."
Luke,1,58,Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed His great mercy toward her; and they were rejoicing with her.
Luke,1,59,"And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zacharias, after his father."
Luke,1,60,"But his mother answered and said, “No indeed; but he shall be called John.”"
Luke,1,61,"And they said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.”"
Luke,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called."
Luke,1,63,"And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, “His name is John.” And they were all astonished."
Luke,1,64,"And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak in praise of God."
Luke,1,65,Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea.
Luke,1,66,"All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, “What then will this child turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him."
Luke,1,67,"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:"
Luke,1,68,"“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,"
Luke,1,69,And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of David His servant—
Luke,1,70,As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old—
Luke,1,71,"Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES, And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US;"
Luke,1,72,"To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant,"
Luke,1,73,"The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,"
Luke,1,74,"To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear,"
Luke,1,75,In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
Luke,1,76,"“And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS;"
Luke,1,77,"To give to His people the knowledge of salvation By the forgiveness of their sins,"
Luke,1,78,"Because of the tender mercy of our God, With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us,"
Luke,1,79,"TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, To guide our feet into the way of peace.”"
Luke,1,80,"And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel."
Luke,2,1,"Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth."
Luke,2,2,This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke,2,3,"And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city."
Luke,2,4,"Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,"
Luke,2,5,"in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child."
Luke,2,6,"While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth."
Luke,2,7,"And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."
Luke,2,8,In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
Luke,2,9,"And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened."
Luke,2,10,"But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;"
Luke,2,11,"for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."
Luke,2,12,This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
Luke,2,13,"And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,"
Luke,2,14,"“Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”"
Luke,2,15,"When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”"
Luke,2,16,"So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger."
Luke,2,17,"When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child."
Luke,2,18,And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
Luke,2,19,"But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart."
Luke,2,20,"The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them."
Luke,2,21,"And when eight days had passed, before His circumcision, His name was then called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb."
Luke,2,22,"And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord"
Luke,2,23,"(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “EVERY firstborn MALE THAT OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD”),"
Luke,2,24,"and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, “A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS.”"
Luke,2,25,"And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him."
Luke,2,26,And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke,2,27,"And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law,"
Luke,2,28,"then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
Luke,2,29,"“Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace, According to Your word;"
Luke,2,30,"For my eyes have seen Your salvation,"
Luke,2,31,"Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,"
Luke,2,32,"A LIGHT OF REVELATION TO THE GENTILES, And the glory of Your people Israel.”"
Luke,2,33,And His father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him.
Luke,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed—"
Luke,2,35,and a sword will pierce even your own soul—to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”
Luke,2,36,"And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,"
Luke,2,37,"and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers."
Luke,2,38,"At that very moment she came up and began giving thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem."
Luke,2,39,"When they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth."
Luke,2,40,"The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him."
Luke,2,41,Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
Luke,2,42,"And when He became twelve, they went up there according to the custom of the Feast;"
Luke,2,43,"and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents were unaware of it,"
Luke,2,44,"but supposed Him to be in the caravan, and went a day’s journey; and they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances."
Luke,2,45,"When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for Him."
Luke,2,46,"Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.
Luke,2,48,"When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You.”"
Luke,2,49,"And He said to them, “Why is it that you were looking for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father’s house?”"
Luke,2,50,But they did not understand the statement which He had made to them.
Luke,2,51,"And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all these things in her heart."
Luke,2,52,"And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."
Luke,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,"
Luke,3,2,"in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness."
Luke,3,3,"And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;"
Luke,3,4,"as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT."
Luke,3,5,"‘EVERY RAVINE WILL BE FILLED, AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL WILL BE BROUGHT LOW; THE CROOKED WILL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH;"
Luke,3,6,AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.’”
Luke,3,7,"So he began saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Luke,3,8,"Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham."
Luke,3,9,Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
Luke,3,10,"And the crowds were questioning him, saying, “Then what shall we do?”"
Luke,3,11,"And he would answer and say to them, “The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise.”"
Luke,3,12,"And some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?”"
Luke,3,13,"And he said to them, “Collect no more than what you have been ordered to.”"
Luke,3,14,"Some soldiers were questioning him, saying, “And what about us, what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages.”"
Luke,3,15,"Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ,"
Luke,3,16,"John answered and said to them all, “As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
Luke,3,17,"His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”"
Luke,3,18,So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people.
Luke,3,19,"But when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done,"
Luke,3,20,Herod also added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
Luke,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened,"
Luke,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.”"
Luke,3,23,"When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,"
Luke,3,24,"the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,"
Luke,3,25,"the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Naggai,"
Luke,3,26,"the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,"
Luke,3,27,"the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,"
Luke,3,28,"the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,"
Luke,3,29,"the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,"
Luke,3,30,"the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,"
Luke,3,31,"the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,"
Luke,3,32,"the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,"
Luke,3,33,"the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,"
Luke,3,34,"the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,"
Luke,3,35,"the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah,"
Luke,3,36,"the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,"
Luke,3,37,"the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,"
Luke,3,38,"the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."
Luke,4,1,"Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness"
Luke,4,2,"for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He became hungry."
Luke,4,3,"And the devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”"
Luke,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.’”"
Luke,4,5,And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke,4,6,"And the devil said to Him, “I will give You all this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish."
Luke,4,7,"Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours.”"
Luke,4,8,"Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.’”"
Luke,4,9,"And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;"
Luke,4,10,"for it is written, ‘HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,’"
Luke,4,11,"and, ‘ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.’”"
Luke,4,12,"And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is said, ‘YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.’”"
Luke,4,13,"When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time."
Luke,4,14,"And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district."
Luke,4,15,And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all.
Luke,4,16,"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read."
Luke,4,17,"And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the book and found the place where it was written,"
Luke,4,18,"“THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED,"
Luke,4,19,TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.”
Luke,4,20,"And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him."
Luke,4,21,"And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”"
Luke,4,22,"And all were speaking well of Him, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips; and they were saying, “Is this not Joseph’s son?”"
Luke,4,23,"And He said to them, “No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.’”"
Luke,4,24,"And He said, “Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown."
Luke,4,25,"But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;"
Luke,4,26,"and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow."
Luke,4,27,"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”"
Luke,4,28,And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;
Luke,4,29,"and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff."
Luke,4,30,"But passing through their midst, He went His way."
Luke,4,31,"And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath;"
Luke,4,32,"and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority."
Luke,4,33,"In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,"
Luke,4,34,"“Let us alone! What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”"
Luke,4,35,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet and come out of him!” And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people, he came out of him without doing him any harm."
Luke,4,36,"And amazement came upon them all, and they began talking with one another saying, “What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out.”"
Luke,4,37,And the report about Him was spreading into every locality in the surrounding district.
Luke,4,38,"Then He got up and left the synagogue, and entered Simon’s home. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her."
Luke,4,39,"And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she immediately got up and waited on them."
Luke,4,40,"While the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them."
Luke,4,41,"Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ."
Luke,4,42,"When day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them."
Luke,4,43,"But He said to them, “I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.”"
Luke,4,44,So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
Luke,5,1,"Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;"
Luke,5,2,and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.
Luke,5,3,"And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat."
Luke,5,4,"When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”"
Luke,5,5,"Simon answered and said, “Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down the nets.”"
Luke,5,6,"When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish, and their nets began to break;"
Luke,5,7,"so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink."
Luke,5,8,"But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus’ feet, saying, “Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!”"
Luke,5,9,For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken;
Luke,5,10,"and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men.”"
Luke,5,11,"When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him."
Luke,5,12,"While He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man covered with leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”"
Luke,5,13,"And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” And immediately the leprosy left him."
Luke,5,14,"And He ordered him to tell no one, “But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”"
Luke,5,15,"But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses."
Luke,5,16,But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray.
Luke,5,17,"One day He was teaching; and there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing."
Luke,5,18,And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him.
Luke,5,19,"But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, into the middle of the crowd, in front of Jesus."
Luke,5,20,"Seeing their faith, He said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you.”"
Luke,5,21,"The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”"
Luke,5,22,"But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts?"
Luke,5,23,"Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?"
Luke,5,24,"But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—He said to the paralytic—“I say to you, get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home.”"
Luke,5,25,"Immediately he got up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God."
Luke,5,26,"They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen remarkable things today.”"
Luke,5,27,"After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth, and He said to him, “Follow Me.”"
Luke,5,28,"And he left everything behind, and got up and began to follow Him."
Luke,5,29,And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them.
Luke,5,30,"The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”"
Luke,5,31,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick."
Luke,5,32,I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.”
Luke,5,33,"And they said to Him, “The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same, but Yours eat and drink.”"
Luke,5,34,"And Jesus said to them, “You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?"
Luke,5,35,"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.”"
Luke,5,36,"And He was also telling them a parable: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old."
Luke,5,37,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined."
Luke,5,38,But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
Luke,5,39,"And no one, after drinking old wine wishes for new; for he says, ‘The old is good enough.’”"
Luke,6,1,"Now it happened that He was passing through some grainfields on a Sabbath; and His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the grain."
Luke,6,2,"But some of the Pharisees said, “Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”"
Luke,6,3,"And Jesus answering them said, “Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,"
Luke,6,4,"how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?”"
Luke,6,5,"And He was saying to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”"
Luke,6,6,On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
Luke,6,7,"The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him."
Luke,6,8,"But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and come forward!” And he got up and came forward."
Luke,6,9,"And Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?”"
Luke,6,10,"After looking around at them all, He said to him, “Stretch out your hand!” And he did so; and his hand was restored."
Luke,6,11,"But they themselves were filled with rage, and discussed together what they might do to Jesus."
Luke,6,12,"It was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God."
Luke,6,13,"And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles:"
Luke,6,14,"Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;"
Luke,6,15,"and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot;"
Luke,6,16,"Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor."
Luke,6,17,"Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a large crowd of His disciples, and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,"
Luke,6,18,who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.
Luke,6,19,"And all the people were trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing them all."
Luke,6,20,"And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God."
Luke,6,21,"Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh."
Luke,6,22,"Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man."
Luke,6,23,"Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets."
Luke,6,24,"But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full."
Luke,6,25,"Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep."
Luke,6,26,"Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way."
Luke,6,27,"“But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,"
Luke,6,28,"bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you."
Luke,6,29,"Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either."
Luke,6,30,"Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back."
Luke,6,31,Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.
Luke,6,32,"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them."
Luke,6,33,"If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same."
Luke,6,34,"If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount."
Luke,6,35,"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men."
Luke,6,36,"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."
Luke,6,37,"“Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned."
Luke,6,38,"Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.”"
Luke,6,39,"And He also spoke a parable to them: “A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?"
Luke,6,40,"A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained, will be like his teacher."
Luke,6,41,"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?"
Luke,6,42,"Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye."
Luke,6,43,"For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit."
Luke,6,44,"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush."
Luke,6,45,The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.
Luke,6,46,"“Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?"
Luke,6,47,"Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:"
Luke,6,48,"he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built."
Luke,6,49,"But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly, is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”"
Luke,7,1,"When He had completed all His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,"And a centurion’s slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die."
Luke,7,3,"When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave."
Luke,7,4,"When they came to Jesus, they earnestly implored Him, saying, “He is worthy for You to grant this to him;"
Luke,7,5,for he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue.”
Luke,7,6,"Now Jesus started on His way with them; and when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof;"
Luke,7,7,"for this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Luke,7,8,"For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”"
Luke,7,9,"Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, “I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”"
Luke,7,10,"When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health."
Luke,7,11,"Soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large crowd."
Luke,7,12,"Now as He approached the gate of the city, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her."
Luke,7,13,"When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her, and said to her, “Do not weep.”"
Luke,7,14,"And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, “Young man, I say to you, arise!”"
Luke,7,15,The dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother.
Luke,7,16,"Fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited His people!”"
Luke,7,17,This report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district.
Luke,7,18,The disciples of John reported to him about all these things.
Luke,7,19,"Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?”"
Luke,7,20,"When the men came to Him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to You, to ask, ‘Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?’”"
Luke,7,21,At that very time He cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many who were blind.
Luke,7,22,"And He answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM."
Luke,7,23,Blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.”
Luke,7,24,"When the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Luke,7,25,But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces!
Luke,7,26,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"This is the one about whom it is written, ‘BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.’"
Luke,7,28,"I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”"
Luke,7,29,"When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged God’s justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John."
Luke,7,30,"But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God’s purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John."
Luke,7,31,"“To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?"
Luke,7,32,"They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another, and they say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’"
Luke,7,33,"For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’"
Luke,7,34,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’"
Luke,7,35,Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”
Luke,7,36,"Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table."
Luke,7,37,"And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume,"
Luke,7,38,"and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume."
Luke,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner.”"
Luke,7,40,"And Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he replied, “Say it, Teacher.”"
Luke,7,41,"“A moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty."
Luke,7,42,"When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. So which of them will love him more?”"
Luke,7,43,"Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more.” And He said to him, “You have judged correctly.”"
Luke,7,44,"Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair."
Luke,7,45,"You gave Me no kiss; but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet."
Luke,7,46,"You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume."
Luke,7,47,"For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.”"
Luke,7,48,"Then He said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.”"
Luke,7,49,"Those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”"
Luke,7,50,"And He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”"
Luke,8,1,"Soon afterwards, He began going around from one city and village to another, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God. The twelve were with Him,"
Luke,8,2,"and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,"
Luke,8,3,"and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means."
Luke,8,4,"When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:"
Luke,8,5,"“The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up."
Luke,8,6,"Other seed fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture."
Luke,8,7,Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.
Luke,8,8,"Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great.” As He said these things, He would call out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Luke,8,9,His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant.
Luke,8,10,"And He said, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND."
Luke,8,11,“Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.
Luke,8,12,"Those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away."
Luke,8,14,"The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity."
Luke,8,15,"But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance."
Luke,8,16,"“Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light."
Luke,8,17,"For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light."
Luke,8,18,"So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.”"
Luke,8,19,"And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd."
Luke,8,20,"And it was reported to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You.”"
Luke,8,21,"But He answered and said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”"
Luke,8,22,"Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out."
Luke,8,23,"But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they began to be swamped and to be in danger."
Luke,8,24,"They came to Jesus and woke Him up, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm."
Luke,8,25,"And He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?”"
Luke,8,26,"Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee."
Luke,8,27,"And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, “What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me.”"
Luke,8,29,"For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert."
Luke,8,30,"And Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion”; for many demons had entered him."
Luke,8,31,They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.
Luke,8,32,Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and the demons implored Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission.
Luke,8,33,And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
Luke,8,34,"When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country."
Luke,8,35,"The people went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened."
Luke,8,36,Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well.
Luke,8,37,"And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned."
Luke,8,38,"But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying,"
Luke,8,39,"“Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him."
Luke,8,40,"And as Jesus returned, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him."
Luke,8,41,"And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus’ feet, and began to implore Him to come to his house;"
Luke,8,42,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him."
Luke,8,43,"And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,"
Luke,8,44,"came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped."
Luke,8,45,"And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched Me?” And while they were all denying it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing in on You.”"
Luke,8,46,"But Jesus said, “Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had gone out of Me.”"
Luke,8,47,"When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed."
Luke,8,48,"And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.”"
Luke,8,49,"While He was still speaking, someone *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.”"
Luke,8,50,"But when Jesus heard this, He answered him, “Do not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be made well.”"
Luke,8,51,"When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother."
Luke,8,52,"Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, “Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep.”"
Luke,8,53,"And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she had died."
Luke,8,54,"He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, “Child, arise!”"
Luke,8,55,"And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave orders for something to be given her to eat."
Luke,8,56,Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
Luke,9,1,"And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases."
Luke,9,2,And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing.
Luke,9,3,"And He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece."
Luke,9,4,"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city."
Luke,9,5,"And as for those who do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”"
Luke,9,6,"Departing, they began going throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere."
Luke,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,"
Luke,9,8,"and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again."
Luke,9,9,"Herod said, “I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Him."
Luke,9,10,"When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida."
Luke,9,11,"But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing."
Luke,9,12,"Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, “Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place.”"
Luke,9,13,"But He said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.”"
Luke,9,14,"(For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, “Have them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each.”"
Luke,9,15,"They did so, and had them all sit down."
Luke,9,16,"Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke them, and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the people."
Luke,9,17,"And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets full."
Luke,9,18,"And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, “Who do the people say that I am?”"
Luke,9,19,"They answered and said, “John the Baptist, and others say Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again.”"
Luke,9,20,"And He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”"
Luke,9,21,"But He warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone,"
Luke,9,22,"saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day.”"
Luke,9,23,"And He was saying to them all, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me."
Luke,9,24,"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it."
Luke,9,25,"For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?"
Luke,9,26,"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,9,28,"Some eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray."
Luke,9,29,"And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming."
Luke,9,30,"And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,"
Luke,9,31,"who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem."
Luke,9,32,"Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him."
Luke,9,33,"And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not realizing what he was saying."
Luke,9,34,"While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!”"
Luke,9,36,"And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him."
Luke,9,38,"And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only boy,"
Luke,9,39,"and a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth; and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves."
Luke,9,40,"I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.”"
Luke,9,41,"And Jesus answered and said, “You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”"
Luke,9,42,"While he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father."
Luke,9,43,"And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples,"
Luke,9,44,“Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”
Luke,9,45,"But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement."
Luke,9,46,An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.
Luke,9,47,"But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side,"
Luke,9,48,"and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great.”"
Luke,9,49,"John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us.”"
Luke,9,50,"But Jesus said to him, “Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you.”"
Luke,9,51,"When the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined to go to Jerusalem;"
Luke,9,52,"and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him."
Luke,9,53,"But they did not receive Him, because He was traveling toward Jerusalem."
Luke,9,54,"When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”"
Luke,9,55,"But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, “You do not know what kind of spirit you are of;"
Luke,9,56,"for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”] And they went on to another village."
Luke,9,57,"As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”"
Luke,9,58,"And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”"
Luke,9,59,"And He said to another, “Follow Me.” But he said, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”"
Luke,9,60,"But He said to him, “Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,9,61,"Another also said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home.”"
Luke,9,62,"But Jesus said to him, “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,10,1,"Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come."
Luke,10,2,"And He was saying to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest."
Luke,10,3,"Go; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves."
Luke,10,4,"Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; and greet no one on the way."
Luke,10,5,"Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’"
Luke,10,6,"If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you."
Luke,10,7,"Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"Whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you;"
Luke,10,9,"and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’"
Luke,10,10,"But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,"
Luke,10,11,"‘Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.’"
Luke,10,12,"I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city."
Luke,10,13,"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
Luke,10,14,But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
Luke,10,15,"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades!"
Luke,10,16,"“The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”"
Luke,10,17,"The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.”"
Luke,10,18,"And He said to them, “I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning."
Luke,10,19,"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you."
Luke,10,20,"Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.”"
Luke,10,21,"At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight."
Luke,10,22,"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.”"
Luke,10,23,"Turning to the disciples, He said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see,"
Luke,10,24,"for I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them.”"
Luke,10,25,"And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Luke,10,26,"And He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?”"
Luke,10,27,"And he answered, “YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”"
Luke,10,28,"And He said to him, “You have answered correctly; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE.”"
Luke,10,29,"But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”"
Luke,10,30,"Jesus replied and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead."
Luke,10,31,"And by chance a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,32,"Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,33,"But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion,"
Luke,10,34,"and came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return I will repay you.’"
Luke,10,36,Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?”
Luke,10,37,"And he said, “The one who showed mercy toward him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”"
Luke,10,38,"Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home."
Luke,10,39,"She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord’s feet, listening to His word."
Luke,10,40,"But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me.”"
Luke,10,41,"But the Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things;"
Luke,10,42,"but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.”"
Luke,11,1,"It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples.”"
Luke,11,2,"And He said to them, “When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come."
Luke,11,3,‘Give us each day our daily bread.
Luke,11,4,"‘And forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.’”"
Luke,11,5,"Then He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves;"
Luke,11,6,"for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’;"
Luke,11,7,"and from inside he answers and says, ‘Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’"
Luke,11,8,"I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs."
Luke,11,9,"“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
Luke,11,10,"For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened."
Luke,11,11,"Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?"
Luke,11,12,"Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?"
Luke,11,13,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?”"
Luke,11,14,"And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed."
Luke,11,15,"But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”"
Luke,11,16,"Others, to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven."
Luke,11,17,"But He knew their thoughts and said to them, “Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls."
Luke,11,18,"If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul."
Luke,11,19,"And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? So they will be your judges."
Luke,11,20,"But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Luke,11,21,"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed."
Luke,11,22,"But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder."
Luke,11,23,"He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters."
Luke,11,24,"“When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’"
Luke,11,25,"And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order."
Luke,11,26,"Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”"
Luke,11,27,"While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.”"
Luke,11,28,"But He said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it.”"
Luke,11,29,"As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, “This generation is a wicked generation; it seeks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah."
Luke,11,30,"For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation."
Luke,11,31,"The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
Luke,11,32,"The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
Luke,11,33,"“No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light."
Luke,11,34,"The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness."
Luke,11,35,Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it, it will be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays.”"
Luke,11,37,"Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in, and reclined at the table."
Luke,11,38,"When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal."
Luke,11,39,"But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness."
Luke,11,40,"You foolish ones, did not He who made the outside make the inside also?"
Luke,11,41,"But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you."
Luke,11,42,"“But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb, and yet disregard justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others."
Luke,11,43,Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the market places.
Luke,11,44,"Woe to you! For you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it.”"
Luke,11,45,"One of the lawyers *said to Him in reply, “Teacher, when You say this, You insult us too.”"
Luke,11,46,"But He said, “Woe to you lawyers as well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers."
Luke,11,47,"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and it was your fathers who killed them."
Luke,11,48,"So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them, and you build their tombs."
Luke,11,49,"For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute,"
Luke,11,50,"so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,"
Luke,11,51,"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.’"
Luke,11,52,"Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering.”"
Luke,11,53,"When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects,"
Luke,11,54,plotting against Him to catch Him in something He might say.
Luke,12,1,"Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began saying to His disciples first of all, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known."
Luke,12,3,"Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops."
Luke,12,4,"“I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do."
Luke,12,5,"But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!"
Luke,12,6,Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.
Luke,12,7,"Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows."
Luke,12,8,"“And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God;"
Luke,12,9,but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
Luke,12,10,"And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him."
Luke,12,11,"When they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense, or what you are to say;"
Luke,12,12,for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.”
Luke,12,13,"Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.”"
Luke,12,14,"But He said to him, “Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?”"
Luke,12,15,"Then He said to them, “Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.”"
Luke,12,16,"And He told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man was very productive."
Luke,12,17,"And he began reasoning to himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?’"
Luke,12,18,"Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.”’"
Luke,12,20,"But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?’"
Luke,12,21,"So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”"
Luke,12,22,"And He said to His disciples, “For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on."
Luke,12,23,"For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing."
Luke,12,24,"Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!"
Luke,12,25,And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life’s span?
Luke,12,26,"If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters?"
Luke,12,27,"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these."
Luke,12,28,"But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You men of little faith!"
Luke,12,29,"And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying."
Luke,12,30,For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things.
Luke,12,31,"But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you."
Luke,12,32,"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"“Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys."
Luke,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
Luke,12,35,"“Be dressed in readiness, and keep your lamps lit."
Luke,12,36,"Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks."
Luke,12,37,"Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will gird himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and will come up and wait on them."
Luke,12,38,"Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves."
Luke,12,39,"“But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
Luke,12,40,"You too, be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect.”"
Luke,12,41,"Peter said, “Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?”"
Luke,12,42,"And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and sensible steward, whom his master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time?"
Luke,12,43,Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
Luke,12,44,Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
Luke,12,45,"But if that slave says in his heart, ‘My master will be a long time in coming,’ and begins to beat the slaves, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk;"
Luke,12,46,"the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers."
Luke,12,47,"And that slave who knew his master’s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, will receive many lashes,"
Luke,12,48,"but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more."
Luke,12,49,“I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled!
Luke,12,50,"But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!"
Luke,12,51,"Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division;"
Luke,12,52,"for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three."
Luke,12,53,"They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”"
Luke,12,54,"And He was also saying to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it turns out."
Luke,12,55,"And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It will be a hot day,’ and it turns out that way."
Luke,12,56,"You hypocrites! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not analyze this present time?"
Luke,12,57,“And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right?
Luke,12,58,"For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate, on your way there make an effort to settle with him, so that he may not drag you before the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison."
Luke,12,59,"I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent.”"
Luke,13,1,Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Luke,13,2,"And Jesus said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered this fate?"
Luke,13,3,"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
Luke,13,4,Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem?
Luke,13,5,"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”"
Luke,13,6,And He began telling this parable: “A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any.
Luke,13,7,"And he said to the vineyard-keeper, ‘Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?’"
Luke,13,8,"And he answered and said to him, ‘Let it alone, sir, for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;"
Luke,13,9,"and if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, cut it down.’”"
Luke,13,10,And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke,13,11,"And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all."
Luke,13,12,"When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your sickness.”"
Luke,13,13,And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God.
Luke,13,14,"But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, began saying to the crowd in response, “There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.”"
Luke,13,15,"But the Lord answered him and said, “You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him?"
Luke,13,16,"And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?”"
Luke,13,17,"As He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him."
Luke,13,18,"So He was saying, “What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES.”"
Luke,13,20,"And again He said, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened.”"
Luke,13,22,"And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem."
Luke,13,23,"And someone said to Him, “Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?” And He said to them,"
Luke,13,24,"“Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
Luke,13,25,"Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open up to us!’ then He will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’"
Luke,13,26,"Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets’;"
Luke,13,27,"and He will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from; DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU EVILDOERS.’"
Luke,13,28,"In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out."
Luke,13,29,"And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God."
Luke,13,30,"And behold, some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last.”"
Luke,13,31,"Just at that time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, “Go away, leave here, for Herod wants to kill You.”"
Luke,13,32,"And He said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I reach My goal.’"
Luke,13,33,Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next day; for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.
Luke,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!"
Luke,13,35,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, ‘BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!’”"
Luke,14,1,"It happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely."
Luke,14,2,And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.
Luke,14,3,"And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”"
Luke,14,4,"But they kept silent. And He took hold of him and healed him, and sent him away."
Luke,14,5,"And He said to them, “Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”"
Luke,14,6,And they could make no reply to this.
Luke,14,7,"And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honor at the table, saying to them,"
Luke,14,8,"“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him,"
Luke,14,9,"and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give your place to this man,’ and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place."
Luke,14,10,"But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher’; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you."
Luke,14,11,"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”"
Luke,14,12,"And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment."
Luke,14,13,"But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,"
Luke,14,14,"and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”"
Luke,14,15,"When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, “Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”"
Luke,14,16,"But He said to him, “A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many;"
Luke,14,17,"and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come; for everything is ready now.’"
Luke,14,18,"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, ‘I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.’"
Luke,14,19,"Another one said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.’"
Luke,14,20,"Another one said, ‘I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.’"
Luke,14,21,"And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’"
Luke,14,22,"And the slave said, ‘Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’"
Luke,14,23,"And the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled."
Luke,14,24,"For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.’”"
Luke,14,25,"Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them,"
Luke,14,26,"“If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple."
Luke,14,27,Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
Luke,14,28,"For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?"
Luke,14,29,"Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him,"
Luke,14,30,"saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’"
Luke,14,31,"Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand?"
Luke,14,32,"Or else, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace."
Luke,14,33,"So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions."
Luke,14,34,"“Therefore, salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?"
Luke,14,35,"It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Luke,15,1,Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.
Luke,15,2,"Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them.”"
Luke,15,3,"So He told them this parable, saying,"
Luke,15,4,"“What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?"
Luke,15,5,"When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
Luke,15,6,"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’"
Luke,15,7,"I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?"
Luke,15,9,"When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!’"
Luke,15,10,"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”"
Luke,15,11,"And He said, “A man had two sons."
Luke,15,12,"The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.’ So he divided his wealth between them."
Luke,15,13,"And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living."
Luke,15,14,"Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished."
Luke,15,15,"So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."
Luke,15,16,"And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him."
Luke,15,17,"But when he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!"
Luke,15,18,"I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight;"
Luke,15,19,I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.”’
Luke,15,20,"So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’"
Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;"
Luke,15,23,"and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate;"
Luke,15,24,for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they began to celebrate.
Luke,15,25,"“Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing."
Luke,15,26,And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be.
Luke,15,27,"And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.’"
Luke,15,28,But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him.
Luke,15,29,"But he answered and said to his father, ‘Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends;"
Luke,15,30,"but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’"
Luke,15,31,"And he said to him, ‘Son, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours."
Luke,15,32,"But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.’”"
Luke,16,1,"Now He was also saying to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a manager, and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions."
Luke,16,2,"And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’"
Luke,16,3,"The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg."
Luke,16,4,"I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes.’"
Luke,16,5,"And he summoned each one of his master’s debtors, and he began saying to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’"
Luke,16,6,"And he said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ And he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’"
Luke,16,7,"Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He *said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’"
Luke,16,8,And his master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light.
Luke,16,9,"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings."
Luke,16,10,“He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.
Luke,16,11,"Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?"
Luke,16,12,"And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?"
Luke,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.”"
Luke,16,14,"Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him."
Luke,16,15,"And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God."
Luke,16,16,"“The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it."
Luke,16,17,But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.
Luke,16,18,"“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery."
Luke,16,19,"“Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day."
Luke,16,20,"And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,"
Luke,16,21,"and longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man’s table; besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores."
Luke,16,22,Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.
Luke,16,23,"In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom."
Luke,16,24,"And he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’"
Luke,16,25,"But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony."
Luke,16,26,"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.’"
Luke,16,27,"And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father’s house—"
Luke,16,28,"for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’"
Luke,16,29,"But Abraham *said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’"
Luke,16,30,"But he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!’"
Luke,16,31,"But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.’”"
Luke,17,1,"He said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to him through whom they come!"
Luke,17,2,"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble."
Luke,17,3,"Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him."
Luke,17,4,"And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ forgive him.”"
Luke,17,5,"The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”"
Luke,17,6,"And the Lord said, “If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and be planted in the sea’; and it would obey you."
Luke,17,7,"“Which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down to eat’?"
Luke,17,8,"But will he not say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat, and properly clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink’?"
Luke,17,9,"He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he?"
Luke,17,10,"So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.’”"
Luke,17,11,"While He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee."
Luke,17,12,"As He entered a village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him;"
Luke,17,13,"and they raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”"
Luke,17,14,"When He saw them, He said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they were going, they were cleansed."
Luke,17,15,"Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,"
Luke,17,16,"and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan."
Luke,17,17,"Then Jesus answered and said, “Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine—where are they?"
Luke,17,18,"Was no one found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?”"
Luke,17,19,"And He said to him, “Stand up and go; your faith has made you well.”"
Luke,17,20,"Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, “The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed;"
Luke,17,21,"nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or, ‘There it is!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”"
Luke,17,22,"And He said to the disciples, “The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it."
Luke,17,23,"They will say to you, ‘Look there! Look here!’ Do not go away, and do not run after them."
Luke,17,24,"For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day."
Luke,17,25,But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Luke,17,26,"And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:"
Luke,17,27,"they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,28,"It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;"
Luke,17,29,but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
Luke,17,30,It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,"On that day, the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out; and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back."
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke,17,33,"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it."
Luke,17,34,"I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left."
Luke,17,35,There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke,17,36,[Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.”]
Luke,17,37,"And answering they *said to Him, “Where, Lord?” And He said to them, “Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered.”"
Luke,18,1,"Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart,"
Luke,18,2,"saying, “In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man."
Luke,18,3,"There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, ‘Give me legal protection from my opponent.’"
Luke,18,4,"For a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Even though I do not fear God nor respect man,"
Luke,18,5,"yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out.’”"
Luke,18,6,"And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge *said;"
Luke,18,7,"now, will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them?"
Luke,18,8,"I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?”"
Luke,18,9,"And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:"
Luke,18,10,"“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector."
Luke,18,12,I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.’
Luke,18,13,"But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, the sinner!’"
Luke,18,14,"I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”"
Luke,18,15,"And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they began rebuking them."
Luke,18,16,"But Jesus called for them, saying, “Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Luke,18,17,"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.”"
Luke,18,18,"A ruler questioned Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Luke,18,19,"And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone."
Luke,18,20,"You know the commandments, ‘DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.’”"
Luke,18,21,"And he said, “All these things I have kept from my youth.”"
Luke,18,22,"When Jesus heard this, He said to him, “One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”"
Luke,18,23,"But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich."
Luke,18,24,"And Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"
Luke,18,25,For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
Luke,18,26,"They who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”"
Luke,18,27,"But He said, “The things that are impossible with people are possible with God.”"
Luke,18,28,"Peter said, “Behold, we have left our own homes and followed You.”"
Luke,18,29,"And He said to them, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,"
Luke,18,30,"who will not receive many times as much at this time and in the age to come, eternal life.”"
Luke,18,31,"Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished."
Luke,18,32,"For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon,"
Luke,18,33,"and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and the third day He will rise again.”"
Luke,18,34,"But the disciples understood none of these things, and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said."
Luke,18,35,"As Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging."
Luke,18,36,"Now hearing a crowd going by, he began to inquire what this was."
Luke,18,37,They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
Luke,18,38,"And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Luke,18,39,"Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Luke,18,40,"And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he came near, He questioned him,"
Luke,18,41,"“What do you want Me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, I want to regain my sight!”"
Luke,18,42,"And Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.”"
Luke,18,43,"Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God."
Luke,19,1,He entered Jericho and was passing through.
Luke,19,2,And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich.
Luke,19,3,"Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature."
Luke,19,4,"So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way."
Luke,19,5,"When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, “Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”"
Luke,19,6,And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly.
Luke,19,7,"When they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”"
Luke,19,8,"Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much.”"
Luke,19,9,"And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham."
Luke,19,10,For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”
Luke,19,11,"While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately."
Luke,19,12,"So He said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return."
Luke,19,13,"And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business with this until I come back.’"
Luke,19,14,"But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’"
Luke,19,15,"When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done."
Luke,19,16,"The first appeared, saying, ‘Master, your mina has made ten minas more.’"
Luke,19,17,"And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.’"
Luke,19,18,"The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, master, has made five minas.’"
Luke,19,19,"And he said to him also, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’"
Luke,19,20,"Another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;"
Luke,19,21,"for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.’"
Luke,19,22,"He *said to him, ‘By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?"
Luke,19,23,"Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?’"
Luke,19,24,"Then he said to the bystanders, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’"
Luke,19,25,"And they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas already.’"
Luke,19,26,"I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away."
Luke,19,27,"But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.”"
Luke,19,28,"After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
Luke,19,29,"When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,"
Luke,19,30,"saying, “Go into the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here."
Luke,19,31,"If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of it.’”"
Luke,19,32,So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them.
Luke,19,33,"As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”"
Luke,19,34,"They said, “The Lord has need of it.”"
Luke,19,35,"They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it."
Luke,19,36,"As He was going, they were spreading their coats on the road."
Luke,19,37,"As soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,"
Luke,19,38,shouting: “BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
Luke,19,39,"Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.”"
Luke,19,40,"But Jesus answered, “I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out!”"
Luke,19,41,"When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city and wept over it,"
Luke,19,42,"saying, “If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes."
Luke,19,43,"For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,"
Luke,19,44,"and they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”"
Luke,19,45,"Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling,"
Luke,19,46,"saying to them, “It is written, ‘AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,’ but you have made it a ROBBERS’ DEN.”"
Luke,19,47,"And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him,"
Luke,19,48,"and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to every word He said."
Luke,20,1,"On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted Him,"
Luke,20,2,"and they spoke, saying to Him, “Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?”"
Luke,20,3,"Jesus answered and said to them, “I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me:"
Luke,20,4,Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?”
Luke,20,5,"They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’"
Luke,20,6,"But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”"
Luke,20,7,So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
Luke,20,8,"And Jesus said to them, “Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”"
Luke,20,9,"And He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time."
Luke,20,10,"At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, so that they would give him some of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed."
Luke,20,11,And he proceeded to send another slave; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke,20,12,And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded and cast out.
Luke,20,13,"The owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’"
Luke,20,14,"But when the vine-growers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.’"
Luke,20,15,"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?"
Luke,20,16,"He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”"
Luke,20,17,"But Jesus looked at them and said, “What then is this that is written: ‘THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone’?"
Luke,20,18,"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.”"
Luke,20,19,"The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them."
Luke,20,20,"So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so that they could deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor."
Luke,20,21,"They questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth."
Luke,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”"
Luke,20,23,"But He detected their trickery and said to them,"
Luke,20,24,"“Show Me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar’s.”"
Luke,20,25,"And He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”"
Luke,20,26,"And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people; and being amazed at His answer, they became silent."
Luke,20,27,"Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection),"
Luke,20,28,"and they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN’S BROTHER DIES, having a wife, AND HE IS CHILDLESS, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER."
Luke,20,29,Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless;
Luke,20,30,and the second
Luke,20,31,"and the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children."
Luke,20,32,Finally the woman died also.
Luke,20,33,"In the resurrection therefore, which one’s wife will she be? For all seven had married her.”"
Luke,20,34,"Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,"
Luke,20,35,"but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;"
Luke,20,36,"for they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."
Luke,20,37,"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB."
Luke,20,38,Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live to Him.”
Luke,20,39,"Some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.”"
Luke,20,40,For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything.
Luke,20,41,"Then He said to them, “How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?"
Luke,20,42,"For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, “SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,"
Luke,20,43,UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET.”’
Luke,20,44,"Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord,’ and how is He his son?”"
Luke,20,45,"And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,"
Luke,20,46,"“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love respectful greetings in the market places, and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,"
Luke,20,47,"who devour widows’ houses, and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”"
Luke,21,1,And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke,21,2,And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins.
Luke,21,3,"And He said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them;"
Luke,21,4,for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.”
Luke,21,5,"And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said,"
Luke,21,6,"“As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down.”"
Luke,21,7,"They questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”"
Luke,21,8,"And He said, “See to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not go after them."
Luke,21,9,"When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end does not follow immediately.”"
Luke,21,10,"Then He continued by saying to them, “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,"
Luke,21,11,"and there will be great earthquakes, and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven."
Luke,21,12,"“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name’s sake."
Luke,21,13,It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.
Luke,21,14,So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;
Luke,21,15,for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.
Luke,21,16,"But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death,"
Luke,21,17,and you will be hated by all because of My name.
Luke,21,18,Yet not a hair of your head will perish.
Luke,21,19,By your endurance you will gain your lives.
Luke,21,20,"“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near."
Luke,21,21,"Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city;"
Luke,21,22,"because these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled."
Luke,21,23,Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people;
Luke,21,24,"and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."
Luke,21,25,"“There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,"
Luke,21,26,men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Luke,21,27,Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory.
Luke,21,28,"But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”"
Luke,21,29,Then He told them a parable: “Behold the fig tree and all the trees;
Luke,21,30,"as soon as they put forth leaves, you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near."
Luke,21,31,"So you also, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near."
Luke,21,32,"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place."
Luke,21,33,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
Luke,21,34,"“Be on guard, so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap;"
Luke,21,35,for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth.
Luke,21,36,"But keep on the alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”"
Luke,21,37,"Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet."
Luke,21,38,And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to Him.
Luke,22,1,"Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching."
Luke,22,2,The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
Luke,22,3,"And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve."
Luke,22,4,And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them.
Luke,22,5,They were glad and agreed to give him money.
Luke,22,6,"So he consented, and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the crowd."
Luke,22,7,Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
Luke,22,8,"And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.”"
Luke,22,9,"They said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare it?”"
Luke,22,10,"And He said to them, “When you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters."
Luke,22,11,"And you shall say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’"
Luke,22,12,"And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; prepare it there.”"
Luke,22,13,And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
Luke,22,14,"When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him."
Luke,22,15,"And He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;"
Luke,22,16,"for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,22,17,"And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, “Take this and share it among yourselves;"
Luke,22,18,"for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”"
Luke,22,19,"And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”"
Luke,22,20,"And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood."
Luke,22,21,"But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table."
Luke,22,22,"For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”"
Luke,22,23,And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing.
Luke,22,24,And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest.
Luke,22,25,"And He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called ‘Benefactors.’"
Luke,22,26,"But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant."
Luke,22,27,"For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves."
Luke,22,28,“You are those who have stood by Me in My trials;
Luke,22,29,"and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you"
Luke,22,30,"that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Luke,22,31,"“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat;"
Luke,22,32,"but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.”"
Luke,22,33,"But he said to Him, “Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!”"
Luke,22,34,"And He said, “I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”"
Luke,22,35,"And He said to them, “When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” They said, “No, nothing.”"
Luke,22,36,"And He said to them, “But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, ‘AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS’; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment.”"
Luke,22,38,"They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” And He said to them, “It is enough.”"
Luke,22,39,And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.
Luke,22,40,"When He arrived at the place, He said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”"
Luke,22,41,"And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and began to pray,"
Luke,22,42,"saying, “Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.”"
Luke,22,43,"Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him."
Luke,22,44,"And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground."
Luke,22,45,"When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow,"
Luke,22,46,"and said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”"
Luke,22,47,"While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was preceding them; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him."
Luke,22,48,"But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”"
Luke,22,49,"When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”"
Luke,22,50,And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
Luke,22,51,"But Jesus answered and said, “Stop! No more of this.” And He touched his ear and healed him."
Luke,22,52,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber?"
Luke,22,53,"While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours.”"
Luke,22,54,"Having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him to the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance."
Luke,22,55,"After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them."
Luke,22,56,"And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, “This man was with Him too.”"
Luke,22,57,"But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”"
Luke,22,58,"A little later, another saw him and said, “You are one of them too!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”"
Luke,22,59,"After about an hour had passed, another man began to insist, saying, “Certainly this man also was with Him, for he is a Galilean too.”"
Luke,22,60,"But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed."
Luke,22,61,"The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”"
Luke,22,62,And he went out and wept bitterly.
Luke,22,63,"Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him,"
Luke,22,64,"and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, “Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?”"
Luke,22,65,"And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming."
Luke,22,66,"When it was day, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their council chamber, saying,"
Luke,22,67,"“If You are the Christ, tell us.” But He said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe;"
Luke,22,68,"and if I ask a question, you will not answer."
Luke,22,69,But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD.”
Luke,22,70,"And they all said, “Are You the Son of God, then?” And He said to them, “Yes, I am.”"
Luke,22,71,"Then they said, “What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.”"
Luke,23,1,Then the whole body of them got up and brought Him before Pilate.
Luke,23,2,"And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.”"
Luke,23,3,"So Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He answered him and said, “It is as you say.”"
Luke,23,4,"Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no guilt in this man.”"
Luke,23,5,"But they kept on insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as this place.”"
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean."
Luke,23,7,"And when he learned that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,"Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him."
Luke,23,9,And he questioned Him at some length; but He answered him nothing.
Luke,23,10,"And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vehemently."
Luke,23,11,"And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate."
Luke,23,12,Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been enemies with each other.
Luke,23,13,"Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
Luke,23,14,"and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him."
Luke,23,15,"No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him."
Luke,23,16,Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”
Luke,23,17,[Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner.]
Luke,23,18,"But they cried out all together, saying, “Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!”"
Luke,23,19,"(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder.)"
Luke,23,20,"Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,"
Luke,23,21,"but they kept on calling out, saying, “Crucify, crucify Him!”"
Luke,23,22,"And he said to them the third time, “Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”"
Luke,23,23,"But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices began to prevail."
Luke,23,24,And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted.
Luke,23,25,"And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will."
Luke,23,26,"When they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus."
Luke,23,27,"And following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him."
Luke,23,28,"But Jesus turning to them said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children."
Luke,23,29,"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’"
Luke,23,30,"Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, ‘FALL ON US,’ AND TO THE HILLS, ‘COVER US.’"
Luke,23,31,"For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”"
Luke,23,32,"Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him."
Luke,23,33,"When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left."
Luke,23,34,"But Jesus was saying, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.” And they cast lots, dividing up His garments among themselves."
Luke,23,35,"And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One.”"
Luke,23,36,"The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine,"
Luke,23,37,"and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!”"
Luke,23,38,"Now there was also an inscription above Him, “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
Luke,23,39,"One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”"
Luke,23,40,"But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?"
Luke,23,41,"And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.”"
Luke,23,42,"And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!”"
Luke,23,43,"And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.”"
Luke,23,44,"It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,"
Luke,23,45,because the sun was obscured; and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
Luke,23,46,"And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.” Having said this, He breathed His last."
Luke,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began praising God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent.”"
Luke,23,48,"And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, began to return, beating their breasts."
Luke,23,49,"And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things."
Luke,23,50,"And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man"
Luke,23,51,"(he had not consented to their plan and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God;"
Luke,23,52,this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke,23,53,"And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain."
Luke,23,54,"It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin."
Luke,23,55,"Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid."
Luke,23,56,Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
Luke,24,1,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared."
Luke,24,2,"And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,"
Luke,24,3,"but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus."
Luke,24,4,"While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing;"
Luke,24,5,"and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living One among the dead?"
Luke,24,6,"He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,"
Luke,24,7,"saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.”"
Luke,24,8,"And they remembered His words,"
Luke,24,9,and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
Luke,24,10,Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.
Luke,24,11,"But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them."
Luke,24,12,"But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened."
Luke,24,13,"And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,14,And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.
Luke,24,15,"While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them."
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.
Luke,24,17,"And He said to them, “What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?” And they stood still, looking sad."
Luke,24,18,"One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, “Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?”"
Luke,24,19,"And He said to them, “What things?” And they said to Him, “The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,"
Luke,24,20,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him."
Luke,24,21,"But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened."
Luke,24,22,"But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,"
Luke,24,23,"and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive."
Luke,24,24,Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.”
Luke,24,25,"And He said to them, “O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!"
Luke,24,26,Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?”
Luke,24,27,"Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures."
Luke,24,28,"And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther."
Luke,24,29,"But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.” So He went in to stay with them."
Luke,24,30,"When He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and breaking it, He began giving it to them."
Luke,24,31,Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.
Luke,24,32,"They said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?”"
Luke,24,33,"And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them,"
Luke,24,34,"saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.”"
Luke,24,35,They began to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
Luke,24,36,"While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and *said to them, “Peace be to you.”"
Luke,24,37,But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit.
Luke,24,38,"And He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?"
Luke,24,39,"See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”"
Luke,24,40,"And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet."
Luke,24,41,"While they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”"
Luke,24,42,They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish;
Luke,24,43,and He took it and ate it before them.
Luke,24,44,"Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”"
Luke,24,45,"Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,"
Luke,24,46,"and He said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,"
Luke,24,47,"and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,48,You are witnesses of these things.
Luke,24,49,"And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”"
Luke,24,50,"And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them."
Luke,24,51,"While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven."
Luke,24,52,"And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,"
Luke,24,53,and were continually in the temple praising God.
John,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
John,1,2,He was in the beginning with God.
John,1,3,"All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being."
John,1,4,"In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men."
John,1,5,"The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it."
John,1,6,"There came a man sent from God, whose name was John."
John,1,7,"He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him."
John,1,8,"He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light."
John,1,9,"There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man."
John,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him."
John,1,11,"He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him."
John,1,12,"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,"
John,1,13,"who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."
John,1,14,"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."
John,1,15,"John *testified about Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’”"
John,1,16,"For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace."
John,1,17,For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
John,1,18,"No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him."
John,1,19,"This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”"
John,1,20,"And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”"
John,1,21,"They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he *said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”"
John,1,22,"Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”"
John,1,23,"He said, “I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”"
John,1,24,Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
John,1,25,"They asked him, and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”"
John,1,26,"John answered them saying, “I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know."
John,1,27,"It is He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”"
John,1,28,"These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
John,1,29,"The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him and *said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"
John,1,30,"This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’"
John,1,31,"I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.”"
John,1,32,"John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him."
John,1,33,"I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’"
John,1,34,"I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”"
John,1,35,"Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,"
John,1,36,"and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and *said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”"
John,1,37,"The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
John,1,38,"And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, “What do you seek?” They said to Him, “Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?”"
John,1,39,"He *said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour."
John,1,40,"One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother."
John,1,41,"He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ)."
John,1,42,"He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter)."
John,1,43,"The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, “Follow Me.”"
John,1,44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter."
John,1,45,"Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”"
John,1,46,"Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip *said to him, “Come and see.”"
John,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”"
John,1,48,"Nathanael *said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”"
John,1,49,"Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.”"
John,1,50,"Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”"
John,1,51,"And He *said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"
John,2,1,"On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;"
John,2,2,and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
John,2,3,"When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, “They have no wine.”"
John,2,4,"And Jesus *said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come.”"
John,2,5,"His mother *said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.”"
John,2,6,"Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each."
John,2,7,"Jesus *said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim."
John,2,8,"And He *said to them, “Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.” So they took it to him."
John,2,9,"When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the bridegroom,"
John,2,10,"and *said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.”"
John,2,11,"This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him."
John,2,12,"After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days."
John,2,13,"The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,2,14,"And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables."
John,2,15,"And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;"
John,2,16,"and to those who were selling the doves He said, “Take these things away; stop making My Father’s house a place of business.”"
John,2,17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, “ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME.”"
John,2,18,"The Jews then said to Him, “What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?”"
John,2,19,"Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”"
John,2,20,"The Jews then said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”"
John,2,21,But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
John,2,22,"So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken."
John,2,23,"Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing."
John,2,24,"But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men,"
John,2,25,"and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man."
John,3,1,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;"
John,3,2,"this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.”"
John,3,3,"Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”"
John,3,4,"Nicodemus *said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?”"
John,3,5,"Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
John,3,6,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
John,3,7,"Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’"
John,3,8,"The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”"
John,3,9,"Nicodemus said to Him, “How can these things be?”"
John,3,10,"Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?"
John,3,11,"Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony."
John,3,12,"If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"
John,3,13,"No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man."
John,3,14,"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;"
John,3,15,so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.
John,3,16,"“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
John,3,17,"For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him."
John,3,18,"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
John,3,19,"This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil."
John,3,20,"For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed."
John,3,21,"But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.”"
John,3,22,"After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing."
John,3,23,"John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people were coming and were being baptized—"
John,3,24,for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
John,3,25,Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification.
John,3,26,"And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.”"
John,3,27,"John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven."
John,3,28,"You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent ahead of Him.’"
John,3,29,"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine has been made full."
John,3,30,"He must increase, but I must decrease."
John,3,31,"“He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all."
John,3,32,"What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony."
John,3,33,"He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true."
John,3,34,For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.
John,3,35,The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.
John,3,36,"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”"
John,4,1,Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
John,4,2,"(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),"
John,4,3,He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.
John,4,4,And He had to pass through Samaria.
John,4,5,"So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;"
John,4,6,"and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour."
John,4,7,"There *came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus *said to her, “Give Me a drink.”"
John,4,8,For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
John,4,9,"Therefore the Samaritan woman *said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)"
John,4,10,"Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”"
John,4,11,"She *said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water?"
John,4,12,"You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?”"
John,4,13,"Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again;"
John,4,14,but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”
John,4,15,"The woman *said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw.”"
John,4,16,"He *said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”"
John,4,17,"The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” Jesus *said to her, “You have correctly said, ‘I have no husband’;"
John,4,18,"for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.”"
John,4,19,"The woman *said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet."
John,4,20,"Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.”"
John,4,21,"Jesus *said to her, “Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father."
John,4,22,"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews."
John,4,23,"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers."
John,4,24,"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”"
John,4,25,"The woman *said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.”"
John,4,26,"Jesus *said to her, “I who speak to you am He.”"
John,4,27,"At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why do You speak with her?”"
John,4,28,"So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and *said to the men,"
John,4,29,"“Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is it?”"
John,4,30,"They went out of the city, and were coming to Him."
John,4,31,"Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”"
John,4,32,"But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”"
John,4,33,"So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?”"
John,4,34,"Jesus *said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work."
John,4,35,"Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest."
John,4,36,Already he who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
John,4,37,"For in this case the saying is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’"
John,4,38,I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor.”
John,4,39,"From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the things that I have done.”"
John,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days."
John,4,41,Many more believed because of His word;
John,4,42,"and they were saying to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world.”"
John,4,43,After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee.
John,4,44,For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
John,4,45,"So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast."
John,4,46,Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.
John,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death."
John,4,48,"So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.”"
John,4,49,"The royal official *said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”"
John,4,50,"Jesus *said to him, “Go; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off."
John,4,51,"As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was living."
John,4,52,"So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”"
John,4,53,"So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives”; and he himself believed and his whole household."
John,4,54,This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
John,5,1,"After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,5,2,"Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes."
John,5,3,"In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters;"
John,5,4,"for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.]"
John,5,5,A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.
John,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He *said to him, “Do you wish to get well?”"
John,5,7,"The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”"
John,5,8,"Jesus *said to him, “Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.”"
John,5,9,"Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk. Now it was the Sabbath on that day."
John,5,10,"So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.”"
John,5,11,"But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, ‘Pick up your pallet and walk.’”"
John,5,12,"They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your pallet and walk’?”"
John,5,13,"But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place."
John,5,14,"Afterward Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.”"
John,5,15,"The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well."
John,5,16,"For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath."
John,5,17,"But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.”"
John,5,18,"For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."
John,5,19,"Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner."
John,5,20,"For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel."
John,5,21,"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes."
John,5,22,"For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,"
John,5,23,so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
John,5,24,"“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."
John,5,25,"Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live."
John,5,26,"For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;"
John,5,27,"and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man."
John,5,28,"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,"
John,5,29,"and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment."
John,5,30,"“I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."
John,5,31,"“If I alone testify about Myself, My testimony is not true."
John,5,32,"There is another who testifies of Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true."
John,5,33,"You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth."
John,5,34,"But the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved."
John,5,35,He was the lamp that was burning and was shining and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
John,5,36,"But the testimony which I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me."
John,5,37,"And the Father who sent Me, He has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form."
John,5,38,"You do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent."
John,5,39,You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;
John,5,40,and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.
John,5,41,I do not receive glory from men;
John,5,42,"but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves."
John,5,43,"I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him."
John,5,44,"How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?"
John,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope."
John,5,46,"For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me."
John,5,47,"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”"
John,6,1,After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).
John,6,2,"A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick."
John,6,3,"Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples."
John,6,4,"Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near."
John,6,5,"Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread, so that these may eat?”"
John,6,6,"This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do."
John,6,7,"Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little.”"
John,6,8,"One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, *said to Him,"
John,6,9,"“There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?”"
John,6,10,"Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
John,6,11,"Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted."
John,6,12,"When they were filled, He *said to His disciples, “Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost.”"
John,6,13,"So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten."
John,6,14,"Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”"
John,6,15,"So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone."
John,6,16,"Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,"
John,6,17,"and after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them."
John,6,18,The sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.
John,6,19,"Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened."
John,6,20,"But He *said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.”"
John,6,21,"So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going."
John,6,22,"The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone."
John,6,23,There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John,6,24,"So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus."
John,6,25,"When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”"
John,6,26,"Jesus answered them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled."
John,6,27,"Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.”"
John,6,28,"Therefore they said to Him, “What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?”"
John,6,29,"Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.”"
John,6,30,"So they said to Him, “What then do You do for a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform?"
John,6,31,"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.’”"
John,6,32,"Jesus then said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven."
John,6,33,"For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.”"
John,6,34,"Then they said to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”"
John,6,35,"Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst."
John,6,36,"But I said to you that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe."
John,6,37,"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out."
John,6,38,"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."
John,6,39,"This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day."
John,6,40,"For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.”"
John,6,41,"Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him, because He said, “I am the bread that came down out of heaven.”"
John,6,42,"They were saying, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, ‘I have come down out of heaven’?”"
John,6,43,"Jesus answered and said to them, “Do not grumble among yourselves."
John,6,44,No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
John,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, ‘AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me."
John,6,46,"Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father."
John,6,47,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life."
John,6,48,I am the bread of life.
John,6,49,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died."
John,6,50,"This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die."
John,6,51,"I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh.”"
John,6,52,"Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”"
John,6,53,"So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves."
John,6,54,"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day."
John,6,55,"For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink."
John,6,56,"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him."
John,6,57,"As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me."
John,6,58,This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.”
John,6,59,These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
John,6,60,"Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this said, “This is a difficult statement; who can listen to it?”"
John,6,61,"But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, “Does this cause you to stumble?"
John,6,62,What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
John,6,63,It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
John,6,64,"But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him."
John,6,65,"And He was saying, “For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.”"
John,6,66,As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore.
John,6,67,"So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”"
John,6,68,"Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life."
John,6,69,We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.”
John,6,70,"Jesus answered them, “Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?”"
John,6,71,"Now He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him."
John,7,1,"After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him."
John,7,2,"Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near."
John,7,3,"Therefore His brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing."
John,7,4,"For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.”"
John,7,5,For not even His brothers were believing in Him.
John,7,6,"So Jesus *said to them, “My time is not yet here, but your time is always opportune."
John,7,7,"The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil."
John,7,8,Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come.”
John,7,9,"Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee."
John,7,10,"But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret."
John,7,11,"So the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying, “Where is He?”"
John,7,12,"There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him; some were saying, “He is a good man”; others were saying, “No, on the contrary, He leads the people astray.”"
John,7,13,Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
John,7,14,"But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and began to teach."
John,7,15,"The Jews then were astonished, saying, “How has this man become learned, having never been educated?”"
John,7,16,"So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me."
John,7,17,"If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself."
John,7,18,"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him."
John,7,19,"“Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?”"
John,7,20,"The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?”"
John,7,21,"Jesus answered them, “I did one deed, and you all marvel."
John,7,22,"For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man."
John,7,23,"If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?"
John,7,24,"Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”"
John,7,25,"So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill?"
John,7,26,"Look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they?"
John,7,27,"However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from.”"
John,7,28,"Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know."
John,7,29,"I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.”"
John,7,30,"So they were seeking to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come."
John,7,31,"But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, “When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?”"
John,7,32,"The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him."
John,7,33,"Therefore Jesus said, “For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me."
John,7,34,"You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”"
John,7,35,"The Jews then said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He?"
John,7,36,"What is this statement that He said, ‘You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come’?”"
John,7,37,"Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink."
John,7,38,"He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”"
John,7,39,"But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
John,7,40,"Some of the people therefore, when they heard these words, were saying, “This certainly is the Prophet.”"
John,7,41,"Others were saying, “This is the Christ.” Still others were saying, “Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He?"
John,7,42,"Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”"
John,7,43,So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.
John,7,44,"Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him."
John,7,45,"The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?”"
John,7,46,"The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks.”"
John,7,47,"The Pharisees then answered them, “You have not also been led astray, have you?"
John,7,48,"No one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he?"
John,7,49,But this crowd which does not know the Law is accursed.”
John,7,50,"Nicodemus (he who came to Him before, being one of them) *said to them,"
John,7,51,"“Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?”"
John,7,52,"They answered him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.”"
John,7,53,[Everyone went to his home.
John,8,1,But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John,8,2,"Early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and began to teach them."
John,8,3,"The scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center of the court,"
John,8,4,"they *said to Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act."
John,8,5,Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?”
John,8,6,"They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground."
John,8,7,"But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”"
John,8,8,Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
John,8,9,"When they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center of the court."
John,8,10,"Straightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”"
John,8,11,"She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more.”]"
John,8,12,"Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”"
John,8,13,"So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not true.”"
John,8,14,"Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going."
John,8,15,You judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.
John,8,16,"But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me."
John,8,17,Even in your law it has been written that the testimony of two men is true.
John,8,18,"I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me.”"
John,8,19,"So they were saying to Him, “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.”"
John,8,20,"These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come."
John,8,21,"Then He said again to them, “I go away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come.”"
John,8,22,"So the Jews were saying, “Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”"
John,8,23,"And He was saying to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world."
John,8,24,"Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”"
John,8,25,"So they were saying to Him, “Who are You?” Jesus said to them, “What have I been saying to you from the beginning?"
John,8,26,"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I speak to the world.”"
John,8,27,They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father.
John,8,28,"So Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me."
John,8,29,"And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.”"
John,8,30,"As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him."
John,8,31,"So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine;"
John,8,32,"and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”"
John,8,33,"They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, ‘You will become free’?”"
John,8,34,"Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin."
John,8,35,The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.
John,8,36,"So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
John,8,37,"I know that you are Abraham’s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you."
John,8,38,I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father.”
John,8,39,"They answered and said to Him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus *said to them, “If you are Abraham’s children, do the deeds of Abraham."
John,8,40,"But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do."
John,8,41,"You are doing the deeds of your father.” They said to Him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God.”"
John,8,42,"Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me."
John,8,43,Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word.
John,8,44,"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
John,8,45,"But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me."
John,8,46,"Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?"
John,8,47,"He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.”"
John,8,48,"The Jews answered and said to Him, “Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”"
John,8,49,"Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me."
John,8,50,But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges.
John,8,51,"Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he will never see death.”"
John,8,52,"The Jews said to Him, “Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, ‘If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste of death.’"
John,8,53,"Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be?”"
John,8,54,"Jesus answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God’;"
John,8,55,"and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word."
John,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.”"
John,8,57,"So the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?”"
John,8,58,"Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.”"
John,8,59,"Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple."
John,9,1,"As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth."
John,9,2,"And His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?”"
John,9,3,"Jesus answered, “It was neither that this man sinned, nor his parents; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him."
John,9,4,We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work.
John,9,5,"While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.”"
John,9,6,"When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes,"
John,9,7,"and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing."
John,9,8,"Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, “Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?”"
John,9,9,"Others were saying, “This is he,” still others were saying, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am the one.”"
John,9,10,"So they were saying to him, “How then were your eyes opened?”"
John,9,11,"He answered, “The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash’; so I went away and washed, and I received sight.”"
John,9,12,"They said to him, “Where is He?” He *said, “I do not know.”"
John,9,13,They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind.
John,9,14,Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
John,9,15,"Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, “He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”"
John,9,16,"Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others were saying, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And there was a division among them."
John,9,17,"So they *said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”"
John,9,18,"The Jews then did not believe it of him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,"
John,9,19,"and questioned them, saying, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”"
John,9,20,"His parents answered them and said, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;"
John,9,21,"but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.”"
John,9,22,"His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue."
John,9,23,"For this reason his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”"
John,9,24,"So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”"
John,9,25,"He then answered, “Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”"
John,9,26,"So they said to him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”"
John,9,27,"He answered them, “I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?”"
John,9,28,"They reviled him and said, “You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses."
John,9,29,"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.”"
John,9,30,"The man answered and said to them, “Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes."
John,9,31,"We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him."
John,9,32,Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
John,9,33,"If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.”"
John,9,34,"They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?” So they put him out."
John,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”"
John,9,36,"He answered, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?”"
John,9,37,"Jesus said to him, “You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you.”"
John,9,38,"And he said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped Him."
John,9,39,"And Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.”"
John,9,40,"Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, “We are not blind too, are we?”"
John,9,41,"Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains."
John,10,1,"“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber."
John,10,2,But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
John,10,3,"To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out."
John,10,4,"When he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice."
John,10,5,"A stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”"
John,10,6,"This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them."
John,10,7,"So Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
John,10,8,"All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them."
John,10,9,"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture."
John,10,10,"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly."
John,10,11,“I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
John,10,12,"He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them."
John,10,13,He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep.
John,10,14,"I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me,"
John,10,15,even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.
John,10,16,"I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd."
John,10,17,"For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again."
John,10,18,"No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.”"
John,10,19,A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.
John,10,20,"Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?”"
John,10,21,"Others were saying, “These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?”"
John,10,22,At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem;
John,10,23,"it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon."
John,10,24,"The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”"
John,10,25,"Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father’s name, these testify of Me."
John,10,26,But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.
John,10,27,"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;"
John,10,28,"and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand."
John,10,29,"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand."
John,10,30,I and the Father are one.”
John,10,31,The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.
John,10,32,"Jesus answered them, “I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?”"
John,10,33,"The Jews answered Him, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.”"
John,10,34,"Jesus answered them, “Has it not been written in your Law, ‘I SAID, YOU ARE GODS’?"
John,10,35,"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),"
John,10,36,"do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?"
John,10,37,"If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;"
John,10,38,"but if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.”"
John,10,39,"Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp."
John,10,40,"And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there."
John,10,41,"Many came to Him and were saying, “While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true.”"
John,10,42,Many believed in Him there.
John,11,1,"Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha."
John,11,2,"It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick."
John,11,3,"So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.”"
John,11,4,"But when Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”"
John,11,5,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John,11,6,"So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was."
John,11,7,"Then after this He *said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”"
John,11,8,"The disciples *said to Him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?”"
John,11,9,"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
John,11,10,"But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”"
John,11,11,"This He said, and after that He *said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep.”"
John,11,12,"The disciples then said to Him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”"
John,11,13,"Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep."
John,11,14,"So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,"
John,11,15,"and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.”"
John,11,16,"Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.”"
John,11,17,"So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days."
John,11,18,"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;"
John,11,19,"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother."
John,11,20,"Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house."
John,11,21,"Martha then said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."
John,11,22,"Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.”"
John,11,23,"Jesus *said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”"
John,11,24,"Martha *said to Him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”"
John,11,25,"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,"
John,11,26,and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”
John,11,27,"She *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into the world.”"
John,11,28,"When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”"
John,11,29,"And when she heard it, she *got up quickly and was coming to Him."
John,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him."
John,11,31,"Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there."
John,11,32,"Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”"
John,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled,"
John,11,34,"and said, “Where have you laid him?” They *said to Him, “Lord, come and see.”"
John,11,35,Jesus wept.
John,11,36,"So the Jews were saying, “See how He loved him!”"
John,11,37,"But some of them said, “Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?”"
John,11,38,"So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it."
John,11,39,"Jesus *said, “Remove the stone.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, “Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.”"
John,11,40,"Jesus *said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”"
John,11,41,"So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me."
John,11,42,"I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.”"
John,11,43,"When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth.”"
John,11,44,"The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”"
John,11,45,"Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him."
John,11,46,But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.
John,11,47,"Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs."
John,11,48,"If we let Him go on like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”"
John,11,49,"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,"
John,11,50,"nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”"
John,11,51,"Now he did not say this on his own initiative, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,"
John,11,52,"and not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad."
John,11,53,So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.
John,11,54,"Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples."
John,11,55,"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves."
John,11,56,"So they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?”"
John,11,57,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might seize Him."
John,12,1,"Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead."
John,12,2,"So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him."
John,12,3,"Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
John,12,4,"But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said,"
John,12,5,“Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?”
John,12,6,"Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it."
John,12,7,"Therefore Jesus said, “Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial."
John,12,8,"For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.”"
John,12,9,"The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead."
John,12,10,But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also;
John,12,11,because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.
John,12,12,"On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
John,12,13,"took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, “Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel.”"
John,12,14,"Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,"
John,12,15,"“FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY’S COLT.”"
John,12,16,"These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him."
John,12,17,"So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify about Him."
John,12,18,"For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign."
John,12,19,"So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him.”"
John,12,20,Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;
John,12,21,"these then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and began to ask him, saying, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”"
John,12,22,Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus.
John,12,23,"And Jesus *answered them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
John,12,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
John,12,25,"He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal."
John,12,26,"If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him."
John,12,27,"“Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But for this purpose I came to this hour."
John,12,28,"Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came out of heaven: “I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.”"
John,12,29,"So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, “An angel has spoken to Him.”"
John,12,30,"Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes."
John,12,31,Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
John,12,32,"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.”"
John,12,33,But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die.
John,12,34,"The crowd then answered Him, “We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”"
John,12,35,"So Jesus said to them, “For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes."
John,12,36,"While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light.” These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them."
John,12,37,"But though He had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him."
John,12,38,"This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: “LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?”"
John,12,39,"For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,"
John,12,40,"“HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM.”"
John,12,41,"These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him."
John,12,42,"Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue;"
John,12,43,for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
John,12,44,"And Jesus cried out and said, “He who believes in Me, does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me."
John,12,45,He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me.
John,12,46,"I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness."
John,12,47,"If anyone hears My sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world."
John,12,48,"He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day."
John,12,49,"For I did not speak on My own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak."
John,12,50,"I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me.”"
John,13,1,"Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end."
John,13,2,"During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him,"
John,13,3,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God,"
John,13,4,"*got up from supper, and *laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself."
John,13,5,"Then He *poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded."
John,13,6,"So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, “Lord, do You wash my feet?”"
John,13,7,"Jesus answered and said to him, “What I do you do not realize now, but you will understand hereafter.”"
John,13,8,"Peter *said to Him, “Never shall You wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”"
John,13,9,"Simon Peter *said to Him, “Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.”"
John,13,10,"Jesus *said to him, “He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.”"
John,13,11,"For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, “Not all of you are clean.”"
John,13,12,"So when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?"
John,13,13,"You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am."
John,13,14,"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet."
John,13,15,For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.
John,13,16,"Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him."
John,13,17,"If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them."
John,13,18,"I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘HE WHO EATS MY BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST ME.’"
John,13,19,"From now on I am telling you before it comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am He."
John,13,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.”"
John,13,21,"When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me.”"
John,13,22,"The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking."
John,13,23,"There was reclining on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved."
John,13,24,"So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.”"
John,13,25,"He, leaning back thus on Jesus’ bosom, *said to Him, “Lord, who is it?”"
John,13,26,"Jesus then *answered, “That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him.” So when He had dipped the morsel, He *took and *gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot."
John,13,27,"After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”"
John,13,28,Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.
John,13,29,"For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, “Buy the things we have need of for the feast”; or else, that he should give something to the poor."
John,13,30,So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.
John,13,31,"Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;"
John,13,32,"if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately."
John,13,33,"Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’"
John,13,34,"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another."
John,13,35,"By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”"
John,13,36,"Simon Peter *said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus answered, “Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later.”"
John,13,37,"Peter *said to Him, “Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You.”"
John,13,38,"Jesus *answered, “Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times."
John,14,1,"“Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me."
John,14,2,"In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you."
John,14,3,"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also."
John,14,4,And you know the way where I am going.”
John,14,5,"Thomas *said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?”"
John,14,6,"Jesus *said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me."
John,14,7,"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him.”"
John,14,8,"Philip *said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”"
John,14,9,"Jesus *said to him, “Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?"
John,14,10,"Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works."
John,14,11,Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves.
John,14,12,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father."
John,14,13,"Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
John,14,14,"If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it."
John,14,15,"“If you love Me, you will keep My commandments."
John,14,16,"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;"
John,14,17,"that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you."
John,14,18,“I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
John,14,19,"After a little while the world will no longer see Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also."
John,14,20,"In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
John,14,21,"He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.”"
John,14,22,"Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, “Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?”"
John,14,23,"Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him."
John,14,24,"He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me."
John,14,25,“These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you.
John,14,26,"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you."
John,14,27,"Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful."
John,14,28,"You heard that I said to you, ‘I go away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I."
John,14,29,"Now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe."
John,14,30,"I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;"
John,14,31,"but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up, let us go from here."
John,15,1,"“I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser."
John,15,2,"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit."
John,15,3,You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
John,15,4,"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me."
John,15,5,"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing."
John,15,6,"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned."
John,15,7,"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
John,15,8,"My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples."
John,15,9,"Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love."
John,15,10,"If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love."
John,15,11,"These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full."
John,15,12,"“This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you."
John,15,13,"Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends."
John,15,14,You are My friends if you do what I command you.
John,15,15,"No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you."
John,15,16,"You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you."
John,15,17,"This I command you, that you love one another."
John,15,18,"“If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you."
John,15,19,"If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you."
John,15,20,"Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also."
John,15,21,"But all these things they will do to you for My name’s sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me."
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin."
John,15,23,He who hates Me hates My Father also.
John,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well."
John,15,25,"But they have done this to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, ‘THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.’"
John,15,26,"“When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me,"
John,15,27,"and you will testify also, because you have been with Me from the beginning."
John,16,1,“These things I have spoken to you so that you may be kept from stumbling.
John,16,2,"They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God."
John,16,3,These things they will do because they have not known the Father or Me.
John,16,4,"But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. These things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you."
John,16,5,"“But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’"
John,16,6,"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart."
John,16,7,"But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."
John,16,8,"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment;"
John,16,9,"concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me;"
John,16,10,"and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer see Me;"
John,16,11,"and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged."
John,16,12,"“I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now."
John,16,13,"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come."
John,16,14,"He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you."
John,16,15,All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.
John,16,16,"“A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me.”"
John,16,17,"Some of His disciples then said to one another, “What is this thing He is telling us, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’; and, ‘because I go to the Father’?”"
John,16,18,"So they were saying, “What is this that He says, ‘A little while’? We do not know what He is talking about.”"
John,16,19,"Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, “Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me’?"
John,16,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy."
John,16,21,"Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain, because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world."
John,16,22,"Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you."
John,16,23,"In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you."
John,16,24,"Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full."
John,16,25,"“These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly of the Father."
John,16,26,"In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf;"
John,16,27,"for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father."
John,16,28,I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; I am leaving the world again and going to the Father.”
John,16,29,"His disciples *said, “Lo, now You are speaking plainly and are not using a figure of speech."
John,16,30,"Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God.”"
John,16,31,"Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?"
John,16,32,"Behold, an hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me."
John,16,33,"These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.”"
John,17,1,"Jesus spoke these things; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You,"
John,17,2,"even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life."
John,17,3,"This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."
John,17,4,"I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do."
John,17,5,"Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was."
John,17,6,"“I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word."
John,17,7,Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You;
John,17,8,"for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me."
John,17,9,"I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;"
John,17,10,"and all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them."
John,17,11,"I am no longer in the world; and yet they themselves are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are."
John,17,12,"While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled."
John,17,13,But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.
John,17,14,"I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
John,17,15,"I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one."
John,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
John,17,17,Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
John,17,18,"As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world."
John,17,19,"For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth."
John,17,20,"“I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word;"
John,17,21,"that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me."
John,17,22,"The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one;"
John,17,23,"I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me."
John,17,24,"Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world."
John,17,25,"“O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me;"
John,17,26,"and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.”"
John,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, in which He entered with His disciples."
John,18,2,"Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples."
John,18,3,"Judas then, having received the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, *came there with lanterns and torches and weapons."
John,18,4,"So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and *said to them, “Whom do you seek?”"
John,18,5,"They answered Him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He *said to them, “I am He.” And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them."
John,18,6,"So when He said to them, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground."
John,18,7,"Therefore He again asked them, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”"
John,18,8,"Jesus answered, “I told you that I am He; so if you seek Me, let these go their way,”"
John,18,9,"to fulfill the word which He spoke, “Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one.”"
John,18,10,"Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave’s name was Malchus."
John,18,11,"So Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?”"
John,18,12,"So the Roman cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him,"
John,18,13,"and led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year."
John,18,14,Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
John,18,15,"Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest,"
John,18,16,"but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in."
John,18,17,"Then the slave-girl who kept the door *said to Peter, “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He *said, “I am not.”"
John,18,18,"Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself."
John,18,19,"The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching."
John,18,20,"Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret."
John,18,21,Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them; they know what I said.”
John,18,22,"When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, “Is that the way You answer the high priest?”"
John,18,23,"Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?”"
John,18,24,So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
John,18,25,"Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You are not also one of His disciples, are you?” He denied it, and said, “I am not.”"
John,18,26,"One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?”"
John,18,27,"Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed."
John,18,28,"Then they *led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover."
John,18,29,"Therefore Pilate went out to them and *said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?”"
John,18,30,"They answered and said to him, “If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him to you.”"
John,18,31,"So Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “We are not permitted to put anyone to death,”"
John,18,32,"to fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die."
John,18,33,"Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”"
John,18,34,"Jesus answered, “Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?”"
John,18,35,"Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me; what have You done?”"
John,18,36,"Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.”"
John,18,37,"Therefore Pilate said to Him, “So You are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say correctly that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”"
John,18,38,"Pilate *said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and *said to them, “I find no guilt in Him."
John,18,39,But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?”
John,18,40,"So they cried out again, saying, “Not this Man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a robber."
John,19,1,Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him.
John,19,2,"And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him;"
John,19,3,"and they began to come up to Him and say, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and to give Him slaps in the face."
John,19,4,"Pilate came out again and *said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him.”"
John,19,5,"Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate *said to them, “Behold, the Man!”"
John,19,6,"So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, “Crucify, crucify!” Pilate *said to them, “Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him.”"
John,19,7,"The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out to be the Son of God.”"
John,19,8,"Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid;"
John,19,9,"and he entered into the Praetorium again and *said to Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus gave him no answer."
John,19,10,"So Pilate *said to Him, “You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?”"
John,19,11,"Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.”"
John,19,12,"As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, “If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar.”"
John,19,13,"Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
John,19,14,"Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”"
John,19,15,"So they cried out, “Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!” Pilate *said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”"
John,19,16,So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.
John,19,17,"They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha."
John,19,18,"There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between."
John,19,19,"Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, “JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
John,19,20,"Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin and in Greek."
John,19,21,"So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’; but that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”"
John,19,22,"Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”"
John,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece."
John,19,24,"So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be”; this was to fulfill the Scripture: “THEY DIVIDED MY OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS.”"
John,19,25,"Therefore the soldiers did these things. But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
John,19,26,"When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”"
John,19,27,"Then He *said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that hour the disciple took her into his own household."
John,19,28,"After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, *said, “I am thirsty.”"
John,19,29,A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.
John,19,30,"Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit."
John,19,31,"Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
John,19,32,"So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him;"
John,19,33,"but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs."
John,19,34,"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out."
John,19,35,"And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe."
John,19,36,"For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, “NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN.”"
John,19,37,"And again another Scripture says, “THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED.”"
John,19,38,"After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body."
John,19,39,"Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight."
John,19,40,"So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews."
John,19,41,"Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid."
John,19,42,"Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."
John,20,1,"Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it *was still dark, and *saw the stone already taken away from the tomb."
John,20,2,"So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.”"
John,20,3,"So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb."
John,20,4,The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first;
John,20,5,"and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying there; but he did not go in."
John,20,6,"And so Simon Peter also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying there,"
John,20,7,"and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself."
John,20,8,"So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed."
John,20,9,"For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead."
John,20,10,So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
John,20,11,"But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;"
John,20,12,"and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying."
John,20,13,"And they *said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She *said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.”"
John,20,14,"When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus."
John,20,15,"Jesus *said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing Him to be the gardener, she *said to Him, “Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.”"
John,20,16,"Jesus *said to her, “Mary!” She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means, Teacher)."
John,20,17,"Jesus *said to her, “Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, ‘I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.’”"
John,20,18,"Mary Magdalene *came, announcing to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that He had said these things to her."
John,20,19,"So when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and *said to them, “Peace be with you.”"
John,20,20,"And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord."
John,20,21,"So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.”"
John,20,22,"And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit."
John,20,23,"If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”"
John,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
John,20,25,"So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”"
John,20,26,"After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, “Peace be with you.”"
John,20,27,"Then He *said to Thomas, “Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.”"
John,20,28,"Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”"
John,20,29,"Jesus *said to him, “Because you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.”"
John,20,30,"Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;"
John,20,31,"but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name."
John,21,1,"After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested Himself in this way."
John,21,2,"Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together."
John,21,3,"Simon Peter *said to them, “I am going fishing.” They *said to him, “We will also come with you.” They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing."
John,21,4,"But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus."
John,21,5,"So Jesus *said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish, do you?” They answered Him, “No.”"
John,21,6,"And He said to them, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch.” So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish."
John,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into the sea."
John,21,8,"But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fish."
John,21,9,"So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire already laid and fish placed on it, and bread."
John,21,10,"Jesus *said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have now caught.”"
John,21,11,"Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn."
John,21,12,"Jesus *said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples ventured to question Him, “Who are You?” knowing that it was the Lord."
John,21,13,"Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave it to them, and the fish likewise."
John,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead."
John,21,15,"So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?” He *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He *said to him, “Tend My lambs.”"
John,21,16,"He *said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” He *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He *said to him, “Shepherd My sheep.”"
John,21,17,"He *said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.” Jesus *said to him, “Tend My sheep."
John,21,18,"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to go.”"
John,21,19,"Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, “Follow Me!”"
John,21,20,"Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, “Lord, who is the one who betrays You?”"
John,21,21,"So Peter seeing him *said to Jesus, “Lord, and what about this man?”"
John,21,22,"Jesus *said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!”"
John,21,23,"Therefore this saying went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”"
John,21,24,"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true."
John,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books that *would be written."
Acts,1,1,"The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach,"
Acts,1,2,"until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen."
Acts,1,3,"To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God."
Acts,1,4,"Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, “Which,” He said, “you heard of from Me;"
Acts,1,5,"for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”"
Acts,1,6,"So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”"
Acts,1,7,"He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;"
Acts,1,8,"but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.”"
Acts,1,9,"And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight."
Acts,1,10,"And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them."
Acts,1,11,"They also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”"
Acts,1,12,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away."
Acts,1,13,"When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James."
Acts,1,14,"These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers."
Acts,1,15,"At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said,"
Acts,1,16,"“Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus."
Acts,1,17,For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.”
Acts,1,18,"(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out."
Acts,1,19,"And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)"
Acts,1,20,"“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘LET HIS HOMESTEAD BE MADE DESOLATE, AND LET NO ONE DWELL IN IT’; and, ‘LET ANOTHER MAN TAKE HIS OFFICE.’"
Acts,1,21,Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us—
Acts,1,22,beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us—one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.”
Acts,1,23,"So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias."
Acts,1,24,"And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen"
Acts,1,25,to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”
Acts,1,26,"And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles."
Acts,2,1,"When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place."
Acts,2,2,"And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting."
Acts,2,3,"And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them."
Acts,2,4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance."
Acts,2,5,"Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven."
Acts,2,6,"And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language."
Acts,2,7,"They were amazed and astonished, saying, “Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?"
Acts,2,8,And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?
Acts,2,9,"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,"
Acts,2,10,"Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,"
Acts,2,11,Cretans and Arabs—we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.”
Acts,2,12,"And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”"
Acts,2,13,"But others were mocking and saying, “They are full of sweet wine.”"
Acts,2,14,"But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: “Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words."
Acts,2,15,"For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day;"
Acts,2,16,but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel:
Acts,2,17,"‘AND IT SHALL BE IN THE LAST DAYS,’ God says, ‘THAT I WILL POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT ON ALL MANKIND; AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY, AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS;"
Acts,2,18,"EVEN ON MY BONDSLAVES, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, I WILL IN THOSE DAYS POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT And they shall prophesy."
Acts,2,19,"‘AND I WILL GRANT WONDERS IN THE SKY ABOVE AND SIGNS ON THE EARTH BELOW, BLOOD, AND FIRE, AND VAPOR OF SMOKE."
Acts,2,20,"‘THE SUN WILL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS AND THE MOON INTO BLOOD, BEFORE THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAY OF THE LORD SHALL COME."
Acts,2,21,‘AND IT SHALL BE THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.’
Acts,2,22,"“Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—"
Acts,2,23,"this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death."
Acts,2,24,"But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power."
Acts,2,25,"For David says of Him, ‘I SAW THE LORD ALWAYS IN MY PRESENCE; FOR HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND, SO THAT I WILL NOT BE SHAKEN."
Acts,2,26,‘THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE EXULTED; MOREOVER MY FLESH ALSO WILL LIVE IN HOPE;
Acts,2,27,"BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES, NOR ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY."
Acts,2,28,‘YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN TO ME THE WAYS OF LIFE; YOU WILL MAKE ME FULL OF GLADNESS WITH YOUR PRESENCE.’
Acts,2,29,"“Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day."
Acts,2,30,"And so, because he was a prophet and knew that GOD HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE,"
Acts,2,31,"he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NEITHER ABANDONED TO HADES, NOR DID His flesh SUFFER DECAY."
Acts,2,32,"This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses."
Acts,2,33,"Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear."
Acts,2,34,"For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: ‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, “SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,"
Acts,2,35,UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET.”’
Acts,2,36,Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.”
Acts,2,37,"Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brethren, what shall we do?”"
Acts,2,38,"Peter said to them, “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
Acts,2,39,"For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.”"
Acts,2,40,"And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation!”"
Acts,2,41,"So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls."
Acts,2,42,"They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer."
Acts,2,43,Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
Acts,2,44,And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common;
Acts,2,45,"and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need."
Acts,2,46,"Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart,"
Acts,2,47,praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
Acts,3,1,"Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer."
Acts,3,2,"And a man who had been lame from his mother’s womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple."
Acts,3,3,"When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms."
Acts,3,4,"But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, “Look at us!”"
Acts,3,5,"And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them."
Acts,3,6,"But Peter said, “I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk!”"
Acts,3,7,"And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened."
Acts,3,8,"With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God."
Acts,3,9,And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
Acts,3,10,"and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
Acts,3,11,"While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement."
Acts,3,12,"But when Peter saw this, he replied to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?"
Acts,3,13,"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him."
Acts,3,14,"But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,"
Acts,3,15,"but put to death the Prince of life, the one whom God raised from the dead, a fact to which we are witnesses."
Acts,3,16,"And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all."
Acts,3,17,"“And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also."
Acts,3,18,"But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled."
Acts,3,19,"Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;"
Acts,3,20,"and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you,"
Acts,3,21,whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.
Acts,3,22,"Moses said, ‘THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you."
Acts,3,23,And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’
Acts,3,24,"And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and his successors onward, also announced these days."
Acts,3,25,"It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘AND IN YOUR SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED.’"
Acts,3,26,"For you first, God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways.”"
Acts,4,1,"As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,"
Acts,4,2,being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts,4,3,"And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening."
Acts,4,4,But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
Acts,4,5,"On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;"
Acts,4,6,"and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent."
Acts,4,7,"When they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, “By what power, or in what name, have you done this?”"
Acts,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people,"
Acts,4,9,"if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well,"
Acts,4,10,"let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by this name this man stands here before you in good health."
Acts,4,11,"He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone."
Acts,4,12,And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.”
Acts,4,13,"Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed, and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus."
Acts,4,14,"And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply."
Acts,4,15,"But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they began to confer with one another,"
Acts,4,16,"saying, “What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
Acts,4,17,"But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name.”"
Acts,4,18,"And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus."
Acts,4,19,"But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge;"
Acts,4,20,for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
Acts,4,21,"When they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened;"
Acts,4,22,for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
Acts,4,23,"When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them."
Acts,4,24,"And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, “O Lord, it is You who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM,"
Acts,4,25,"who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, ‘WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE, AND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS?"
Acts,4,26,"‘THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.’"
Acts,4,27,"For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,"
Acts,4,28,to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur.
Acts,4,29,"And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence,"
Acts,4,30,"while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.”"
Acts,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness."
Acts,4,32,"And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them."
Acts,4,33,"And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all."
Acts,4,34,"For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales"
Acts,4,35,"and lay them at the apostles’ feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need."
Acts,4,36,"Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement),"
Acts,4,37,"and who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet."
Acts,5,1,"But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,"
Acts,5,2,"and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife’s full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles’ feet."
Acts,5,3,"But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?"
Acts,5,4,"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.”"
Acts,5,5,"And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it."
Acts,5,6,"The young men got up and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him."
Acts,5,7,"Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."
Acts,5,8,"And Peter responded to her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?” And she said, “Yes, that was the price.”"
Acts,5,9,"Then Peter said to her, “Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well.”"
Acts,5,10,"And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband."
Acts,5,11,"And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things."
Acts,5,12,At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s portico.
Acts,5,13,"But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem."
Acts,5,14,"And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number,"
Acts,5,15,"to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them."
Acts,5,16,"Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all being healed."
Acts,5,17,"But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy."
Acts,5,18,They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail.
Acts,5,19,"But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said,"
Acts,5,20,"“Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life.”"
Acts,5,21,"Upon hearing this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought."
Acts,5,22,"But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported back,"
Acts,5,23,"saying, “We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside.”"
Acts,5,24,"Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this."
Acts,5,25,"But someone came and reported to them, “The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”"
Acts,5,26,"Then the captain went along with the officers and proceeded to bring them back without violence (for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned)."
Acts,5,27,"When they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. The high priest questioned them,"
Acts,5,28,"saying, “We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.”"
Acts,5,29,"But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men."
Acts,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross."
Acts,5,31,"He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
Acts,5,32,"And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.”"
Acts,5,33,"But when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and intended to kill them."
Acts,5,34,"But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time."
Acts,5,35,"And he said to them, “Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men."
Acts,5,36,"For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing."
Acts,5,37,"After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered."
Acts,5,38,"So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will be overthrown;"
Acts,5,39,"but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.”"
Acts,5,40,"They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then released them."
Acts,5,41,"So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name."
Acts,5,42,"And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ."
Acts,6,1,"Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving of food."
Acts,6,2,"So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, “It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables."
Acts,6,3,"Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task."
Acts,6,4,But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
Acts,6,5,"The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch."
Acts,6,6,"And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them."
Acts,6,7,"The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith."
Acts,6,8,"And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people."
Acts,6,9,"But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen."
Acts,6,10,But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
Acts,6,11,"Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”"
Acts,6,12,"And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council."
Acts,6,13,"They put forward false witnesses who said, “This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law;"
Acts,6,14,"for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us.”"
Acts,6,15,"And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel."
Acts,7,1,"The high priest said, “Are these things so?”"
Acts,7,2,"And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,"
Acts,7,3,"and said to him, ‘LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR RELATIVES, AND COME INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU.’"
Acts,7,4,"Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living."
Acts,7,5,"But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even when he had no child, He promised that HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AS A POSSESSION, AND TO HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM."
Acts,7,6,"But God spoke to this effect, that his DESCENDANTS WOULD BE ALIENS IN A FOREIGN LAND, AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ENSLAVED AND MISTREATED FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS."
Acts,7,7,"‘AND WHATEVER NATION TO WHICH THEY WILL BE IN BONDAGE I MYSELF WILL JUDGE,’ said God, ‘AND AFTER THAT THEY WILL COME OUT AND SERVE ME IN THIS PLACE.’"
Acts,7,8,"And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs."
Acts,7,9,"“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him,"
Acts,7,10,"and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household."
Acts,7,11,"“Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction with it, and our fathers could find no food."
Acts,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time."
Acts,7,13,"On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family was disclosed to Pharaoh."
Acts,7,14,"Then Joseph sent word and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five persons in all."
Acts,7,15,And Jacob went down to Egypt and there he and our fathers died.
Acts,7,16,From there they were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts,7,17,"“But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,"
Acts,7,18,until THERE AROSE ANOTHER KING OVER EGYPT WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT JOSEPH.
Acts,7,19,It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive.
Acts,7,20,"It was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and he was nurtured three months in his father’s home."
Acts,7,21,"And after he had been set outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son."
Acts,7,22,"Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds."
Acts,7,23,"But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel."
Acts,7,24,"And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian."
Acts,7,25,"And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand."
Acts,7,26,"On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, ‘Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?’"
Acts,7,27,"But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, ‘WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND JUDGE OVER US?"
Acts,7,28,"YOU DO NOT MEAN TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN YESTERDAY, DO YOU?’"
Acts,7,29,"At this remark, MOSES FLED AND BECAME AN ALIEN IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN, where he became the father of two sons."
Acts,7,30,"“After forty years had passed, AN ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM IN THE WILDERNESS OF MOUNT Sinai, IN THE FLAME OF A BURNING THORN BUSH."
Acts,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, there came the voice of the Lord:"
Acts,7,32,"‘I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB.’ Moses shook with fear and would not venture to look."
Acts,7,33,"BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM, ‘TAKE OFF THE SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET, FOR THE PLACE ON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND."
Acts,7,34,"I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THE OPPRESSION OF MY PEOPLE IN EGYPT AND HAVE HEARD THEIR GROANS, AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO RESCUE THEM; COME NOW, AND I WILL SEND YOU TO EGYPT.’"
Acts,7,35,"“This Moses whom they disowned, saying, ‘WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE?’ is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush."
Acts,7,36,"This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years."
Acts,7,37,"This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, ‘GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN.’"
Acts,7,38,"This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and who was with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to you."
Acts,7,39,"Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him, but repudiated him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,"
Acts,7,40,"SAYING TO AARON, ‘MAKE FOR US GODS WHO WILL GO BEFORE US; FOR THIS MOSES WHO LED US OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT—WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.’"
Acts,7,41,"At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands."
Acts,7,42,"But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, ‘IT WAS NOT TO ME THAT YOU OFFERED VICTIMS AND SACRIFICES FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS, WAS IT, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL?"
Acts,7,43,"YOU ALSO TOOK ALONG THE TABERNACLE OF MOLOCH AND THE STAR OF THE GOD ROMPHA, THE IMAGES WHICH YOU MADE TO WORSHIP. I ALSO WILL REMOVE YOU BEYOND BABYLON.’"
Acts,7,44,"“Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen."
Acts,7,45,"And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations whom God drove out before our fathers, until the time of David."
Acts,7,46,"David found favor in God’s sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob."
Acts,7,47,But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.
Acts,7,48,"However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:"
Acts,7,49,"‘HEAVEN IS MY THRONE, AND EARTH IS THE FOOTSTOOL OF MY FEET; WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD FOR ME?’ says the Lord, ‘OR WHAT PLACE IS THERE FOR MY REPOSE?"
Acts,7,50,‘WAS IT NOT MY HAND WHICH MADE ALL THESE THINGS?’
Acts,7,51,“You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did.
Acts,7,52,"Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become;"
Acts,7,53,"you who received the law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it.”"
Acts,7,54,"Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him."
Acts,7,55,"But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;"
Acts,7,56,"and he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”"
Acts,7,57,"But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse."
Acts,7,58,"When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him; and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul."
Acts,7,59,"They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”"
Acts,7,60,"Then falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” Having said this, he fell asleep."
Acts,8,1,"Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles."
Acts,8,2,"Some devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him."
Acts,8,3,"But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison."
Acts,8,4,"Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word."
Acts,8,5,Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them.
Acts,8,6,"The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing."
Acts,8,7,"For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed."
Acts,8,8,So there was much rejoicing in that city.
Acts,8,9,"Now there was a man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great;"
Acts,8,10,"and they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, “This man is what is called the Great Power of God.”"
Acts,8,11,And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts.
Acts,8,12,"But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike."
Acts,8,13,"Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed."
Acts,8,14,"Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,"
Acts,8,15,who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
Acts,8,16,For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts,8,17,"Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit."
Acts,8,18,"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,"
Acts,8,19,"saying, “Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”"
Acts,8,20,"But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!"
Acts,8,21,"You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God."
Acts,8,22,"Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you."
Acts,8,23,For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.”
Acts,8,24,"But Simon answered and said, “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”"
Acts,8,25,"So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans."
Acts,8,26,"But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, “Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)"
Acts,8,27,"So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,"
Acts,8,28,"and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah."
Acts,8,29,"Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go up and join this chariot.”"
Acts,8,30,"Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”"
Acts,8,31,"And he said, “Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."
Acts,8,32,"Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: “HE WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER; AND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT, SO HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH."
Acts,8,33,“IN HUMILIATION HIS JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY; WHO WILL RELATE HIS GENERATION? FOR HIS LIFE IS REMOVED FROM THE EARTH.”
Acts,8,34,"The eunuch answered Philip and said, “Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?”"
Acts,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him."
Acts,8,36,"As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?”"
Acts,8,37,"[And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”]"
Acts,8,38,"And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him."
Acts,8,39,"When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing."
Acts,8,40,"But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea."
Acts,9,1,"Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,"
Acts,9,2,"and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
Acts,9,3,"As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him;"
Acts,9,4,"and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?”"
Acts,9,5,"And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” And He said, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,"
Acts,9,6,"but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.”"
Acts,9,7,"The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one."
Acts,9,8,"Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus."
Acts,9,9,"And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank."
Acts,9,10,"Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.”"
Acts,9,11,"And the Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,"
Acts,9,12,"and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight.”"
Acts,9,13,"But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem;"
Acts,9,14,and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.”
Acts,9,15,"But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;"
Acts,9,16,for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name’s sake.”
Acts,9,17,"So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”"
Acts,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized;"
Acts,9,19,"Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus,"
Acts,9,20,"and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “He is the Son of God.”"
Acts,9,21,"All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, “Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?”"
Acts,9,22,But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.
Acts,9,23,"When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him,"
Acts,9,24,but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death;
Acts,9,25,"but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket."
Acts,9,26,"When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple."
Acts,9,27,"But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus."
Acts,9,28,"And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord."
Acts,9,29,And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were attempting to put him to death.
Acts,9,30,"But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus."
Acts,9,31,"So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase."
Acts,9,32,"Now as Peter was traveling through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda."
Acts,9,33,"There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed."
Acts,9,34,"Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.” Immediately he got up."
Acts,9,35,"And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord."
Acts,9,36,Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did.
Acts,9,37,"And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room."
Acts,9,38,"Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, “Do not delay in coming to us.”"
Acts,9,39,"So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them."
Acts,9,40,"But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, arise.” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
Acts,9,41,"And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive."
Acts,9,42,"It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord."
Acts,9,43,And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.
Acts,10,1,"Now there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,"
Acts,10,2,"a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually."
Acts,10,3,"About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, “Cornelius!”"
Acts,10,4,"And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God."
Acts,10,5,"Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon, who is also called Peter;"
Acts,10,6,"he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.”"
Acts,10,7,"When the angel who was speaking to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,"
Acts,10,8,"and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa."
Acts,10,9,"On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray."
Acts,10,10,"But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance;"
Acts,10,11,"and he *saw the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground,"
Acts,10,12,and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air.
Acts,10,13,"A voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, kill and eat!”"
Acts,10,14,"But Peter said, “By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean.”"
Acts,10,15,"Again a voice came to him a second time, “What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.”"
Acts,10,16,"This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky."
Acts,10,17,"Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon’s house, appeared at the gate;"
Acts,10,18,"and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there."
Acts,10,19,"While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you."
Acts,10,20,"But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself.”"
Acts,10,21,"Peter went down to the men and said, “Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?”"
Acts,10,22,"They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was divinely directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear a message from you.”"
Acts,10,23,"And on the next day he got up and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
Acts,10,24,On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
Acts,10,25,"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him."
Acts,10,26,"But Peter raised him up, saying, “Stand up; I too am just a man.”"
Acts,10,27,"As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled."
Acts,10,28,"And he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean."
Acts,10,29,That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me.”
Acts,10,30,"Cornelius said, “Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,"
Acts,10,31,"and he *said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God."
Acts,10,32,"Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.’"
Acts,10,33,"So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.”"
Acts,10,34,"Opening his mouth, Peter said: “I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,"
Acts,10,35,but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him.
Acts,10,36,"The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)—"
Acts,10,37,"you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed."
Acts,10,38,"You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him."
Acts,10,39,We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.
Acts,10,40,"God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible,"
Acts,10,41,"not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead."
Acts,10,42,"And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead."
Acts,10,43,Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.”
Acts,10,44,"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message."
Acts,10,45,"All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also."
Acts,10,46,"For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,"
Acts,10,47,"“Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?”"
Acts,10,48,And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.
Acts,11,1,Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts,11,2,"And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him,"
Acts,11,3,"saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.”"
Acts,11,4,"But Peter began speaking and proceeded to explain to them in orderly sequence, saying,"
Acts,11,5,"“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me,"
Acts,11,6,and when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air.
Acts,11,7,"I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’"
Acts,11,8,"But I said, ‘By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’"
Acts,11,9,"But a voice from heaven answered a second time, ‘What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.’"
Acts,11,10,"This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky."
Acts,11,11,"And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea."
Acts,11,12,The Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. These six brethren also went with me and we entered the man’s house.
Acts,11,13,"And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;"
Acts,11,14,"and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’"
Acts,11,15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning."
Acts,11,16,"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’"
Acts,11,17,"Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God’s way?”"
Acts,11,18,"When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, “Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life.”"
Acts,11,19,"So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone."
Acts,11,20,"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus."
Acts,11,21,"And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord."
Acts,11,22,"The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch."
Acts,11,23,"Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord;"
Acts,11,24,"for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord."
Acts,11,25,And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;
Acts,11,26,"and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch."
Acts,11,27,Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts,11,28,One of them named Agabus stood up and began to indicate by the Spirit that there would certainly be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius.
Acts,11,29,"And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brethren living in Judea."
Acts,11,30,"And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders."
Acts,12,1,Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them.
Acts,12,2,And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword.
Acts,12,3,"When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread."
Acts,12,4,"When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people."
Acts,12,5,"So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God."
Acts,12,6,"On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison."
Acts,12,7,"And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter’s side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly.” And his chains fell off his hands."
Acts,12,8,"And the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and put on your sandals.” And he did so. And he *said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”"
Acts,12,9,"And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision."
Acts,12,10,"When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him."
Acts,12,11,"When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”"
Acts,12,12,"And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying."
Acts,12,13,"When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer."
Acts,12,14,"When she recognized Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate."
Acts,12,15,"They said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, “It is his angel.”"
Acts,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the door, they saw him and were amazed."
Acts,12,17,"But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, “Report these things to James and the brethren.” Then he left and went to another place."
Acts,12,18,"Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter."
Acts,12,19,"When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there."
Acts,12,20,"Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one accord they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king’s chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was fed by the king’s country."
Acts,12,21,"On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them."
Acts,12,22,"The people kept crying out, “The voice of a god and not of a man!”"
Acts,12,23,"And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died."
Acts,12,24,But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.
Acts,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark."
Acts,13,1,"Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
Acts,13,2,"While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”"
Acts,13,3,"Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."
Acts,13,4,"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
Acts,13,5,"When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper."
Acts,13,6,"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,"
Acts,13,7,"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God."
Acts,13,8,"But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith."
Acts,13,9,"But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him,"
Acts,13,10,"and said, “You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?"
Acts,13,11,"Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand."
Acts,13,12,"Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord."
Acts,13,13,Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts,13,14,"But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down."
Acts,13,15,"After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, “Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.”"
Acts,13,16,"Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, “Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:"
Acts,13,17,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it."
Acts,13,18,For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.
Acts,13,19,"When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance—all of which took about four hundred and fifty years."
Acts,13,20,After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts,13,21,"Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
Acts,13,22,"After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ‘I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.’"
Acts,13,23,"From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,"
Acts,13,24,after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts,13,25,"And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold, one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’"
Acts,13,26,"“Brethren, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent."
Acts,13,27,"For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning Him."
Acts,13,28,"And though they found no ground for putting Him to death, they asked Pilate that He be executed."
Acts,13,29,"When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb."
Acts,13,30,But God raised Him from the dead;
Acts,13,31,"and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people."
Acts,13,32,"And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,"
Acts,13,33,"that God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, ‘YOU ARE MY SON; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU.’"
Acts,13,34,"As for the fact that He raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: ‘I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY and SURE blessings OF DAVID.’"
Acts,13,35,"Therefore He also says in another Psalm, ‘YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.’"
Acts,13,36,"For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay;"
Acts,13,37,but He whom God raised did not undergo decay.
Acts,13,38,"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,"
Acts,13,39,"and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses."
Acts,13,40,"Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon you:"
Acts,13,41,"‘BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.’”"
Acts,13,42,"As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath."
Acts,13,43,"Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God."
Acts,13,44,The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.
Acts,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming."
Acts,13,46,"Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles."
Acts,13,47,"For so the Lord has commanded us, ‘I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.’”"
Acts,13,48,"When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed."
Acts,13,49,And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.
Acts,13,50,"But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district."
Acts,13,51,But they shook off the dust of their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
Acts,13,52,And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
Acts,14,1,"In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks."
Acts,14,2,But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren.
Acts,14,3,"Therefore they spent a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands."
Acts,14,4,"But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles."
Acts,14,5,"And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them,"
Acts,14,6,"they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;"
Acts,14,7,and there they continued to preach the gospel.
Acts,14,8,"At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother’s womb, who had never walked."
Acts,14,9,"This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well,"
Acts,14,10,"said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he leaped up and began to walk."
Acts,14,11,"When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us.”"
Acts,14,12,"And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker."
Acts,14,13,"The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds."
Acts,14,14,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out"
Acts,14,15,"and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM."
Acts,14,16,In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;
Acts,14,17,"and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”"
Acts,14,18,"Even saying these things, with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them."
Acts,14,19,"But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead."
Acts,14,20,"But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe."
Acts,14,21,"After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,"
Acts,14,22,"strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, “Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.”"
Acts,14,23,"When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
Acts,14,24,They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.
Acts,14,25,"When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia."
Acts,14,26,"From there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished."
Acts,14,27,"When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they began to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles."
Acts,14,28,And they spent a long time with the disciples.
Acts,15,1,"Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”"
Acts,15,2,"And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue."
Acts,15,3,"Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren."
Acts,15,4,"When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them."
Acts,15,5,"But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.”"
Acts,15,6,The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.
Acts,15,7,"After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe."
Acts,15,8,"And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;"
Acts,15,9,"and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith."
Acts,15,10,Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
Acts,15,11,"But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.”"
Acts,15,12,"All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles."
Acts,15,13,"After they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Brethren, listen to me."
Acts,15,14,Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.
Acts,15,15,"With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,"
Acts,15,16,"‘AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT,"
Acts,15,17,"SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,’"
Acts,15,18,"SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO."
Acts,15,19,"Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,"
Acts,15,20,but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.
Acts,15,21,"For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”"
Acts,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,"
Acts,15,23,"and they sent this letter by them, “The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings."
Acts,15,24,"“Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with their words, unsettling your souls,"
Acts,15,25,"it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
Acts,15,26,men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts,15,27,"“Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth."
Acts,15,28,“For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:
Acts,15,29,"that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.”"
Acts,15,30,"So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter."
Acts,15,31,"When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement."
Acts,15,32,"Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message."
Acts,15,33,"After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out."
Acts,15,34,[But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]
Acts,15,35,"But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord."
Acts,15,36,"After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”"
Acts,15,37,"Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also."
Acts,15,38,But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
Acts,15,39,"And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus."
Acts,15,40,"But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord."
Acts,15,41,"And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
Acts,16,1,"Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,"
Acts,16,2,and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.
Acts,16,3,"Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek."
Acts,16,4,"Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe."
Acts,16,5,"So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily."
Acts,16,6,"They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;"
Acts,16,7,"and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;"
Acts,16,8,"and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas."
Acts,16,9,"A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”"
Acts,16,10,"When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them."
Acts,16,11,"So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;"
Acts,16,12,"and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we were staying in this city for some days."
Acts,16,13,"And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled."
Acts,16,14,"A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul."
Acts,16,15,"And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us."
Acts,16,16,"It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling."
Acts,16,17,"Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, “These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.”"
Acts,16,18,"She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out at that very moment."
Acts,16,19,"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities,"
Acts,16,20,"and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, “These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,"
Acts,16,21,"and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.”"
Acts,16,22,"The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods."
Acts,16,23,"When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;"
Acts,16,24,"and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks."
Acts,16,25,"But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;"
Acts,16,26,"and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were unfastened."
Acts,16,27,"When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped."
Acts,16,28,"But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!”"
Acts,16,29,"And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,"
Acts,16,30,"and after he brought them out, he said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”"
Acts,16,31,"They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”"
Acts,16,32,And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.
Acts,16,33,"And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household."
Acts,16,34,"And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household."
Acts,16,35,"Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, “Release those men.”"
Acts,16,36,"And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace.”"
Acts,16,37,"But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out.”"
Acts,16,38,"The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,"
Acts,16,39,"and they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city."
Acts,16,40,"They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed."
Acts,17,1,"Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews."
Acts,17,2,"And according to Paul’s custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,"
Acts,17,3,"explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.”"
Acts,17,4,"And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women."
Acts,17,5,"But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people."
Acts,17,6,"When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have upset the world have come here also;"
Acts,17,7,"and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.”"
Acts,17,8,They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.
Acts,17,9,"And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them."
Acts,17,10,"The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews."
Acts,17,11,"Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."
Acts,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men."
Acts,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds."
Acts,17,14,Then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.
Acts,17,15,"Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left."
Acts,17,16,"Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols."
Acts,17,17,"So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present."
Acts,17,18,"And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, “What would this idle babbler wish to say?” Others, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection."
Acts,17,19,"And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming?"
Acts,17,20,For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.”
Acts,17,21,(Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
Acts,17,22,"So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects."
Acts,17,23,"For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you."
Acts,17,24,"The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;"
Acts,17,25,"nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;"
Acts,17,26,"and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,"
Acts,17,27,"that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;"
Acts,17,28,"for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children.’"
Acts,17,29,"Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man."
Acts,17,30,"Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent,"
Acts,17,31,"because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.”"
Acts,17,32,"Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, “We shall hear you again concerning this.”"
Acts,17,33,So Paul went out of their midst.
Acts,17,34,"But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them."
Acts,18,1,After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.
Acts,18,2,"And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,"
Acts,18,3,"and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers."
Acts,18,4,And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
Acts,18,5,"But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."
Acts,18,6,"But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”"
Acts,18,7,"Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue."
Acts,18,8,"Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized."
Acts,18,9,"And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, “Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent;"
Acts,18,10,"for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”"
Acts,18,11,"And he settled there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
Acts,18,12,"But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,"
Acts,18,13,"saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”"
Acts,18,14,"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;"
Acts,18,15,"but if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters.”"
Acts,18,16,And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
Acts,18,17,"And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things."
Acts,18,18,"Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow."
Acts,18,19,"They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews."
Acts,18,20,"When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent,"
Acts,18,21,"but taking leave of them and saying, “I will return to you again if God wills,” he set sail from Ephesus."
Acts,18,22,"When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch."
Acts,18,23,"And having spent some time there, he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples."
Acts,18,24,"Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures."
Acts,18,25,"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;"
Acts,18,26,"and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately."
Acts,18,27,"And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,"
Acts,18,28,"for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ."
Acts,19,1,"It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples."
Acts,19,2,"He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.”"
Acts,19,3,"And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into John’s baptism.”"
Acts,19,4,"Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”"
Acts,19,5,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts,19,6,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying."
Acts,19,7,There were in all about twelve men.
Acts,19,8,"And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God."
Acts,19,9,"But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus."
Acts,19,10,"This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks."
Acts,19,11,"God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,"
Acts,19,12,"so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out."
Acts,19,13,"But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, “I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.”"
Acts,19,14,"Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this."
Acts,19,15,"And the evil spirit answered and said to them, “I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?”"
Acts,19,16,"And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
Acts,19,17,"This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified."
Acts,19,18,"Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices."
Acts,19,19,And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of everyone; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts,19,20,So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
Acts,19,21,"Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”"
Acts,19,22,"And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while."
Acts,19,23,About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way.
Acts,19,24,"For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen;"
Acts,19,25,"these he gathered together with the workmen of similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business."
Acts,19,26,"You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all."
Acts,19,27,"Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.”"
Acts,19,28,"When they heard this and were filled with rage, they began crying out, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”"
Acts,19,29,"The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia."
Acts,19,30,"And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him."
Acts,19,31,Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater.
Acts,19,32,"So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together."
Acts,19,33,"Some of the crowd concluded it was Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly."
Acts,19,34,"But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”"
Acts,19,35,"After quieting the crowd, the town clerk *said, “Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?"
Acts,19,36,"So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash."
Acts,19,37,For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts,19,38,"So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are available; let them bring charges against one another."
Acts,19,39,"But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly."
Acts,19,40,"For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today’s events, since there is no real cause for it, and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering.”"
Acts,19,41,After saying this he dismissed the assembly.
Acts,20,1,"After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia."
Acts,20,2,"When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece."
Acts,20,3,"And there he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia."
Acts,20,4,"And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia."
Acts,20,5,But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts,20,6,"We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days."
Acts,20,7,"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight."
Acts,20,8,There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
Acts,20,9,"And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead."
Acts,20,10,"But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, “Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.”"
Acts,20,11,"When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left."
Acts,20,12,"They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted."
Acts,20,13,"But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for so he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land."
Acts,20,14,"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene."
Acts,20,15,"Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus."
Acts,20,16,"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost."
Acts,20,17,From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.
Acts,20,18,"And when they had come to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,"
Acts,20,19,serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
Acts,20,20,"how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,"
Acts,20,21,solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts,20,22,"And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,"
Acts,20,23,"except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me."
Acts,20,24,"But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God."
Acts,20,25,"“And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face."
Acts,20,26,"Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men."
Acts,20,27,For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.
Acts,20,28,"Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood."
Acts,20,29,"I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;"
Acts,20,30,"and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them."
Acts,20,31,"Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears."
Acts,20,32,"And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified."
Acts,20,33,I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothes.
Acts,20,34,You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me.
Acts,20,35,"In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”"
Acts,20,36,"When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all."
Acts,20,37,"And they began to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,"
Acts,20,38,"grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship."
Acts,21,1,"When we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara;"
Acts,21,2,"and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail."
Acts,21,3,"When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo."
Acts,21,4,"After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem."
Acts,21,5,"When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another."
Acts,21,6,"Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again."
Acts,21,7,"When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day."
Acts,21,8,"On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him."
Acts,21,9,Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.
Acts,21,10,"As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea."
Acts,21,11,"And coming to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”"
Acts,21,12,"When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem."
Acts,21,13,"Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”"
Acts,21,14,"And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, “The will of the Lord be done!”"
Acts,21,15,After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem.
Acts,21,16,"Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge."
Acts,21,17,"After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
Acts,21,18,"And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present."
Acts,21,19,"After he had greeted them, he began to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry."
Acts,21,20,"And when they heard it they began glorifying God; and they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law;"
Acts,21,21,"and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs."
Acts,21,22,"What, then, is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come."
Acts,21,23,Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;
Acts,21,24,"take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law."
Acts,21,25,"But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.”"
Acts,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them."
Acts,21,27,"When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, began to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him,"
Acts,21,28,"crying out, “Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”"
Acts,21,29,"For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple."
Acts,21,30,"Then all the city was provoked, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut."
Acts,21,31,"While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion."
Acts,21,32,"At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
Acts,21,33,"Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he began asking who he was and what he had done."
Acts,21,34,"But among the crowd some were shouting one thing and some another, and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks."
Acts,21,35,"When he got to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;"
Acts,21,36,"for the multitude of the people kept following them, shouting, “Away with him!”"
Acts,21,37,"As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, “May I say something to you?” And he *said, “Do you know Greek?"
Acts,21,38,Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?”
Acts,21,39,"But Paul said, “I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”"
Acts,21,40,"When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,"
Acts,22,1,"“Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.”"
Acts,22,2,"And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said,"
Acts,22,3,"“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today."
Acts,22,4,"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,"
Acts,22,5,"as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished."
Acts,22,6,"“But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,"
Acts,22,7,"and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?’"
Acts,22,8,"And I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’"
Acts,22,9,"And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me."
Acts,22,10,"And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.’"
Acts,22,11,"But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus."
Acts,22,12,"“A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,"
Acts,22,13,"came to me, and standing near said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very time I looked up at him."
Acts,22,14,"And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth."
Acts,22,15,For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
Acts,22,16,"Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.’"
Acts,22,17,"“It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,"
Acts,22,18,"and I saw Him saying to me, ‘Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.’"
Acts,22,19,"And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You."
Acts,22,20,"And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.’"
Acts,22,21,"And He said to me, ‘Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”"
Acts,22,22,"They listened to him up to this statement, and then they raised their voices and said, “Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!”"
Acts,22,23,"And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,"
Acts,22,24,"the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way."
Acts,22,25,"But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?”"
Acts,22,26,"When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.”"
Acts,22,27,"The commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.”"
Acts,22,28,"The commander answered, “I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I was actually born a citizen.”"
Acts,22,29,"Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains."
Acts,22,30,"But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them."
Acts,23,1,"Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, “Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day.”"
Acts,23,2,The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
Acts,23,3,"Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?”"
Acts,23,4,"But the bystanders said, “Do you revile God’s high priest?”"
Acts,23,5,"And Paul said, “I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, ‘YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE.’”"
Acts,23,6,"But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul began crying out in the Council, “Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!”"
Acts,23,7,"As he said this, there occurred a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided."
Acts,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all."
Acts,23,9,"And there occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”"
Acts,23,10,"And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks."
Acts,23,11,"But on the night immediately following, the Lord stood at his side and said, “Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also.”"
Acts,23,12,"When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul."
Acts,23,13,There were more than forty who formed this plot.
Acts,23,14,"They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul."
Acts,23,15,"Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near the place.”"
Acts,23,16,"But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul."
Acts,23,17,"Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, “Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.”"
Acts,23,18,"So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, “Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you.”"
Acts,23,19,"The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, began to inquire of him privately, “What is it that you have to report to me?”"
Acts,23,20,"And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him."
Acts,23,21,"So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you.”"
Acts,23,22,"So the commander let the young man go, instructing him, “Tell no one that you have notified me of these things.”"
Acts,23,23,"And he called to him two of the centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen.”"
Acts,23,24,They were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
Acts,23,25,And he wrote a letter having this form:
Acts,23,26,"“Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings."
Acts,23,27,"“When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman."
Acts,23,28,"“And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council;"
Acts,23,29,"and I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment."
Acts,23,30,"“When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.”"
Acts,23,31,"So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris."
Acts,23,32,"But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks."
Acts,23,33,"When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him."
Acts,23,34,"When he had read it, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,"
Acts,23,35,"he said, “I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also,” giving orders for him to be kept in Herod’s Praetorium."
Acts,24,1,"After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought charges to the governor against Paul."
Acts,24,2,"After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to the governor, “Since we have through you attained much peace, and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation,"
Acts,24,3,"we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness."
Acts,24,4,"But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing."
Acts,24,5,"For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."
Acts,24,6,And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. [We wanted to judge him according to our own Law.
Acts,24,7,"But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands,"
Acts,24,8,ordering his accusers to come before you.] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him.”
Acts,24,9,"The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so."
Acts,24,10,"When the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded: “Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,"
Acts,24,11,since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
Acts,24,12,"Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city itself did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot."
Acts,24,13,Nor can they prove to you the charges of which they now accuse me.
Acts,24,14,"But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets;"
Acts,24,15,"having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked."
Acts,24,16,"In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men."
Acts,24,17,Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings;
Acts,24,18,"in which they found me occupied in the temple, having been purified, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia—"
Acts,24,19,"who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me."
Acts,24,20,"Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council,"
Acts,24,21,"other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, ‘For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.’”"
Acts,24,22,"But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.”"
Acts,24,23,"Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him."
Acts,24,24,"But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus."
Acts,24,25,"But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.”"
Acts,24,26,"At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him."
Acts,24,27,"But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned."
Acts,25,1,"Festus then, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea."
Acts,25,2,"And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were urging him,"
Acts,25,3,"requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (at the same time, setting an ambush to kill him on the way)."
Acts,25,4,Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly.
Acts,25,5,"“Therefore,” he *said, “let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him.”"
Acts,25,6,"After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought."
Acts,25,7,"After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove,"
Acts,25,8,"while Paul said in his own defense, “I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar.”"
Acts,25,9,"But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these charges?”"
Acts,25,10,"But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know."
Acts,25,11,"If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”"
Acts,25,12,"Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, “You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.”"
Acts,25,13,"Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus."
Acts,25,14,"While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;"
Acts,25,15,"and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him."
Acts,25,16,I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.
Acts,25,17,"So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought before me."
Acts,25,18,"When the accusers stood up, they began bringing charges against him not of such crimes as I was expecting,"
Acts,25,19,"but they simply had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive."
Acts,25,20,"Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters."
Acts,25,21,"But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar.”"
Acts,25,22,"Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I also would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he *said, “you shall hear him.”"
Acts,25,23,"So, on the next day when Agrippa came together with Bernice amid great pomp, and entered the auditorium accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in."
Acts,25,24,"Festus *said, “King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer."
Acts,25,25,"But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him."
Acts,25,26,"Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write."
Acts,25,27,"For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him.”"
Acts,26,1,"Agrippa said to Paul, “You are permitted to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to make his defense:"
Acts,26,2,"“In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today;"
Acts,26,3,especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
Acts,26,4,"“So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem;"
Acts,26,5,"since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion."
Acts,26,6,And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
Acts,26,7,"the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews."
Acts,26,8,Why is it considered incredible among you people if God does raise the dead?
Acts,26,9,"“So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
Acts,26,10,"And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them."
Acts,26,11,"And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities."
Acts,26,12,"“While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,"
Acts,26,13,"at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me."
Acts,26,14,"And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’"
Acts,26,15,"And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting."
Acts,26,16,"But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you;"
Acts,26,17,"rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,"
Acts,26,18,"to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.’"
Acts,26,19,"“So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,"
Acts,26,20,"but kept declaring both to those of Damascus first, and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds appropriate to repentance."
Acts,26,21,For this reason some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death.
Acts,26,22,"So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place;"
Acts,26,23,"that the Christ was to suffer, and that by reason of His resurrection from the dead He would be the first to proclaim light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.”"
Acts,26,24,"While Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.”"
Acts,26,25,"But Paul *said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth."
Acts,26,26,"For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner."
Acts,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do.”"
Acts,26,28,"Agrippa replied to Paul, “In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian.”"
Acts,26,29,"And Paul said, “I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”"
Acts,26,30,"The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,"
Acts,26,31,"and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, “This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment.”"
Acts,26,32,"And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”"
Acts,27,1,"When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius."
Acts,27,2,"And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica."
Acts,27,3,The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.
Acts,27,4,From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.
Acts,27,5,"When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia."
Acts,27,6,"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it."
Acts,27,7,"When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;"
Acts,27,8,"and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea."
Acts,27,9,"When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul began to admonish them,"
Acts,27,10,"and said to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”"
Acts,27,11,But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.
Acts,27,12,"Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there."
Acts,27,13,"When a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore."
Acts,27,14,"But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called Euraquilo;"
Acts,27,15,"and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and let ourselves be driven along."
Acts,27,16,"Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the ship’s boat under control."
Acts,27,17,"After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along."
Acts,27,18,"The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;"
Acts,27,19,and on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.
Acts,27,20,"Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned."
Acts,27,21,"When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, “Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss."
Acts,27,22,"Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship."
Acts,27,23,"For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,"
Acts,27,24,"saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.’"
Acts,27,25,"Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told."
Acts,27,26,But we must run aground on a certain island.”
Acts,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to surmise that they were approaching some land."
Acts,27,28,They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms.
Acts,27,29,"Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak."
Acts,27,30,"But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the ship’s boat into the sea, on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,"
Acts,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.”"
Acts,27,32,Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it fall away.
Acts,27,33,"Until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing."
Acts,27,34,"Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.”"
Acts,27,35,"Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat."
Acts,27,36,All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food.
Acts,27,37,All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.
Acts,27,38,"When they had eaten enough, they began to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea."
Acts,27,39,"When day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could."
Acts,27,40,"And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach."
Acts,27,41,"But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the force of the waves."
Acts,27,42,"The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape;"
Acts,27,43,"but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,"
Acts,27,44,"and the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land."
Acts,28,1,"When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta."
Acts,28,2,"The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all."
Acts,28,3,"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand."
Acts,28,4,"When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, “Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”"
Acts,28,5,However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
Acts,28,6,"But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god."
Acts,28,7,"Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days."
Acts,28,8,"And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him."
Acts,28,9,"After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured."
Acts,28,10,"They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all we needed."
Acts,28,11,"At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead."
Acts,28,12,"After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days."
Acts,28,13,"From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli."
Acts,28,14,"There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome."
Acts,28,15,"And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage."
Acts,28,16,"When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him."
Acts,28,17,"After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he began saying to them, “Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
Acts,28,18,"And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death."
Acts,28,19,"But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation."
Acts,28,20,"For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel.”"
Acts,28,21,"They said to him, “We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you."
Acts,28,22,"But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”"
Acts,28,23,"When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening."
Acts,28,24,"Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe."
Acts,28,25,"And when they did not agree with one another, they began leaving after Paul had spoken one parting word, “The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,"
Acts,28,26,"saying, ‘GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY, “YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; AND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;"
Acts,28,27,"FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES; OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.”’"
Acts,28,28,Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen.”
Acts,28,29,"[When he had spoken these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]"
Acts,28,30,"And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters and was welcoming all who came to him,"
Acts,28,31,"preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered."
Romans,1,1,"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,"
Romans,1,2,"which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,"
Romans,1,3,"concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh,"
Romans,1,4,"who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,"
Romans,1,5,"through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name’s sake,"
Romans,1,6,among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
Romans,1,7,"to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Romans,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world."
Romans,1,9,"For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you,"
Romans,1,10,"always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you."
Romans,1,11,"For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established;"
Romans,1,12,"that is, that I may be encouraged together with you while among you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine."
Romans,1,13,"I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles."
Romans,1,14,"I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish."
Romans,1,15,"So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome."
Romans,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
Romans,1,17,"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.”"
Romans,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,"
Romans,1,19,because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.
Romans,1,20,"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse."
Romans,1,21,"For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
Romans,1,22,"Professing to be wise, they became fools,"
Romans,1,23,and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
Romans,1,24,"Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them."
Romans,1,25,"For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
Romans,1,26,"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,"
Romans,1,27,"and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error."
Romans,1,28,"And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,"
Romans,1,29,"being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,"
Romans,1,30,"slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,"
Romans,1,31,"without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;"
Romans,1,32,"and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them."
Romans,2,1,"Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things."
Romans,2,2,And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.
Romans,2,3,"But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?"
Romans,2,4,"Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"
Romans,2,5,"But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,"
Romans,2,6,who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS:
Romans,2,7,"to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;"
Romans,2,8,"but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation."
Romans,2,9,"There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,"
Romans,2,10,"but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
Romans,2,11,For there is no partiality with God.
Romans,2,12,"For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;"
Romans,2,13,"for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified."
Romans,2,14,"For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,"
Romans,2,15,"in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,"
Romans,2,16,"on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus."
Romans,2,17,"But if you bear the name “Jew” and rely upon the Law and boast in God,"
Romans,2,18,"and know His will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law,"
Romans,2,19,"and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,"
Romans,2,20,"a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,"
Romans,2,21,"you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?"
Romans,2,22,"You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?"
Romans,2,23,"You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God?"
Romans,2,24,"For “THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU,” just as it is written."
Romans,2,25,"For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
Romans,2,26,"So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?"
Romans,2,27,"And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law?"
Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh."
Romans,2,29,"But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God."
Romans,3,1,Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,"Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God."
Romans,3,3,"What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?"
Romans,3,4,"May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, “THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED.”"
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.)"
Romans,3,6,"May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?"
Romans,3,7,"But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?"
Romans,3,8,"And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), “Let us do evil that good may come”? Their condemnation is just."
Romans,3,9,What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
Romans,3,10,"as it is written, “THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;"
Romans,3,11,"THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;"
Romans,3,12,"ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.”"
Romans,3,13,"“THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING,” “THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS”;"
Romans,3,14,“WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS”;
Romans,3,15,"“THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,"
Romans,3,16,"DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS,"
Romans,3,17,AND THE PATH OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN.”
Romans,3,18,“THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES.”
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God;"
Romans,3,20,because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.
Romans,3,21,"But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,"
Romans,3,22,even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;
Romans,3,23,"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"
Romans,3,24,being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;
Romans,3,25,"whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;"
Romans,3,26,"for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,"Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith."
Romans,3,28,For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.
Romans,3,29,"Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,"
Romans,3,30,since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.
Romans,3,31,"Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law."
Romans,4,1,"What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?"
Romans,4,2,"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God."
Romans,4,3,"For what does the Scripture say? “ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.”"
Romans,4,4,"Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due."
Romans,4,5,"But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,"
Romans,4,6,just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
Romans,4,7,"“BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED."
Romans,4,8,“BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.”
Romans,4,9,"Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, “FAITH WAS CREDITED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.”"
Romans,4,10,"How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised;"
Romans,4,11,"and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them,"
Romans,4,12,"and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised."
Romans,4,13,"For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith."
Romans,4,14,"For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified;"
Romans,4,15,"for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation."
Romans,4,16,"For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,"
Romans,4,17,"(as it is written, “A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU”) in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist."
Romans,4,18,"In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.”"
Romans,4,19,"Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;"
Romans,4,20,"yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,"
Romans,4,21,"and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform."
Romans,4,22,Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Romans,4,23,"Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him,"
Romans,4,24,"but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,"
Romans,4,25,"He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Romans,5,2,through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.
Romans,5,3,"And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;"
Romans,5,4,"and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;"
Romans,5,5,"and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us."
Romans,5,6,"For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."
Romans,5,7,For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
Romans,5,8,"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
Romans,5,9,"Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him."
Romans,5,10,"For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
Romans,5,11,"And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."
Romans,5,12,"Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—"
Romans,5,13,"for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many."
Romans,5,16,"The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification."
Romans,5,17,"For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men."
Romans,5,19,"For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous."
Romans,5,20,"The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,"
Romans,5,21,"so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
Romans,6,2,May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
Romans,6,3,Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
Romans,6,4,"Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life."
Romans,6,5,"For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,"
Romans,6,6,"knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;"
Romans,6,7,for he who has died is freed from sin.
Romans,6,8,"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,"
Romans,6,9,"knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him."
Romans,6,10,"For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God."
Romans,6,11,"Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus."
Romans,6,12,"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts,"
Romans,6,13,"and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God."
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace."
Romans,6,15,What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!
Romans,6,16,"Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?"
Romans,6,17,"But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed,"
Romans,6,18,"and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness."
Romans,6,19,"I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification."
Romans,6,20,"For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness."
Romans,6,21,Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.
Romans,6,22,"But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life."
Romans,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,7,1,"Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives?"
Romans,7,2,"For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband."
Romans,7,3,"So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man."
Romans,7,4,"Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God."
Romans,7,5,"For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death."
Romans,7,6,"But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter."
Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, “YOU SHALL NOT COVET.”"
Romans,7,8,"But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead."
Romans,7,9,"I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died;"
Romans,7,10,"and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;"
Romans,7,11,"for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me."
Romans,7,12,"So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good."
Romans,7,13,"Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin."
Romans,7,15,"For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate."
Romans,7,16,"But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good."
Romans,7,17,"So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me."
Romans,7,18,"For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not."
Romans,7,19,"For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want."
Romans,7,20,"But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good."
Romans,7,22,"For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man,"
Romans,7,23,"but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members."
Romans,7,24,Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?
Romans,7,25,"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin."
Romans,8,1,Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
Romans,8,3,"For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,"
Romans,8,4,"so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."
Romans,8,5,"For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit."
Romans,8,6,"For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,"
Romans,8,7,"because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,"
Romans,8,8,and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans,8,9,"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."
Romans,8,10,"If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness."
Romans,8,11,"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you."
Romans,8,12,"So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh—"
Romans,8,13,"for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live."
Romans,8,14,"For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."
Romans,8,15,"For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!”"
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,"
Romans,8,17,"and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him."
Romans,8,18,For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
Romans,8,19,For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans,8,20,"For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope"
Romans,8,21,that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.
Romans,8,23,"And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body."
Romans,8,24,"For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?"
Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it."
Romans,8,26,"In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;"
Romans,8,27,"and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God."
Romans,8,28,"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."
Romans,8,29,"For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;"
Romans,8,30,"and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?"
Romans,8,33,Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies;
Romans,8,34,"who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us."
Romans,8,35,"Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"Just as it is written, “FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED.”"
Romans,8,37,But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.
Romans,8,38,"For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,"
Romans,8,39,"nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,9,1,"I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,"
Romans,9,2,that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
Romans,9,3,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,"
Romans,9,4,"who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises,"
Romans,9,5,"whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen."
Romans,9,6,But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;
Romans,9,7,"nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.”"
Romans,9,8,"That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants."
Romans,9,9,"For this is the word of promise: “AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.”"
Romans,9,10,"And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;"
Romans,9,11,"for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,"
Romans,9,12,"it was said to her, “THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.”"
Romans,9,13,"Just as it is written, “JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.”"
Romans,9,14,"What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!"
Romans,9,15,"For He says to Moses, “I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.”"
Romans,9,16,"So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy."
Romans,9,17,"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.”"
Romans,9,18,"So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires."
Romans,9,19,"You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?”"
Romans,9,20,"On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, “Why did you make me like this,” will it?"
Romans,9,21,"Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?"
Romans,9,22,"What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?"
Romans,9,23,"And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,"
Romans,9,24,"even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles."
Romans,9,25,"As He says also in Hosea, “I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, ‘MY PEOPLE,’ AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, ‘BELOVED.’”"
Romans,9,26,"“AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, ‘YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,’ THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.”"
Romans,9,27,"Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED;"
Romans,9,28,"FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.”"
Romans,9,29,"And just as Isaiah foretold, “UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.”"
Romans,9,30,"What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;"
Romans,9,31,"but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law."
Romans,9,32,"Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,"
Romans,9,33,"just as it is written, “BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.”"
Romans,10,1,"Brethren, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation."
Romans,10,2,"For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge."
Romans,10,3,"For not knowing about God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God."
Romans,10,4,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
Romans,10,5,For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.
Romans,10,6,"But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: “DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, ‘WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?’ (that is, to bring Christ down),"
Romans,10,7,"or ‘WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”"
Romans,10,8,"But what does it say? “THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART”—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,"
Romans,10,9,"that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;"
Romans,10,10,"for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation."
Romans,10,11,"For the Scripture says, “WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.”"
Romans,10,12,"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;"
Romans,10,13,for “WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.”
Romans,10,14,How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?
Romans,10,15,"How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!”"
Romans,10,16,"However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, “LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?”"
Romans,10,17,"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."
Romans,10,18,"But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; “THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.”"
Romans,10,19,"But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, “I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.”"
Romans,10,20,"And Isaiah is very bold and says, “I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.”"
Romans,10,21,"But as for Israel He says, “ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.”"
Romans,11,1,"I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
Romans,11,2,"God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?"
Romans,11,3,"“Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.”"
Romans,11,4,But what is the divine response to him? “I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.”
Romans,11,5,"In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God’s gracious choice."
Romans,11,6,"But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace."
Romans,11,7,"What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;"
Romans,11,8,"just as it is written, “GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.”"
Romans,11,9,"And David says, “LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM."
Romans,11,10,"“LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.”"
Romans,11,11,"I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous."
Romans,11,12,"Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!"
Romans,11,13,"But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,"
Romans,11,14,if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
Romans,11,15,"For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?"
Romans,11,16,"If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too."
Romans,11,17,"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,"
Romans,11,18,"do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you."
Romans,11,19,"You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”"
Romans,11,20,"Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;"
Romans,11,21,"for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either."
Romans,11,22,"Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God’s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off."
Romans,11,23,"And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again."
Romans,11,24,"For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?"
Romans,11,25,"For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;"
Romans,11,26,"and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, “THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.”"
Romans,11,27,"“THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.”"
Romans,11,28,"From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God’s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;"
Romans,11,29,for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans,11,30,"For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,"
Romans,11,31,"so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy."
Romans,11,32,For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.
Romans,11,33,"Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!"
Romans,11,34,"For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?"
Romans,11,35,Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?
Romans,11,36,For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
Romans,12,1,"Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship."
Romans,12,2,"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
Romans,12,3,"For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith."
Romans,12,4,"For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,"
Romans,12,5,"so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."
Romans,12,6,"Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;"
Romans,12,7,"if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;"
Romans,12,8,"or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness."
Romans,12,9,Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
Romans,12,10,Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor;
Romans,12,11,"not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;"
Romans,12,12,"rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,"
Romans,12,13,"contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality."
Romans,12,14,Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Romans,12,15,"Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep."
Romans,12,16,"Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation."
Romans,12,17,Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
Romans,12,18,"If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men."
Romans,12,19,"Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,” says the Lord."
Romans,12,20,"“BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD.”"
Romans,12,21,"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
Romans,13,1,"Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God."
Romans,13,2,Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
Romans,13,3,"For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;"
Romans,13,4,"for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil."
Romans,13,5,"Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience’ sake."
Romans,13,6,"For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing."
Romans,13,7,Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
Romans,13,8,Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
Romans,13,9,"For this, “YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT COVET,” and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, “YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”"
Romans,13,10,Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
Romans,13,11,"Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed."
Romans,13,12,"The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light."
Romans,13,13,"Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy."
Romans,13,14,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts."
Romans,14,1,"Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions."
Romans,14,2,"One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only."
Romans,14,3,"The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him."
Romans,14,4,"Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand."
Romans,14,5,"One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind."
Romans,14,6,"He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God."
Romans,14,7,"For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself;"
Romans,14,8,"for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s."
Romans,14,9,"For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living."
Romans,14,10,"But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God."
Romans,14,11,"For it is written, “AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL GIVE PRAISE TO GOD.”"
Romans,14,12,So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.
Romans,14,13,"Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this—not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother’s way."
Romans,14,14,"I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
Romans,14,15,"For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died."
Romans,14,16,Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil;
Romans,14,17,"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
Romans,14,18,For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
Romans,14,19,So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.
Romans,14,20,"Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense."
Romans,14,21,"It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles."
Romans,14,22,"The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves."
Romans,14,23,"But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin."
Romans,15,1,Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves.
Romans,15,2,"Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification."
Romans,15,3,"For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, “THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED YOU FELL ON ME.”"
Romans,15,4,"For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope."
Romans,15,5,"Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus,"
Romans,15,6,so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans,15,7,"Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God."
Romans,15,8,"For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers,"
Romans,15,9,"and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, “THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO YOUR NAME.”"
Romans,15,10,"Again he says, “REJOICE, O GENTILES, WITH HIS PEOPLE.”"
Romans,15,11,"And again, “PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES, AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE HIM.”"
Romans,15,12,"Again Isaiah says, “THERE SHALL COME THE ROOT OF JESSE, AND HE WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE GENTILES, IN HIM SHALL THE GENTILES HOPE.”"
Romans,15,13,"Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."
Romans,15,14,"And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another."
Romans,15,15,"But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,"
Romans,15,16,"to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
Romans,15,17,Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.
Romans,15,18,"For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,"
Romans,15,19,"in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
Romans,15,20,"And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build on another man’s foundation;"
Romans,15,21,"but as it is written, “THEY WHO HAD NO NEWS OF HIM SHALL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALL UNDERSTAND.”"
Romans,15,22,For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;
Romans,15,23,"but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you"
Romans,15,24,"whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while—"
Romans,15,25,"but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints."
Romans,15,26,For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
Romans,15,27,"Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things."
Romans,15,28,"Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain."
Romans,15,29,"I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ."
Romans,15,30,"Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,"
Romans,15,31,"that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;"
Romans,15,32,so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company.
Romans,15,33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans,16,1,"I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea;"
Romans,16,2,"that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well."
Romans,16,3,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,"
Romans,16,4,"who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles;"
Romans,16,5,"also greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia."
Romans,16,6,"Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you."
Romans,16,7,"Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
Romans,16,8,"Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord."
Romans,16,9,"Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
Romans,16,10,"Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus."
Romans,16,11,"Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord."
Romans,16,12,"Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord."
Romans,16,13,"Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine."
Romans,16,14,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them."
Romans,16,15,"Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them."
Romans,16,16,Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
Romans,16,17,"Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them."
Romans,16,18,"For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting."
Romans,16,19,"For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil."
Romans,16,20,The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
Romans,16,21,"Timothy my fellow worker greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen."
Romans,16,22,"I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord."
Romans,16,23,"Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus, the brother."
Romans,16,24,[The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.]
Romans,16,25,"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,"
Romans,16,26,"but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith;"
Romans,16,27,"to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
1 Corinthians,1,2,"To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,1,4,"I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,"
1 Corinthians,1,5,"that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge,"
1 Corinthians,1,6,"even as the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you,"
1 Corinthians,1,7,"so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Corinthians,1,8,"who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment."
1 Corinthians,1,11,"For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe’s people, that there are quarrels among you."
1 Corinthians,1,12,"Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, “I am of Paul,” and “I of Apollos,” and “I of Cephas,” and “I of Christ.”"
1 Corinthians,1,13,"Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
1 Corinthians,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,"
1 Corinthians,1,15,so that no one would say you were baptized in my name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other."
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void."
1 Corinthians,1,18,"For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, “I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE, AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE.”"
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
1 Corinthians,1,21,"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe."
1 Corinthians,1,22,For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;
1 Corinthians,1,23,"but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,"
1 Corinthians,1,24,"but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
1 Corinthians,1,25,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
1 Corinthians,1,26,"For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;"
1 Corinthians,1,27,"but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,"
1 Corinthians,1,28,"and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are,"
1 Corinthians,1,29,so that no man may boast before God.
1 Corinthians,1,30,"But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,"
1 Corinthians,1,31,"so that, just as it is written, “LET HIM WHO BOASTS, BOAST IN THE LORD.”"
1 Corinthians,2,1,"And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God."
1 Corinthians,2,2,"For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified."
1 Corinthians,2,3,"I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,"
1 Corinthians,2,4,"and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"
1 Corinthians,2,5,"so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God."
1 Corinthians,2,6,"Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away;"
1 Corinthians,2,7,"but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory;"
1 Corinthians,2,8,the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
1 Corinthians,2,9,"but just as it is written, “THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.”"
1 Corinthians,2,10,"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,"
1 Corinthians,2,13,"which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words."
1 Corinthians,2,14,"But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised."
1 Corinthians,2,15,"But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one."
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,"
1 Corinthians,3,3,"for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?"
1 Corinthians,3,4,"For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not mere men?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one."
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth."
1 Corinthians,3,8,Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
1 Corinthians,3,9,"For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building."
1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,12,"Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,"
1 Corinthians,3,13,"each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work."
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If any man’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward."
1 Corinthians,3,15,"If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire."
1 Corinthians,3,16,Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, “He is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS”;"
1 Corinthians,3,20,"and again, “THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS.”"
1 Corinthians,3,21,"So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you,"
1 Corinthians,3,22,"whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,"
1 Corinthians,3,23,and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy."
1 Corinthians,4,3,"But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you, or by any human court; in fact, I do not even examine myself."
1 Corinthians,4,4,"For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord."
1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men’s hearts; and then each man’s praise will come to him from God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who regards you as superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"You are already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you."
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor."
1 Corinthians,4,11,"To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly treated, and are homeless;"
1 Corinthians,4,12,"and we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;"
1 Corinthians,4,13,"when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become as the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, even until now."
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel."
1 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church."
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power."
1 Corinthians,4,20,For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power.
1 Corinthians,4,21,"What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father’s wife."
1 Corinthians,5,2,"You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present."
1 Corinthians,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,"
1 Corinthians,5,5,"I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed."
1 Corinthians,5,8,"Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;
1 Corinthians,5,10,"I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world."
1 Corinthians,5,11,"But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one."
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within the church?
1 Corinthians,5,13,"But those who are outside, God judges. REMOVE THE WICKED MAN FROM AMONG YOURSELVES."
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints?"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life?
1 Corinthians,6,4,"So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?"
1 Corinthians,6,5,"I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his brethren,"
1 Corinthians,6,6,"but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?"
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud. You do this even to your brethren."
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,"
1 Corinthians,6,10,"nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
1 Corinthians,6,12,"All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body."
1 Corinthians,6,14,"Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power."
1 Corinthians,6,15,Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!
1 Corinthians,6,16,"Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, “THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.”"
1 Corinthians,6,17,But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
1 Corinthians,6,18,"Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body."
1 Corinthians,6,19,"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?"
1 Corinthians,6,20,For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.
1 Corinthians,7,1,"Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman."
1 Corinthians,7,2,"But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,"The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But this I say by way of concession, not of command."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not send her husband away."
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy."
1 Corinthians,7,15,"Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches."
1 Corinthians,7,18,Was any man called when he was already circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised.
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God."
1 Corinthians,7,20,Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord’s freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is Christ’s slave."
1 Corinthians,7,23,You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called."
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy."
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is."
1 Corinthians,7,27,Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none;"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of this world is passing away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;"
1 Corinthians,7,33,"but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife,"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"and his interests are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well."
1 Corinthians,7,38,"So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,40,But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know;"
1 Corinthians,8,3,"but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one."
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,"
1 Corinthians,8,6,"yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled."
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat."
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died."
1 Corinthians,8,12,"And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ."
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,My defense to those who examine me is this:
1 Corinthians,9,4,Do we not have a right to eat and drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?"
1 Corinthians,9,6,Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working?
1 Corinthians,9,7,Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians,9,8,"I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things?"
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the Law of Moses, “YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING.” God is not concerned about oxen, is He?"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ."
1 Corinthians,9,13,"Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple, and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share from the altar?"
1 Corinthians,9,14,So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
1 Corinthians,9,15,But I have used none of these things. And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one.
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me."
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I may win more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law;"
1 Corinthians,9,21,"to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law."
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some."
1 Corinthians,9,23,"I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it."
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win."
1 Corinthians,9,25,"Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable."
1 Corinthians,9,26,"Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air;"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;"
1 Corinthians,10,2,and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians,10,3,and all ate the same spiritual food;
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, “THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY.”"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall.
1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians,10,17,"Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
1 Corinthians,10,22,"Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?"
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor."
1 Corinthians,10,25,Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience’ sake;
1 Corinthians,10,26,"FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD’S, AND ALL IT CONTAINS."
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake;"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"I mean not your own conscience, but the other man’s; for why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God;
1 Corinthians,10,33,"just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,4,Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.
1 Corinthians,11,5,"But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved."
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;"
1 Corinthians,11,9,"for indeed man was not created for the woman’s sake, but woman for the man’s sake."
1 Corinthians,11,10,"Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper,"
1 Corinthians,11,21,for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk.
1 Corinthians,11,22,What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly."
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the mute idols, however you were led."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
1 Corinthians,12,8,"For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body."
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body."
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"If they were all one member, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now there are many members, but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"and those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable,"
1 Corinthians,12,24,"whereas our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked,"
1 Corinthians,12,25,"so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you are Christ’s body, and individually members of it."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,"All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they?"
1 Corinthians,12,30,"All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?"
1 Corinthians,12,31,But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away."
1 Corinthians,13,9,For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
1 Corinthians,13,10,"but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries."
1 Corinthians,14,3,But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation.
1 Corinthians,14,4,One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church.
1 Corinthians,14,5,"Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Yet even lifeless things, either flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no kind is without meaning."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;"
1 Corinthians,14,19,"however, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the Law it is written, “BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME,” says the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers but to those who believe."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you."
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret;"
1 Corinthians,14,28,"but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one must keep silent."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted;"
1 Corinthians,14,32,and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;
1 Corinthians,14,33,"for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,Was it from you that the word of God first went forth? Or has it come to you only?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord’s commandment."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve."
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;"
1 Corinthians,15,7,"then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;"
1 Corinthians,15,8,"and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised;"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;"
1 Corinthians,15,17,"and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ’s at His coming,"
1 Corinthians,15,24,"then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,Why are we also in danger every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I affirm, brethren, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, LET US EAT AND DRINK, FOR TOMORROW WE DIE."
1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies;
1 Corinthians,15,37,"and that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body;"
1 Corinthians,15,43,"it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;"
1 Corinthians,15,44,"it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"So also it is written, “The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, “DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory."
1 Corinthians,15,55,"O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?”"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;"
1 Corinthians,15,57,"but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also."
1 Corinthians,16,2,"On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;"
1 Corinthians,16,4,"and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,"But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia;"
1 Corinthians,16,6,"and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I do not wish to see you now just in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits."
1 Corinthians,16,8,But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;
1 Corinthians,16,9,"for a wide door for effective service has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to be afraid, for he is doing the Lord’s work, as I also am."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"So let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all that you do be done in love.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"Now I urge you, brethren (you know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints),"
1 Corinthians,16,16,that you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
1 Corinthians,16,17,"I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part."
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,The greeting is in my own hand—Paul.
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha."
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:"
2 Corinthians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,"
2 Corinthians,1,4,who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
2 Corinthians,1,5,"For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer;"
2 Corinthians,1,7,"and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are sharers of our comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life;"
2 Corinthians,1,9,"indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;"
2 Corinthians,1,10,"who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and will deliver us, He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,"
2 Corinthians,1,11,"you also joining in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through the prayers of many."
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end;"
2 Corinthians,1,14,"just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that you might twice receive a blessing;"
2 Corinthians,1,16,"that is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there will be yes, yes and no, no at the same time?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not yes and no, but is yes in Him."
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,"
2 Corinthians,1,22,who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
2 Corinthians,1,23,"But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"Not that we lord it over your faith, but are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again."
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree—in order not to say too much—to all of you."
2 Corinthians,2,6,"Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority,"
2 Corinthians,2,7,"so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,8,Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
2 Corinthians,2,9,"For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things."
2 Corinthians,2,10,"But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ,"
2 Corinthians,2,11,"so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes."
2 Corinthians,2,12,"Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place."
2 Corinthians,2,15,For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;
2 Corinthians,2,16,"to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;"
2 Corinthians,3,3,"being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."
2 Corinthians,3,4,Such confidence we have through Christ toward God.
2 Corinthians,3,5,"Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,"
2 Corinthians,3,6,"who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading as it was,"
2 Corinthians,3,8,how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,10,"For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Therefore having such a hope, we use great boldness in our speech,"
2 Corinthians,3,13,"and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was fading away."
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart;"
2 Corinthians,3,16,"but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,"
2 Corinthians,4,2,"but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,"
2 Corinthians,4,4,"in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake."
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;"
2 Corinthians,4,8,"we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;"
2 Corinthians,4,9,"persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;"
2 Corinthians,4,10,"always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So death works in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,"
2 Corinthians,4,14,knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you.
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,"
2 Corinthians,4,18,"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven,"
2 Corinthians,5,3,"inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked."
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—"
2 Corinthians,5,7,"for we walk by faith, not by sight—"
2 Corinthians,5,8,"we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,9,"Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not again commending ourselves to you but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;"
2 Corinthians,5,15,"and He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come."
2 Corinthians,5,18,"Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain—"
2 Corinthians,6,2,"for He says, “AT THE ACCEPTABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU, AND ON THE DAY OF SALVATION I HELPED YOU.” Behold, now is “THE ACCEPTABLE TIME,” behold, now is “THE DAY OF SALVATION”—"
2 Corinthians,6,3,"giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited,"
2 Corinthians,6,4,"but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger,"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,"
2 Corinthians,6,7,"in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left,"
2 Corinthians,6,8,"by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,"as unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death,"
2 Corinthians,6,10,"as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections."
2 Corinthians,6,13,Now in a like exchange—I speak as to children—open wide to us also.
2 Corinthians,6,14,"Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?"
2 Corinthians,6,15,"Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?"
2 Corinthians,6,16,"Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, “I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"“Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE,” says the Lord. “AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I will welcome you."
2 Corinthians,6,18,"“And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,” Says the Lord Almighty."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Make room for us in your hearts; we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together."
2 Corinthians,7,4,Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
2 Corinthians,7,7,"and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while—"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death."
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"His affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling."
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,"
2 Corinthians,8,2,that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord,"
2 Corinthians,8,4,"begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints,"
2 Corinthians,8,5,"and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you abound in this gracious work also."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,"I give my opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it."
2 Corinthians,8,11,"But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your ability."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have."
2 Corinthians,8,13,"For this is not for the ease of others and for your affliction, but by way of equality—"
2 Corinthians,8,14,"at this present time your abundance being a supply for their need, so that their abundance also may become a supply for your need, that there may be equality;"
2 Corinthians,8,15,"as it is written, “HE WHO gathered MUCH DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH, AND HE WHO gathered LITTLE HAD NO LACK.”"
2 Corinthians,8,16,But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus.
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord."
2 Corinthians,8,18,We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in the things of the gospel has spread through all the churches;
2 Corinthians,8,19,"and not only this, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and to show our readiness,"
2 Corinthians,8,20,taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift;
2 Corinthians,8,21,"for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you."
2 Corinthians,9,1,For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints;
2 Corinthians,9,2,"for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, namely, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you may be prepared;"
2 Corinthians,9,4,"otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to speak of you—will be put to shame by this confidence."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed;"
2 Corinthians,9,9,"as it is written, “HE SCATTERED ABROAD, HE GAVE TO THE POOR, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER.”"
2 Corinthians,9,10,Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness;
2 Corinthians,9,11,"you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God."
2 Corinthians,9,12,"For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God."
2 Corinthians,9,13,"Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,"
2 Corinthians,9,14,"while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you."
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent!"
2 Corinthians,10,2,"I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,"
2 Corinthians,10,4,"for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses."
2 Corinthians,10,5,"We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,"
2 Corinthians,10,6,"and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ’s, so also are we."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be put to shame,"
2 Corinthians,10,9,for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.”"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons we are also in deed when present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even as far as you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ;"
2 Corinthians,10,15,"not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men’s labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged even more by you,"
2 Corinthians,10,16,"so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another."
2 Corinthians,10,17,But HE WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD.
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends."
2 Corinthians,11,1,I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me.
2 Corinthians,11,2,"For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this beautifully."
2 Corinthians,11,5,For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles.
2 Corinthians,11,6,"But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not so in knowledge; in fact, in every way we have made this evident to you in all things."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?"
2 Corinthians,11,8,I robbed other churches by taking wages from them to serve you;
2 Corinthians,11,9,"and when I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia."
2 Corinthians,11,11,Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
2 Corinthians,11,12,"But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting."
2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,"No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."
2 Corinthians,11,15,"Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds."
2 Corinthians,11,16,"Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if you do, receive me even as foolish, so that I also may boast a little."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Since many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"For you, being so wise, tolerate the foolish gladly."
2 Corinthians,11,20,"For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,To my shame I must say that we have been weak by comparison. But in whatever respect anyone else is bold—I speak in foolishness—I am just as bold myself.
2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ?—I speak as if insane—I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death."
2 Corinthians,11,24,Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine lashes.
2 Corinthians,11,25,"Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep."
2 Corinthians,11,26,"I have been on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren;"
2 Corinthians,11,27,"I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure."
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying."
2 Corinthians,11,32,"In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me,"
2 Corinthians,11,33,"and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands."
2 Corinthians,12,1,"Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord."
2 Corinthians,12,2,"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven."
2 Corinthians,12,3,"And I know how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain from this, so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me."
2 Corinthians,12,7,"Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!"
2 Corinthians,12,8,Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me.
2 Corinthians,12,9,"And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!"
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?"
2 Corinthians,12,16,"But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit."
2 Corinthians,12,17,"Certainly I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I?"
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?"
2 Corinthians,12,19,"All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Actually, it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances;"
2 Corinthians,12,21,"I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced."
2 Corinthians,13,1,This is the third time I am coming to you. EVERY FACT IS TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES.
2 Corinthians,13,2,"I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well, that if I come again I will not spare anyone,"
2 Corinthians,13,3,"since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, and who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him because of the power of God directed toward you."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you—unless indeed you fail the test?"
2 Corinthians,13,6,But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test.
2 Corinthians,13,7,"Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear unapproved."
2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,"For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you be made complete."
2 Corinthians,13,10,"For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."
Galatians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),"
Galatians,1,2,"and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:"
Galatians,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,1,4,"who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"
Galatians,1,5,to whom be the glory forevermore. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,"I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;"
Galatians,1,7,which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
Galatians,1,8,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!"
Galatians,1,9,"As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!"
Galatians,1,10,"For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man."
Galatians,1,12,"For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
Galatians,1,13,"For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;"
Galatians,1,14,"and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions."
Galatians,1,15,"But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased"
Galatians,1,16,"to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,"
Galatians,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus."
Galatians,1,18,"Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days."
Galatians,1,19,"But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,"(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)"
Galatians,1,21,Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians,1,22,I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;
Galatians,1,23,"but only, they kept hearing, “He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.”"
Galatians,1,24,And they were glorifying God because of me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also."
Galatians,2,2,"It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
Galatians,2,4,"But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage."
Galatians,2,5,"But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you."
Galatians,2,6,"But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me."
Galatians,2,7,"But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised"
Galatians,2,8,"(for He who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),"
Galatians,2,9,"and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,10,They only asked us to remember the poor—the very thing I also was eager to do.
Galatians,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned."
Galatians,2,12,"For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision."
Galatians,2,13,"The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy."
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, “If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
Galatians,2,15,“We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles;
Galatians,2,16,"nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!"
Galatians,2,18,"For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor."
Galatians,2,19,"For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God."
Galatians,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.”"
Galatians,3,1,"You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?"
Galatians,3,2,"This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain?
Galatians,3,5,"So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?"
Galatians,3,6,"Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS."
Galatians,3,7,"Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham."
Galatians,3,8,"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.”"
Galatians,3,9,"So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer."
Galatians,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, “CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.”"
Galatians,3,11,"Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, “THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.”"
Galatians,3,12,"However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, “HE WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM.”"
Galatians,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE”—"
Galatians,3,14,"in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
Galatians,3,15,"Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it."
Galatians,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as referring to many, but rather to one, “And to your seed,” that is, Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise."
Galatians,3,19,"Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made."
Galatians,3,20,Now a mediator is not for one party only; whereas God is only one.
Galatians,3,21,"Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
Galatians,3,26,For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
Galatians,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything,"
Galatians,4,2,but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father.
Galatians,4,3,"So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world."
Galatians,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,"
Galatians,4,5,"so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons."
Galatians,4,6,"Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”"
Galatians,4,7,"Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God."
Galatians,4,8,"However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?"
Galatians,4,10,You observe days and months and seasons and years.
Galatians,4,11,"I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain."
Galatians,4,12,"I beg of you, brethren, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;"
Galatians,4,13,but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time;
Galatians,4,14,"and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself."
Galatians,4,15,"Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians,4,17,"They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them."
Galatians,4,18,"But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you—"
Galatians,4,20,"but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you."
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman."
Galatians,4,23,"But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise."
Galatians,4,24,"This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants: one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar."
Galatians,4,25,"Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children."
Galatians,4,26,But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother.
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written, “REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR; FOR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND.”"
Galatians,4,28,"And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also."
Galatians,4,30,"But what does the Scripture say? “CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON, FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN.”"
Galatians,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman."
Galatians,5,1,It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.
Galatians,5,2,"Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you."
Galatians,5,3,"And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law."
Galatians,5,4,"You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace."
Galatians,5,5,"For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness."
Galatians,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love."
Galatians,5,7,You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you.
Galatians,5,9,A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.
Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is."
Galatians,5,11,"But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished."
Galatians,5,12,I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.
Galatians,5,13,"For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another."
Galatians,5,14,"For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”"
Galatians,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another."
Galatians,5,16,"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,"
Galatians,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,"
Galatians,5,21,"envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,"
Galatians,5,23,"gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians,5,25,"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,"Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ."
Galatians,6,3,"For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another."
Galatians,6,5,For each one will bear his own load.
Galatians,6,6,The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him.
Galatians,6,7,"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."
Galatians,6,8,"For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life."
Galatians,6,9,"Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary."
Galatians,6,10,"So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith."
Galatians,6,11,See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
Galatians,6,12,"Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ."
Galatians,6,13,"For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
Galatians,6,15,"For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
Galatians,6,16,"And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God."
Galatians,6,17,"From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus."
Galatians,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen."
Ephesians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus:"
Ephesians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,"
Ephesians,1,4,"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love"
Ephesians,1,5,"He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,"
Ephesians,1,6,"to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved."
Ephesians,1,7,"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace"
Ephesians,1,8,which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight
Ephesians,1,9,"He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him"
Ephesians,1,10,"with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him"
Ephesians,1,11,"also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,"
