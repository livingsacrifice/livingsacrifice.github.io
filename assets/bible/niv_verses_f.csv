1 Corinthians,10,3,They all ate the same spiritual food
1 Corinthians,10,4,"and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"We should not test Christ, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,"So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!"
1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians,10,17,"Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
1 Corinthians,10,22,Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians,10,23,"“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"No one should seek their own good, but the good of others."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,"
1 Corinthians,10,26,"for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”"
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience."
1 Corinthians,10,29,"I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God."
1 Corinthians,11,4,Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
1 Corinthians,11,5,But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved.
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;"
1 Corinthians,11,9,"neither was man created for woman, but woman for man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,"It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels."
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval.
1 Corinthians,11,20,"So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat,"
1 Corinthians,11,21,"for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk."
1 Corinthians,11,22,Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,28,Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
1 Corinthians,11,29,For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.
1 Corinthians,11,30,"That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work."
1 Corinthians,12,7,Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
1 Corinthians,12,8,"To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink."
1 Corinthians,12,14,Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.
1 Corinthians,12,15,"Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body."
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body."
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"If they were all one part, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"As it is, there are many parts, but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,"
1 Corinthians,12,24,"while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it,"
1 Corinthians,12,25,"so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,And yet I will show you the most excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud."
1 Corinthians,13,5,"It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs."
1 Corinthians,13,6,Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
1 Corinthians,13,7,"It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part and we prophesy in part,"
1 Corinthians,13,10,"but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort."
1 Corinthians,14,4,"Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
1 Corinthians,14,19,But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the Law it is written: “With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”"
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all,"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!”"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop."
1 Corinthians,14,31,For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
1 Corinthians,14,32,The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand."
1 Corinthians,15,2,"By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve."
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,"
1 Corinthians,15,8,"and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised."
1 Corinthians,15,14,"And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either."
1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,"And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?"
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”"
1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
1 Corinthians,15,37,"When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;"
1 Corinthians,15,43,"it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;"
1 Corinthians,15,44,"it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven.
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”"
1 Corinthians,15,55,"“Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
1 Corinthians,15,57,But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."
1 Corinthians,16,1,Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.
1 Corinthians,16,2,"On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem."
1 Corinthians,16,4,"If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,"After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia."
1 Corinthians,16,6,"Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits."
1 Corinthians,16,8,"But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,"
1 Corinthians,16,9,"because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity."
1 Corinthians,16,13,Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
1 Corinthians,16,14,Do everything in love.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters,"
1 Corinthians,16,16,to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it.
1 Corinthians,16,17,"I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you."
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,"I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand."
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord!"
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout Achaia:"
2 Corinthians,1,2,Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,"
2 Corinthians,1,4,"who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself."
2 Corinthians,1,9,"Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead."
2 Corinthians,1,10,"He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,"
2 Corinthians,1,11,as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
2 Corinthians,1,12,"Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God’s grace."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,"
2 Corinthians,1,14,"as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice."
2 Corinthians,1,16,"I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"Was I fickle when I intended to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”"
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silas and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always been “Yes.”"
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,"
2 Corinthians,1,22,"set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come."
2 Corinthians,1,23,I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
2 Corinthians,1,24,"Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm."
2 Corinthians,2,1,So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent—not to put it too severely."
2 Corinthians,2,6,The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient.
2 Corinthians,2,7,"Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,8,"I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him."
2 Corinthians,2,9,Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
2 Corinthians,2,10,"Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,"
2 Corinthians,2,11,in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
2 Corinthians,2,12,"Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere."
2 Corinthians,2,15,For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
2 Corinthians,2,16,"To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task?"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone."
2 Corinthians,3,3,"You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."
2 Corinthians,3,4,Such confidence we have through Christ before God.
2 Corinthians,3,5,"Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God."
2 Corinthians,3,6,"He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was,"
2 Corinthians,3,8,will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!"
2 Corinthians,3,10,For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
2 Corinthians,3,11,"And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!"
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold."
2 Corinthians,3,13,"We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away."
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts."
2 Corinthians,3,16,"But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart."
2 Corinthians,4,2,"Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."
2 Corinthians,4,4,"The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake."
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ."
2 Corinthians,4,7,But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
2 Corinthians,4,8,"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;"
2 Corinthians,4,9,"persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed."
2 Corinthians,4,10,"We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.” Since we have that same spirit of faith, we also believe and therefore speak,"
2 Corinthians,4,14,because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself.
2 Corinthians,4,15,"All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
2 Corinthians,4,18,"So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,"
2 Corinthians,5,3,"because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked."
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come."
2 Corinthians,5,6,Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.
2 Corinthians,5,7,"For we live by faith, not by sight."
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,9,"So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"If we are “out of our mind,” as some say, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died."
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"
2 Corinthians,5,18,"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
2 Corinthians,6,1,As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.
2 Corinthians,6,2,"For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation."
2 Corinthians,6,3,"We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited."
2 Corinthians,6,4,"Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;"
2 Corinthians,6,7,in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
2 Corinthians,6,8,"through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,"known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;"
2 Corinthians,6,10,"sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us."
2 Corinthians,6,13,As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.
2 Corinthians,6,14,Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
2 Corinthians,6,15,What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”"
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Therefore, “Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”"
2 Corinthians,6,18,"And, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”"
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one."
2 Corinthians,7,3,I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.
2 Corinthians,7,4,I have spoken to you with great frankness; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,"
2 Corinthians,7,7,"and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it—I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while—"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death."
2 Corinthians,7,11,"See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"So even though I wrote to you, it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling."
2 Corinthians,7,16,I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches."
2 Corinthians,8,2,"In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity."
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,"
2 Corinthians,8,4,they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord’s people.
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you—see that you also excel in this grace of giving."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
2 Corinthians,8,11,"Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have."
2 Corinthians,8,13,"Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality."
2 Corinthians,8,14,"At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality,"
2 Corinthians,8,15,"as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”"
2 Corinthians,8,16,"Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative."
2 Corinthians,8,18,And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.
2 Corinthians,8,19,"What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help."
2 Corinthians,8,20,We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.
2 Corinthians,8,21,"For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it."
2 Corinthians,9,1,There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s people.
2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be."
2 Corinthians,9,4,"For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously."
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work."
2 Corinthians,9,9,As it is written: “They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever.”
2 Corinthians,9,10,Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
2 Corinthians,9,11,"You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God."
2 Corinthians,9,12,This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
2 Corinthians,9,13,"Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else."
2 Corinthians,9,14,"And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you."
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
2 Corinthians,10,1,"By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away!"
2 Corinthians,10,2,I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does."
2 Corinthians,10,4,"The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds."
2 Corinthians,10,5,"We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."
2 Corinthians,10,6,"And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"You are judging by appearances. If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it."
2 Corinthians,10,9,I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.”"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ."
2 Corinthians,10,15,"Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand,"
2 Corinthians,10,16,so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else’s territory.
2 Corinthians,10,17,"But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”"
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends."
2 Corinthians,11,1,"I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me!"
2 Corinthians,11,2,"I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough."
2 Corinthians,11,5,I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super-apostles.”
2 Corinthians,11,6,"I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way."
2 Corinthians,11,7,Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?
2 Corinthians,11,8,I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.
2 Corinthians,11,9,"And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine."
2 Corinthians,11,11,Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
2 Corinthians,11,12,And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.
2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,"And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light."
2 Corinthians,11,15,"It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve."
2 Corinthians,11,16,"I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast."
2 Corinthians,11,19,You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!
2 Corinthians,11,20,"In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! Whatever anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about.
2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I.
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again."
2 Corinthians,11,24,Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
2 Corinthians,11,25,"Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,"
2 Corinthians,11,26,"I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers."
2 Corinthians,11,27,I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,"Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?"
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying."
2 Corinthians,11,32,In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.
2 Corinthians,11,33,But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
2 Corinthians,12,1,"I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord."
2 Corinthians,12,2,I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows.
2 Corinthians,12,3,"And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows—"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say,"
2 Corinthians,12,7,"or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me."
2 Corinthians,12,8,Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
2 Corinthians,12,9,"But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!"
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?"
2 Corinthians,12,16,"Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!"
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit?"
2 Corinthians,12,19,"Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder."
2 Corinthians,12,21,"I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged."
2 Corinthians,13,1,This will be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”
2 Corinthians,13,2,"I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,"
2 Corinthians,13,3,"since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him in our dealing with you."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?"
2 Corinthians,13,6,And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.
2 Corinthians,13,7,Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.
2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored.
2 Corinthians,13,10,"This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority—the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians,13,13,All God’s people here send their greetings.
2 Corinthians,13,14,"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
Galatians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—"
Galatians,1,2,"and all the brothers and sisters with me, To the churches in Galatia:"
Galatians,1,3,"Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,1,4,"who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"
Galatians,1,5,to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—
Galatians,1,7,which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians,1,8,"But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!"
Galatians,1,9,"As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!"
Galatians,1,10,"Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin."
Galatians,1,12,"I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ."
Galatians,1,13,"For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it."
Galatians,1,14,I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians,1,15,"But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased"
Galatians,1,16,"to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being."
Galatians,1,17,"I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus."
Galatians,1,18,"Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days."
Galatians,1,19,"I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
Galatians,1,21,Then I went to Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians,1,22,I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
Galatians,1,23,They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
Galatians,1,24,And they praised God because of me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also."
Galatians,2,2,"I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek."
Galatians,2,4,This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.
Galatians,2,5,"We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you."
Galatians,2,6,As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message.
Galatians,2,7,"On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,8,"For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles."
Galatians,2,9,"James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,10,"All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along."
Galatians,2,11,"When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned."
Galatians,2,12,"For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group."
Galatians,2,13,"The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray."
Galatians,2,14,"When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?"
Galatians,2,15,“We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles
Galatians,2,16,"know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"“But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!"
Galatians,2,18,"If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker."
Galatians,2,19,“For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.
Galatians,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”"
Galatians,3,1,You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
Galatians,3,2,"I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?
Galatians,3,5,"So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?"
Galatians,3,6,"So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”"
Galatians,3,7,"Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham."
Galatians,3,8,"Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”"
Galatians,3,9,"So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith."
Galatians,3,10,"For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”"
Galatians,3,11,"Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.”"
Galatians,3,12,"The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”"
Galatians,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”"
Galatians,3,14,"He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit."
Galatians,3,15,"Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case."
Galatians,3,16,"The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise."
Galatians,3,19,"Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator."
Galatians,3,20,"A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one."
Galatians,3,21,"Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed."
Galatians,3,24,So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians,3,25,"Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian."
Galatians,3,26,"So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith,"
Galatians,3,27,for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
Galatians,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise."
Galatians,4,1,"What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate."
Galatians,4,2,The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
Galatians,4,3,"So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world."
Galatians,4,4,"But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
Galatians,4,5,"to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship."
Galatians,4,6,"Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.”"
Galatians,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir."
Galatians,4,8,"Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods."
Galatians,4,9,But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
Galatians,4,10,You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
Galatians,4,11,"I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you."
Galatians,4,12,"I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong."
Galatians,4,13,"As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you,"
Galatians,4,14,"and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself."
Galatians,4,15,"Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians,4,17,"Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them."
Galatians,4,18,"It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,"
Galatians,4,20,"how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!"
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman."
Galatians,4,23,"His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise."
Galatians,4,24,These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.
Galatians,4,25,"Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children."
Galatians,4,26,"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written: “Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”"
Galatians,4,28,"Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
Galatians,4,30,"But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”"
Galatians,4,31,"Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman."
Galatians,5,1,"It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."
Galatians,5,2,"Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all."
Galatians,5,3,Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
Galatians,5,4,You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
Galatians,5,5,For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope.
Galatians,5,6,For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
Galatians,5,7,You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth?
Galatians,5,8,That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
Galatians,5,9,“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.”
Galatians,5,10,"I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty."
Galatians,5,11,"Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished."
Galatians,5,12,"As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!"
Galatians,5,13,"You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love."
Galatians,5,14,For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
Galatians,5,15,"If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other."
Galatians,5,16,"So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
Galatians,5,19,"The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;"
Galatians,5,20,"idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions"
Galatians,5,21,"and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,"
Galatians,5,23,gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
Galatians,5,24,Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians,5,25,"Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other."
Galatians,6,1,"Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,"Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."
Galatians,6,3,"If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves."
Galatians,6,4,"Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,"
Galatians,6,5,for each one should carry their own load.
Galatians,6,6,"Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor."
Galatians,6,7,Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
Galatians,6,8,"Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life."
Galatians,6,9,"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."
Galatians,6,10,"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers."
Galatians,6,11,See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
Galatians,6,12,Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians,6,13,"Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
Galatians,6,15,Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
Galatians,6,16,Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.
Galatians,6,17,"From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus."
Galatians,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen."
Ephesians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
Ephesians,1,2,Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians,1,3,"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ."
Ephesians,1,4,For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love
Ephesians,1,5,"he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—"
Ephesians,1,6,"to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves."
Ephesians,1,7,"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace"
Ephesians,1,8,"that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding,"
Ephesians,1,9,"he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,"
Ephesians,1,10,to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
Ephesians,1,11,"In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,"
Ephesians,1,12,"in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory."
Ephesians,1,13,"And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,"
Ephesians,1,14,who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.
Ephesians,1,15,"For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people,"
Ephesians,1,16,"I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers."
Ephesians,1,17,"I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better."
Ephesians,1,18,"I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people,"
Ephesians,1,19,and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength
Ephesians,1,20,"he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,"
Ephesians,1,21,"far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come."
Ephesians,1,22,"And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,"
Ephesians,1,23,"which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way."
Ephesians,2,1,"As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,"
Ephesians,2,2,"in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient."
Ephesians,2,3,"All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath."
Ephesians,2,4,"But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,"
Ephesians,2,5,made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.
Ephesians,2,6,"And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,"
Ephesians,2,7,"in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus."
Ephesians,2,8,"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—"
Ephesians,2,9,"not by works, so that no one can boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."
Ephesians,2,11,"Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (which is done in the body by human hands)—"
Ephesians,2,12,"remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world."
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians,2,14,"For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,"
Ephesians,2,15,"by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,"
Ephesians,2,16,"and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility."
Ephesians,2,17,He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
Ephesians,2,18,For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
Ephesians,2,19,"Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household,"
Ephesians,2,20,"built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."
Ephesians,2,21,In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
Ephesians,2,22,And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—"
Ephesians,3,2,"Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you,"
Ephesians,3,3,"that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly."
Ephesians,3,4,"In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,"
Ephesians,3,5,which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.
Ephesians,3,6,"This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus."
Ephesians,3,7,I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of his power.
Ephesians,3,8,"Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ,"
Ephesians,3,9,"and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things."
Ephesians,3,10,"His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,"
Ephesians,3,11,according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Ephesians,3,12,In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
Ephesians,3,13,"I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,"For this reason I kneel before the Father,"
Ephesians,3,15,from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
Ephesians,3,16,"I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,"
Ephesians,3,17,"so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,"
Ephesians,3,18,"may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,"
Ephesians,3,19,and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
Ephesians,3,20,"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,"
Ephesians,3,21,"to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen."
Ephesians,4,1,"As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received."
Ephesians,4,2,"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love."
Ephesians,4,3,Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called;"
Ephesians,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism;"
Ephesians,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
Ephesians,4,7,But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
Ephesians,4,8,"This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,"
Ephesians,4,12,"to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up"
Ephesians,4,13,"until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."
Ephesians,4,14,"Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming."
Ephesians,4,15,"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ."
Ephesians,4,16,"From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."
Ephesians,4,17,"So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking."
Ephesians,4,18,They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
Ephesians,4,19,"Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed."
Ephesians,4,20,"That, however, is not the way of life you learned"
Ephesians,4,21,when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
Ephesians,4,22,"You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;"
Ephesians,4,23,to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
Ephesians,4,24,"and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."
Ephesians,4,25,"Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body."
Ephesians,4,26,"“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,"
Ephesians,4,27,and do not give the devil a foothold.
Ephesians,4,28,"Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need."
Ephesians,4,29,"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen."
Ephesians,4,30,"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice."
Ephesians,4,32,"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children"
Ephesians,5,2,"and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."
Ephesians,5,3,"But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people."
Ephesians,5,4,"Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving."
Ephesians,5,5,"For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient."
Ephesians,5,7,Therefore do not be partners with them.
Ephesians,5,8,"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light"
Ephesians,5,9,"(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)"
Ephesians,5,10,and find out what pleases the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them."
Ephesians,5,12,It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.
Ephesians,5,14,"This is why it is said: “Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”"
Ephesians,5,15,"Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise,"
Ephesians,5,16,"making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is."
Ephesians,5,18,"Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit,"
Ephesians,5,19,"speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord,"
Ephesians,5,20,"always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,5,21,Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior."
Ephesians,5,24,"Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her"
Ephesians,5,26,"to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,"
Ephesians,5,27,"and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless."
Ephesians,5,28,"In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself."
Ephesians,5,29,"After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—"
Ephesians,5,30,for we are members of his body.
Ephesians,5,31,"“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”"
Ephesians,5,32,This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.
Ephesians,5,33,"However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,“Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise—
Ephesians,6,3,“so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”
Ephesians,6,4,"Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ."
Ephesians,6,6,"Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart."
Ephesians,6,7,"Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,"
Ephesians,6,8,"because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes."
Ephesians,6,12,"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."
Ephesians,6,13,"Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,"
Ephesians,6,15,and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
Ephesians,6,16,"In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
Ephesians,6,17,"Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
Ephesians,6,18,"And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people."
Ephesians,6,19,"Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,"
Ephesians,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should."
Ephesians,6,21,"Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing."
Ephesians,6,22,"I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all God’s holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:"
Philippians,1,2,Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians,1,3,I thank my God every time I remember you.
Philippians,1,4,"In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy"
Philippians,1,5,"because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,"
Philippians,1,6,"being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."
Philippians,1,7,"It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me."
Philippians,1,8,God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
Philippians,1,9,"And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,"
Philippians,1,10,"so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,"
Philippians,1,11,filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.
Philippians,1,12,"Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel."
Philippians,1,13,"As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ."
Philippians,1,14,"And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear."
Philippians,1,15,"It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill."
Philippians,1,16,"The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel."
Philippians,1,17,"The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains."
Philippians,1,18,"But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,"
Philippians,1,19,for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
Philippians,1,20,"I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
Philippians,1,21,"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
Philippians,1,22,"If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!"
Philippians,1,23,"I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;"
Philippians,1,24,but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
Philippians,1,25,"Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,"
Philippians,1,26,so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.
Philippians,1,27,"Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel"
Philippians,1,28,"without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God."
Philippians,1,29,"For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,"
Philippians,1,30,"since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have."
Philippians,2,1,"Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,"
Philippians,2,2,"then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind."
Philippians,2,3,"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,"
Philippians,2,4,not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
Philippians,2,5,"In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:"
Philippians,2,6,"Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;"
Philippians,2,7,"rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness."
Philippians,2,8,"And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross!"
Philippians,2,9,"Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,"
Philippians,2,10,"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,"
Philippians,2,11,"and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
Philippians,2,12,"Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,"
Philippians,2,13,for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.
Philippians,2,14,"Do everything without grumbling or arguing,"
Philippians,2,15,"so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky"
Philippians,2,16,as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.
Philippians,2,17,"But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you."
Philippians,2,18,So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
Philippians,2,19,"I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you."
Philippians,2,20,"I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare."
Philippians,2,21,"For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ."
Philippians,2,22,"But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel."
Philippians,2,23,"I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me."
Philippians,2,24,And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
Philippians,2,25,"But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs."
Philippians,2,26,For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
Philippians,2,27,"Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow."
Philippians,2,28,"Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety."
Philippians,2,29,"So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,"
Philippians,2,30,because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.
Philippians,3,1,"Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you."
Philippians,3,2,"Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh."
Philippians,3,3,"For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—"
Philippians,3,4,"though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:"
Philippians,3,5,"circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;"
Philippians,3,6,"as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless."
Philippians,3,7,But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
Philippians,3,8,"What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ"
Philippians,3,9,"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith."
Philippians,3,10,"I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,"
Philippians,3,11,"and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead."
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me."
Philippians,3,13,"Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,"
Philippians,3,14,I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,3,15,"All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you."
Philippians,3,16,Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
Philippians,3,17,"Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do."
Philippians,3,18,"For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ."
Philippians,3,19,"Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things."
Philippians,3,20,"But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,"
Philippians,3,21,"who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!"
Philippians,4,2,I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
Philippians,4,3,"Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
Philippians,4,5,Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
Philippians,4,6,"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."
Philippians,4,7,"And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things."
Philippians,4,9,"Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you."
Philippians,4,10,"I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it."
Philippians,4,11,"I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances."
Philippians,4,12,"I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."
Philippians,4,13,I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
Philippians,4,14,Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.
Philippians,4,15,"Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;"
Philippians,4,16,"for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need."
Philippians,4,17,Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account.
Philippians,4,18,"I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God."
Philippians,4,19,And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,20,To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings.
Philippians,4,22,"All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household."
Philippians,4,23,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Colossians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
Colossians,1,2,"To God’s holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father."
Colossians,1,3,"We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,"
Colossians,1,4,because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God’s people—
Colossians,1,5,the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel
Colossians,1,6,"that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God’s grace."
Colossians,1,7,"You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,"
Colossians,1,8,and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
Colossians,1,9,"For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,"
Colossians,1,10,"so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,"
Colossians,1,11,"being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,"
Colossians,1,12,"and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light."
Colossians,1,13,"For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,"
Colossians,1,14,"in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
Colossians,1,15,"The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
Colossians,1,16,"For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him."
Colossians,1,17,"He is before all things, and in him all things hold together."
Colossians,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy."
Colossians,1,19,"For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,"
Colossians,1,20,"and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross."
Colossians,1,21,Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
Colossians,1,22,"But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—"
Colossians,1,23,"if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant."
Colossians,1,24,"Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church."
Colossians,1,25,I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness—
Colossians,1,26,"the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people."
Colossians,1,27,"To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
Colossians,1,28,"He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ."
Colossians,1,29,To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.
Colossians,2,1,"I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally."
Colossians,2,2,"My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,"
Colossians,2,3,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians,2,4,I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.
Colossians,2,5,"For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is."
Colossians,2,6,"So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him,"
Colossians,2,7,"rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness."
Colossians,2,8,"See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ."
Colossians,2,9,"For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,"
Colossians,2,10,and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority.
Colossians,2,11,"In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ,"
Colossians,2,12,"having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead."
Colossians,2,13,"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,"
Colossians,2,14,"having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross."
Colossians,2,15,"And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."
Colossians,2,16,"Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day."
Colossians,2,17,"These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ."
Colossians,2,18,Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind.
Colossians,2,19,"They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow."
Colossians,2,20,"Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules:"
Colossians,2,21,“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”?
Colossians,2,22,"These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on merely human commands and teachings."
Colossians,2,23,"Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence."
Colossians,3,1,"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."
Colossians,3,2,"Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."
Colossians,3,3,"For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God."
Colossians,3,4,"When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry."
Colossians,3,6,"Because of these, the wrath of God is coming."
Colossians,3,7,"You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived."
Colossians,3,8,"But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips."
Colossians,3,9,"Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices"
Colossians,3,10,"and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."
Colossians,3,11,"Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all."
Colossians,3,12,"Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience."
Colossians,3,13,Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
Colossians,3,14,"And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."
Colossians,3,15,"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful."
Colossians,3,16,"Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts."
Colossians,3,17,"And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."
Colossians,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
Colossians,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them."
Colossians,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Colossians,3,21,"Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged."
Colossians,3,22,"Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord."
Colossians,3,23,"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters,"
Colossians,3,24,since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
Colossians,3,25,"Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism."
Colossians,4,1,"Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven."
Colossians,4,2,"Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful."
Colossians,4,3,"And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains."
Colossians,4,4,"Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should."
Colossians,4,5,Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.
Colossians,4,6,"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone."
Colossians,4,7,"Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord."
Colossians,4,8,I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
Colossians,4,9,"He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here."
Colossians,4,10,"My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)"
Colossians,4,11,"Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me."
Colossians,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured."
Colossians,4,13,I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.
Colossians,4,14,"Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings."
Colossians,4,15,"Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house."
Colossians,4,16,"After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea."
Colossians,4,17,Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”
Colossians,4,18,"I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you."
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers.
1 Thessalonians,1,3,"We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you,"
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake."
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,1,7,And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it,"
1 Thessalonians,1,9,"for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,"
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results."
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,"For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you."
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please people but God, who tests our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed—God is our witness."
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"Instead, we were like young children among you. Just as a nursing mother cares for her children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,"You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed."
1 Thessalonians,2,11,"For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,12,"encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory."
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews"
1 Thessalonians,2,15,who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone
1 Thessalonians,2,16,in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but Satan blocked our way."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,"Indeed, you are our glory and joy."
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens."
1 Thessalonians,3,2,"We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,"
1 Thessalonians,3,3,so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you."
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith."
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?
1 Thessalonians,3,10,Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
1 Thessalonians,3,11,Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.
1 Thessalonians,3,12,"May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you."
1 Thessalonians,3,13,May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;
1 Thessalonians,4,4,"that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,"
1 Thessalonians,4,5,"not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;"
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,"For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life."
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,"Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other."
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,"
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you,"
1 Thessalonians,4,12,so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."
1 Thessalonians,4,17,"After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Therefore encourage one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,"
1 Thessalonians,5,2,for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape."
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,"For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night."
1 Thessalonians,5,8,"But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet."
1 Thessalonians,5,9,For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you."
1 Thessalonians,5,13,Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,"Rejoice always,"
1 Thessalonians,5,17,"pray continually,"
1 Thessalonians,5,18,give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Do not quench the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians,5,20,Do not treat prophecies with contempt
1 Thessalonians,5,21,"but test them all; hold on to what is good,"
1 Thessalonians,5,22,reject every kind of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,"May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brothers and sisters, pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all God’s people with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love all of you have for one another is increasing."
2 Thessalonians,1,4,"Therefore, among God’s churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring."
2 Thessalonians,1,5,"All this is evidence that God’s judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering."
2 Thessalonians,1,6,God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels."
2 Thessalonians,1,8,He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
2 Thessalonians,1,9,They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith."
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come.
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction."
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?
2 Thessalonians,2,6,"And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time."
2 Thessalonians,2,7,For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming."
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
2 Thessalonians,2,11,For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
2 Thessalonians,2,12,and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth."
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you."
2 Thessalonians,3,2,"And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not everyone has faith."
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.
2 Thessalonians,3,5,May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you."
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”"
2 Thessalonians,3,11,We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies.
2 Thessalonians,3,12,Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat.
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,"
1 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer"
1 Timothy,1,4,or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by faith.
1 Timothy,1,5,"The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
1 Timothy,1,6,Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk.
1 Timothy,1,7,"They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm."
1 Timothy,1,8,We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
1 Timothy,1,9,"We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,"
1 Timothy,1,10,"for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine"
1 Timothy,1,11,"that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me."
1 Timothy,1,12,"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service."
1 Timothy,1,13,"Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief."
1 Timothy,1,14,"The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,1,15,Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
1 Timothy,1,16,"But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well,"
1 Timothy,1,19,"holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith."
1 Timothy,1,20,"Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—"
1 Timothy,2,2,"for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness."
1 Timothy,2,3,"This is good, and pleases God our Savior,"
1 Timothy,2,4,who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,"
1 Timothy,2,6,who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time.
1 Timothy,2,7,"And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles."
1 Timothy,2,8,"Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing."
1 Timothy,2,9,"I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,"
1 Timothy,2,10,"but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God."
1 Timothy,2,11,A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
1 Timothy,2,12,I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
1 Timothy,2,15,"But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task.
1 Timothy,3,2,"Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,"
1 Timothy,3,3,"not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money."
1 Timothy,3,4,"He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect."
1 Timothy,3,5,"(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap."
1 Timothy,3,8,"In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain."
1 Timothy,3,9,They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,"They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons."
1 Timothy,3,11,"In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything."
1 Timothy,3,12,A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.
1 Timothy,3,13,Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,"Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,"
1 Timothy,3,15,"if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
1 Timothy,4,2,"Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron."
1 Timothy,4,3,"They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth."
1 Timothy,4,4,"For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,"
1 Timothy,4,5,because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed."
1 Timothy,4,7,"Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly."
1 Timothy,4,8,"For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
1 Timothy,4,10,"That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress."
1 Timothy,4,16,"Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,"
1 Timothy,5,2,"older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God."
1 Timothy,5,5,The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.
1 Timothy,5,6,But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame."
1 Timothy,5,8,"Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband,"
1 Timothy,5,10,"and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds."
1 Timothy,5,11,"As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry."
1 Timothy,5,12,"Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge."
1 Timothy,5,13,"Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to."
1 Timothy,5,14,"So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander."
1 Timothy,5,15,Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need."
1 Timothy,5,17,"The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and “The worker deserves his wages.”"
1 Timothy,5,19,Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy,5,20,"But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses."
1 Timothy,5,24,"The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them."
1 Timothy,5,25,"In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever."
1 Timothy,6,1,"All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered."
1 Timothy,6,2,These are the things you are to teach and insist on.
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching,"
1 Timothy,6,4,"they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions"
1 Timothy,6,5,"and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain."
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it."
1 Timothy,6,8,"But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that."
1 Timothy,6,9,Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness."
1 Timothy,6,12,Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
1 Timothy,6,13,"In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you"
1 Timothy,6,14,"to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Timothy,6,15,"which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"
1 Timothy,6,16,"who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment."
1 Timothy,6,18,"Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share."
1 Timothy,6,19,"In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,"
1 Timothy,6,21,which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith. Grace be with you all.
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers."
2 Timothy,1,4,"Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy."
2 Timothy,1,5,"I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also."
2 Timothy,1,6,"For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands."
2 Timothy,1,7,"For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline."
2 Timothy,1,8,"So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God."
2 Timothy,1,9,"He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,"
2 Timothy,1,10,"but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."
2 Timothy,1,11,And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.
2 Timothy,1,12,"That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
2 Timothy,1,15,"You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains."
2 Timothy,1,17,"On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me."
2 Timothy,1,18,May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.
2 Timothy,2,3,"Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,4,"No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer."
2 Timothy,2,5,"Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according to the rules."
2 Timothy,2,6,The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
2 Timothy,2,7,"Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,"
2 Timothy,2,9,for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained.
2 Timothy,2,10,"Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;"
2 Timothy,2,12,"if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;"
2 Timothy,2,13,"if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly."
2 Timothy,2,17,"Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,"
2 Timothy,2,18,"who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,"In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use."
2 Timothy,2,21,"Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels."
2 Timothy,2,24,"And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful."
2 Timothy,2,25,"Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,"
2 Timothy,2,26,"and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.
2 Timothy,3,2,"People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,"
2 Timothy,3,4,"treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—"
2 Timothy,3,5,having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.
2 Timothy,3,6,"They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,"
2 Timothy,3,7,always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone."
2 Timothy,3,10,"You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,"
2 Timothy,3,11,"persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them."
2 Timothy,3,12,"In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,"
2 Timothy,3,13,"while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,"
2 Timothy,3,15,"and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,3,16,"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,"
2 Timothy,3,17,so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
2 Timothy,4,1,"In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:"
2 Timothy,4,2,"Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear."
2 Timothy,4,4,They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
2 Timothy,4,5,"But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near."
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."
2 Timothy,4,8,"Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,"Do your best to come to me quickly,"
2 Timothy,4,10,"for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry."
2 Timothy,4,12,I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
2 Timothy,4,15,"You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message."
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion’s mouth."
2 Timothy,4,18,The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy,4,19,Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus."
2 Timothy,4,21,"Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
Titus,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—"
Titus,1,2,"in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,"
Titus,1,3,"and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,"
Titus,1,4,"To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior."
Titus,1,5,"The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you."
Titus,1,6,"An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient."
Titus,1,7,"Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain."
Titus,1,8,"Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined."
Titus,1,9,"He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it."
Titus,1,10,"For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group."
Titus,1,11,"They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain."
Titus,1,12,"One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”"
Titus,1,13,"This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith"
Titus,1,14,and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth.
Titus,1,15,"To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted."
Titus,1,16,"They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good."
Titus,2,1,"You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine."
Titus,2,2,"Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance."
Titus,2,3,"Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good."
Titus,2,4,"Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children,"
Titus,2,5,"to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God."
Titus,2,6,"Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled."
Titus,2,7,"In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness"
Titus,2,8,"and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us."
Titus,2,9,"Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,"
Titus,2,10,"and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive."
Titus,2,11,For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
Titus,2,12,"It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,"
Titus,2,13,"while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,"
Titus,2,14,"who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good."
Titus,2,15,"These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you."
Titus,3,1,"Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,"
Titus,3,2,"to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone."
Titus,3,3,"At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another."
Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,"
Titus,3,6,"whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
Titus,3,7,"so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life."
Titus,3,8,"This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless."
Titus,3,10,"Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them."
Titus,3,11,You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
Titus,3,12,"As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there."
Titus,3,13,Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.
Titus,3,14,"Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives."
Titus,3,15,Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Philemon,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—"
Philemon,1,2,also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:
Philemon,1,3,Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon,1,4,"I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,"
Philemon,1,5,because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus.
Philemon,1,6,I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.
Philemon,1,7,"Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people."
Philemon,1,8,"Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,"
Philemon,1,9,yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—
Philemon,1,10,"that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains."
Philemon,1,11,"Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me."
Philemon,1,12,I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.
Philemon,1,13,I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
Philemon,1,14,"But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary."
Philemon,1,15,Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—
Philemon,1,16,"no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord."
Philemon,1,17,"So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me."
Philemon,1,18,"If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me."
Philemon,1,19,"I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self."
Philemon,1,20,"I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ."
Philemon,1,21,"Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask."
Philemon,1,22,"And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers."
Philemon,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings."
Philemon,1,24,"And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers."
Philemon,1,25,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Hebrews,1,1,"In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways,"
Hebrews,1,2,"but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe."
Hebrews,1,3,"The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."
Hebrews,1,4,So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.”"
Hebrews,1,7,"In speaking of the angels he says, “He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire.”"
Hebrews,1,8,"But about the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom."
Hebrews,1,9,"You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.”"
Hebrews,1,10,"He also says, “In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands."
Hebrews,1,11,"They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment."
Hebrews,1,12,"You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.”"
Hebrews,1,13,"To which of the angels did God ever say, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?"
Hebrews,1,14,Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
Hebrews,2,1,"We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away."
Hebrews,2,2,"For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,"
Hebrews,2,3,"how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him."
Hebrews,2,4,"God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will."
Hebrews,2,5,"It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking."
Hebrews,2,6,"But there is a place where someone has testified: “What is mankind that you are mindful of them, a son of man that you care for him?"
Hebrews,2,7,You made them a little lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and honor
Hebrews,2,8,"and put everything under their feet.” In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone."
Hebrews,2,10,"In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered."
Hebrews,2,11,Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
Hebrews,2,12,"He says, “I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises.”"
Hebrews,2,13,"And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again he says, “Here am I, and the children God has given me.”"
Hebrews,2,14,"Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—"
Hebrews,2,15,and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
Hebrews,2,16,"For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants."
Hebrews,2,17,"For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest."
Hebrews,3,2,"He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house."
Hebrews,3,3,"Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself."
Hebrews,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything."
Hebrews,3,5,"“Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,” bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future."
Hebrews,3,6,"But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory."
Hebrews,3,7,"So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice,"
Hebrews,3,8,"do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness,"
Hebrews,3,9,"where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did."
Hebrews,3,10,"That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.’"
Hebrews,3,11,"So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”"
Hebrews,3,12,"See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God."
Hebrews,3,13,"But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness."
Hebrews,3,14,"We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end."
Hebrews,3,15,"As has just been said: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.”"
Hebrews,3,16,Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?
Hebrews,3,17,"And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?
Hebrews,3,19,"So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief."
Hebrews,4,1,"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed."
Hebrews,4,3,"Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, “So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’” And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”
Hebrews,4,5,"And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.”"
Hebrews,4,6,"Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience,"
Hebrews,4,7,"God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”"
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day."
Hebrews,4,9,"There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;"
Hebrews,4,10,"for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his."
Hebrews,4,11,"Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
Hebrews,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins."
Hebrews,5,2,"He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness."
Hebrews,5,3,"This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,5,4,"And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father.”"
Hebrews,5,6,"And he says in another place, “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,5,7,"During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission."
Hebrews,5,8,"Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered"
Hebrews,5,9,"and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him"
Hebrews,5,10,and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,11,"We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand."
Hebrews,5,12,"In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!"
Hebrews,5,13,"Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness."
Hebrews,5,14,"But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,"
Hebrews,6,2,"instruction about cleansing rites, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,"And God permitting, we will do so."
Hebrews,6,4,"It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,"
Hebrews,6,5,who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age
Hebrews,6,6,"and who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace."
Hebrews,6,7,Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.
Hebrews,6,8,But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
Hebrews,6,9,"Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation."
Hebrews,6,10,God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
Hebrews,6,11,"We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized."
Hebrews,6,12,"We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised."
Hebrews,6,13,"When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,"
Hebrews,6,14,"saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”"
Hebrews,6,15,"And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised."
Hebrews,6,16,"People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument."
Hebrews,6,17,"Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath."
Hebrews,6,18,"God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged."
Hebrews,6,19,"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,"
Hebrews,6,20,"where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,"
Hebrews,7,2,"and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.”"
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever."
Hebrews,7,4,Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!
Hebrews,7,5,"Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham."
Hebrews,7,6,"This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises."
Hebrews,7,7,And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Hebrews,7,8,"In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living."
Hebrews,7,9,"One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,"
Hebrews,7,10,"because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor."
Hebrews,7,11,"If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also."
Hebrews,7,13,"He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests."
Hebrews,7,15,"And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,"
Hebrews,7,16,one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.
Hebrews,7,17,"For it is declared: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,7,18,The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
Hebrews,7,19,"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God."
Hebrews,7,20,"And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,"
Hebrews,7,21,but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’”
Hebrews,7,22,"Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,"Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;"
Hebrews,7,24,"but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens."
Hebrews,7,27,"Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,"
Hebrews,8,2,"and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being."
Hebrews,8,3,"Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer."
Hebrews,8,4,"If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law."
Hebrews,8,5,They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”
Hebrews,8,6,"But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another."
Hebrews,8,8,"But God found fault with the people and said: “The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah."
Hebrews,8,9,"It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Hebrews,8,11,"No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
Hebrews,8,13,"By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear."
Hebrews,9,1,Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.
Hebrews,9,2,A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.
Hebrews,9,3,"Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,"
Hebrews,9,4,"which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant."
Hebrews,9,5,"Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now."
Hebrews,9,6,"When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry."
Hebrews,9,7,"But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance."
Hebrews,9,8,The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning.
Hebrews,9,9,"This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper."
Hebrews,9,10,They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
Hebrews,9,11,"But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation."
Hebrews,9,12,"He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
Hebrews,9,14,"How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!"
Hebrews,9,15,"For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant."
Hebrews,9,16,"In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,"
Hebrews,9,17,because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.
Hebrews,9,18,This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people."
Hebrews,9,20,"He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”"
Hebrews,9,21,"In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies."
Hebrews,9,22,"In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
Hebrews,9,23,"It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence."
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own."
Hebrews,9,26,Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews,9,27,"Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,"
Hebrews,9,28,"so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him."
Hebrews,10,1,"The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship."
Hebrews,10,2,"Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins."
Hebrews,10,3,But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins.
Hebrews,10,4,It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;"
Hebrews,10,6,with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll— I have come to do your will, my God.’”"
Hebrews,10,8,"First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”—though they were offered in accordance with the law."
Hebrews,10,9,"Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,"And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
Hebrews,10,11,"Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins."
Hebrews,10,12,"But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,"
Hebrews,10,13,and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
Hebrews,10,15,The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:
Hebrews,10,16,"“This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.”"
Hebrews,10,17,Then he adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.”
Hebrews,10,18,"And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary."
Hebrews,10,19,"Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,"
Hebrews,10,20,"by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,"
Hebrews,10,21,"and since we have a great priest over the house of God,"
Hebrews,10,22,"let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,"Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful."
Hebrews,10,24,"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,"
Hebrews,10,25,"not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."
Hebrews,10,26,"If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,"
Hebrews,10,27,but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
Hebrews,10,28,Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews,10,29,"How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”"
Hebrews,10,31,It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,"Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering."
Hebrews,10,33,Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
Hebrews,10,34,"You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions."
Hebrews,10,35,So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
Hebrews,10,36,"You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised."
Hebrews,10,37,"For, “In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.”"
Hebrews,10,38,"And, “But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.”"
Hebrews,10,39,"But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved."
Hebrews,11,1,Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.
Hebrews,11,2,This is what the ancients were commended for.
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead."
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God."
Hebrews,11,6,"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going."
Hebrews,11,9,"By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise."
Hebrews,11,10,"For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God."
Hebrews,11,11,"And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise."
Hebrews,11,12,"And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore."
Hebrews,11,13,"All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth."
Hebrews,11,14,People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
Hebrews,11,15,"If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return."
Hebrews,11,16,"Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,"
Hebrews,11,18,"even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”"
Hebrews,11,19,"Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death."
Hebrews,11,20,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff."
Hebrews,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones."
Hebrews,11,23,"By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict."
Hebrews,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter."
Hebrews,11,25,He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
Hebrews,11,26,"He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward."
Hebrews,11,27,"By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible."
Hebrews,11,28,"By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel."
Hebrews,11,29,"By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned."
Hebrews,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days."
Hebrews,11,31,"By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient."
Hebrews,11,32,"And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets,"
Hebrews,11,33,"who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,"
Hebrews,11,34,"quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection."
Hebrews,11,36,"Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment."
Hebrews,11,37,"They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated—"
Hebrews,11,38,"the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground."
Hebrews,11,39,"These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised,"
Hebrews,11,40,since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,"
Hebrews,12,2,"fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."
Hebrews,12,4,"In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood."
Hebrews,12,5,"And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says, “My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,"
Hebrews,12,6,"because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”"
Hebrews,12,7,Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father?
Hebrews,12,8,"If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all."
Hebrews,12,9,"Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!"
Hebrews,12,10,"They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness."
Hebrews,12,11,"No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it."
Hebrews,12,12,"Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees."
Hebrews,12,13,"“Make level paths for your feet,” so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed."
Hebrews,12,14,Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.
Hebrews,12,15,See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
Hebrews,12,16,"See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son."
Hebrews,12,17,"Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done."
Hebrews,12,18,"You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;"
Hebrews,12,19,"to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,"
Hebrews,12,20,"because they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”"
Hebrews,12,21,"The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”"
Hebrews,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly,"
Hebrews,12,23,"to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,"
Hebrews,12,24,"to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?"
Hebrews,12,26,"At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”"
Hebrews,12,27,"The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain."
Hebrews,12,28,"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,"
Hebrews,12,29,for our “God is a consuming fire.”
Hebrews,13,1,Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.
Hebrews,13,2,"Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it."
Hebrews,13,3,"Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering."
Hebrews,13,4,"Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."
Hebrews,13,5,"Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.”"
Hebrews,13,6,"So we say with confidence, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?”"
Hebrews,13,7,"Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith."
Hebrews,13,8,Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Hebrews,13,9,"Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so."
Hebrews,13,10,We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews,13,11,"The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp."
Hebrews,13,12,And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.
Hebrews,13,13,"Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore."
Hebrews,13,14,"For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come."
Hebrews,13,15,"Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name."
Hebrews,13,16,"And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."
Hebrews,13,17,"Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you."
Hebrews,13,18,Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
Hebrews,13,19,I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
Hebrews,13,20,"Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,"
Hebrews,13,21,"equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
Hebrews,13,22,"Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly."
Hebrews,13,23,"I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you."
Hebrews,13,24,Greet all your leaders and all the Lord’s people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
Hebrews,13,25,Grace be with you all.
James,1,1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings."
James,1,2,"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,"
James,1,3,because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
James,1,4,"Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."
James,1,5,"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."
James,1,6,"But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind."
James,1,7,That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
James,1,8,Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.
James,1,9,Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position.
James,1,10,But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wild flower.
James,1,11,"For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business."
James,1,12,"Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him."
James,1,13,"When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;"
James,1,14,but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.
James,1,15,"Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."
James,1,16,"Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters."
James,1,17,"Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."
James,1,18,"He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created."
James,1,19,"My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,"
James,1,20,because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
James,1,21,"Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you."
James,1,22,"Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."
James,1,23,Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror
James,1,24,"and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like."
James,1,25,"But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do."
James,1,26,"Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless."
James,1,27,Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
James,2,1,"My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism."
James,2,2,"Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in."
James,2,3,"If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,”"
James,2,4,have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
James,2,5,"Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?"
James,2,6,But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
James,2,7,Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?
James,2,8,"If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right."
James,2,9,"But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers."
James,2,10,For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
James,2,11,"For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker."
James,2,12,"Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,"
James,2,13,because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
James,2,14,"What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?"
James,2,15,Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.
James,2,16,"If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?"
James,2,17,"In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."
James,2,18,"But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds."
James,2,19,You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
James,2,20,"You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?"
James,2,21,Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
James,2,22,"You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did."
James,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called God’s friend."
James,2,24,You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.
James,2,25,"In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?"
James,2,26,"As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead."
James,3,1,"Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly."
James,3,2,"We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check."
James,3,3,"When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal."
James,3,4,"Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go."
James,3,5,"Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark."
James,3,6,"The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell."
James,3,7,"All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind,"
James,3,8,"but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison."
James,3,9,"With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God’s likeness."
James,3,10,"Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be."
James,3,11,Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
James,3,12,"My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water."
James,3,13,"Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom."
James,3,14,"But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth."
James,3,15,"Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic."
James,3,16,"For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere."
James,3,18,Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
James,4,1,What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you?
James,4,2,"You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God."
James,4,3,"When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures."
James,4,4,"You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God."
James,4,5,Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us?
James,4,6,But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”
James,4,7,"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
James,4,8,"Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
James,4,9,"Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom."
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up."
James,4,11,"Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it."
James,4,12,"There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?"
James,4,13,"Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”"
James,4,14,"Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."
James,4,15,"Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”"
James,4,16,"As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil."
James,4,17,"If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them."
James,5,1,"Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you."
James,5,2,"Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes."
James,5,3,Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
James,5,4,Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
James,5,5,You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
James,5,6,"You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you."
James,5,7,"Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains."
James,5,8,"You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near."
James,5,9,"Don’t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!"
James,5,10,"Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."
James,5,11,"As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy."
James,5,12,"Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple “Yes” or “No.” Otherwise you will be condemned."
James,5,13,Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise.
James,5,14,Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
James,5,15,"And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."
James,5,16,Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
James,5,17,"Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years."
James,5,18,"Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops."
James,5,19,"My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back,"
James,5,20,remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God’s elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,"
1 Peter,1,2,"who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance."
1 Peter,1,3,"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
1 Peter,1,4,"and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,"
1 Peter,1,5,who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials."
1 Peter,1,7,"These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed."
1 Peter,1,8,"Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,"
1 Peter,1,9,"for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,"
1 Peter,1,11,trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.
1 Peter,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things."
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming."
1 Peter,1,14,"As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance."
1 Peter,1,15,"But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;"
1 Peter,1,16,"for it is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”"
1 Peter,1,17,"Since you call on a Father who judges each person’s work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear."
1 Peter,1,18,"For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,"
1 Peter,1,19,"but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect."
1 Peter,1,20,"He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake."
1 Peter,1,21,"Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart."
1 Peter,1,23,"For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God."
1 Peter,1,24,"For, “All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,"
1 Peter,1,25,but the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that was preached to you.
1 Peter,2,1,"Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind."
1 Peter,2,2,"Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,"
1 Peter,2,3,now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
1 Peter,2,4,"As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him—"
1 Peter,2,5,"you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"For in Scripture it says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”"
1 Peter,2,7,"Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”"
1 Peter,2,8,"and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.” They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."
1 Peter,2,10,"Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul."
1 Peter,2,12,"Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us."
1 Peter,2,13,"Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority,"
1 Peter,2,14,"or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right."
1 Peter,2,15,For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
1 Peter,2,16,"Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves."
1 Peter,2,17,"Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor."
1 Peter,2,18,"Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh."
1 Peter,2,19,For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.
1 Peter,2,20,"But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God."
1 Peter,2,21,"To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps."
1 Peter,2,22,"“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”"
1 Peter,2,23,"When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly."
1 Peter,2,24,"“He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.”"
1 Peter,2,25,"For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,"
1 Peter,3,2,when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
1 Peter,3,3,"Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes."
1 Peter,3,4,"Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight."
1 Peter,3,5,"For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands,"
1 Peter,3,6,"like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear."
1 Peter,3,7,"Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers."
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble."
1 Peter,3,9,"Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech."
1 Peter,3,11,They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.
1 Peter,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”"
1 Peter,3,13,Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
1 Peter,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened.”"
1 Peter,3,15,"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,"
1 Peter,3,16,"keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander."
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit."
1 Peter,3,19,"After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits—"
1 Peter,3,20,"to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water,"
1 Peter,3,21,"and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
1 Peter,3,22,"who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin."
1 Peter,4,2,"As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God."
1 Peter,4,3,"For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry."
1 Peter,4,4,"They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you."
1 Peter,4,5,But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit."
1 Peter,4,7,The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.
1 Peter,4,8,"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins."
1 Peter,4,9,Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter,4,10,"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms."
1 Peter,4,11,"If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you."
1 Peter,4,13,"But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you."
1 Peter,4,15,"If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler."
1 Peter,4,16,"However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name."
1 Peter,4,17,"For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
1 Peter,4,18,"And, “If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”"
1 Peter,4,19,"So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good."
1 Peter,5,1,"To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed:"
1 Peter,5,2,"Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;"
1 Peter,5,3,"not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away."
1 Peter,5,5,"In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”"
1 Peter,5,6,"Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time."
1 Peter,5,7,Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
1 Peter,5,8,Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
1 Peter,5,9,"Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings."
1 Peter,5,10,"And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast."
1 Peter,5,11,To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it."
1 Peter,5,13,"She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark."
1 Peter,5,14,Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
2 Peter,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:"
2 Peter,1,2,Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2 Peter,1,3,His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
2 Peter,1,4,"Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires."
2 Peter,1,5,"For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;"
2 Peter,1,6,"and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;"
2 Peter,1,7,"and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love."
2 Peter,1,8,"For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,9,"But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins."
2 Peter,1,10,"Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble,"
2 Peter,1,11,and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 Peter,1,12,"So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have."
2 Peter,1,13,"I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,"
2 Peter,1,14,"because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me."
2 Peter,1,15,And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
2 Peter,1,16,"For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
2 Peter,1,17,"He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”"
2 Peter,1,18,We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
2 Peter,1,19,"We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."
2 Peter,1,20,"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things."
2 Peter,1,21,"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
2 Peter,2,1,"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves."
2 Peter,2,2,Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.
2 Peter,2,3,"In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;"
2 Peter,2,5,"if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;"
2 Peter,2,6,"if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,7,"and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless"
2 Peter,2,8,"(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—"
2 Peter,2,9,"if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment."
2 Peter,2,10,"This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings;"
2 Peter,2,11,"yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord."
2 Peter,2,12,"But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish."
2 Peter,2,13,"They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you."
2 Peter,2,14,"With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood!"
2 Peter,2,15,"They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer, who loved the wages of wickedness."
2 Peter,2,16,But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
2 Peter,2,17,These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
2 Peter,2,18,"For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error."
2 Peter,2,19,"They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for “people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.”"
2 Peter,2,20,"If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning."
2 Peter,2,21,"It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them."
2 Peter,2,22,"Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.”"
2 Peter,3,1,"Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking."
2 Peter,3,2,I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
2 Peter,3,3,"Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires."
2 Peter,3,4,"They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”"
2 Peter,3,5,But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
2 Peter,3,6,By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
2 Peter,3,7,"By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly."
2 Peter,3,8,"But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare."
2 Peter,3,11,"Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives"
2 Peter,3,12,"as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat."
2 Peter,3,13,"But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells."
2 Peter,3,14,"So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him."
2 Peter,3,15,"Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him."
2 Peter,3,16,"He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction."
2 Peter,3,17,"Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position."
2 Peter,3,18,But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
1 John,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life."
1 John,1,2,"The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us."
1 John,1,3,"We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,We write this to make our joy complete.
1 John,1,5,This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.
1 John,1,6,"If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth."
1 John,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One."
1 John,2,2,"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."
1 John,2,3,We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands.
1 John,2,4,"Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person."
1 John,2,5,"But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him:"
1 John,2,6,Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.
1 John,2,7,"Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard."
1 John,2,8,"Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining."
1 John,2,9,Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness.
1 John,2,10,"Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble."
1 John,2,11,"But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them."
1 John,2,12,"I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name."
1 John,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one."
1 John,2,14,"I write to you, dear children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one."
1 John,2,15,"Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them."
1 John,2,16,"For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world."
1 John,2,17,"The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever."
1 John,2,18,"Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us."
1 John,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth."
1 John,2,21,"I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth."
1 John,2,22,Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son.
1 John,2,23,No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
1 John,2,24,"As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,And this is what he promised us—eternal life.
1 John,2,26,I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.
1 John,2,27,"As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him."
1 John,2,28,"And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming."
1 John,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him."
1 John,3,1,"See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him."
1 John,3,2,"Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."
1 John,3,3,"All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure."
1 John,3,4,"Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness."
1 John,3,5,But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.
1 John,3,6,No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
1 John,3,7,"Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous."
1 John,3,8,"The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work."
1 John,3,9,"No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God."
1 John,3,10,"This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister."
1 John,3,11,For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another.
1 John,3,12,"Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you."
1 John,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death."
1 John,3,15,"Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him."
1 John,3,16,This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
1 John,3,17,"If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?"
1 John,3,18,"Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth."
1 John,3,19,This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:
1 John,3,20,"If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything."
1 John,3,21,"Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God"
1 John,3,22,"and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him."
1 John,3,23,"And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us."
1 John,3,24,"The one who keeps God’s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us."
1 John,4,1,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,"This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,"
1 John,4,3,"but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world."
1 John,4,4,"You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them."
1 John,4,6,"We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood."
1 John,4,7,"Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God."
1 John,4,8,"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."
1 John,4,9,This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
1 John,4,10,"This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us."
1 John,4,13,This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit.
1 John,4,14,And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
1 John,4,15,"If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God."
1 John,4,16,"And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them."
1 John,4,17,This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.
1 John,4,18,"There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love."
1 John,4,19,We love because he first loved us.
1 John,4,20,"Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen."
1 John,4,21,And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.
1 John,5,1,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well."
1 John,5,2,This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.
1 John,5,3,"In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,"
1 John,5,4,"for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith."
1 John,5,5,Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
1 John,5,6,"This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth."
1 John,5,7,For there are three that testify:
1 John,5,8,"the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement."
1 John,5,9,"We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son."
1 John,5,10,"Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son."
1 John,5,11,"And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
1 John,5,12,Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1 John,5,13,I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
1 John,5,14,"This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us."
1 John,5,15,And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.
1 John,5,16,"If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that."
1 John,5,17,"All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death."
1 John,5,18,"We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them."
1 John,5,19,"We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one."
1 John,5,20,"We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Dear children, keep yourselves from idols."
2 John,1,1,"The elder, To the lady chosen by God and to her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth—"
2 John,1,2,"because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:"
2 John,1,3,"Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love."
2 John,1,4,"It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us."
2 John,1,5,"And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,"And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love."
2 John,1,7,"I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist."
2 John,1,8,"Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully."
2 John,1,9,Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
2 John,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them."
2 John,1,11,Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.
2 John,1,12,"I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete."
2 John,1,13,"The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send their greetings."
3 John,1,1,"The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
3 John,1,2,"Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well."
3 John,1,3,"It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it."
3 John,1,4,I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
3 John,1,5,"Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to you."
3 John,1,6,They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God.
3 John,1,7,"It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans."
3 John,1,8,We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth.
3 John,1,9,"I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us."
3 John,1,10,"So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church."
3 John,1,11,"Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true."
3 John,1,13,"I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink."
3 John,1,14,"I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name."
Jude,1,1,"Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:"
Jude,1,2,"Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance."
Jude,1,3,"Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people."
Jude,1,4,"For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord."
Jude,1,5,"Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe."
Jude,1,6,"And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day."
Jude,1,7,"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire."
Jude,1,8,"In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings."
Jude,1,9,"But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”"
Jude,1,10,"Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them."
Jude,1,11,Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.
Jude,1,12,"These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead."
Jude,1,13,"They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever."
Jude,1,14,"Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones"
Jude,1,15,"to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”"
Jude,1,16,These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
Jude,1,17,"But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold."
Jude,1,18,"They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.”"
Jude,1,19,"These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit."
Jude,1,20,"But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,"
Jude,1,21,keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
Jude,1,22,Be merciful to those who doubt;
Jude,1,23,"save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh."
Jude,1,24,To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy—
Jude,1,25,"to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen."
Revelation,1,1,"The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,"
Revelation,1,2,"who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ."
Revelation,1,3,"Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near."
Revelation,1,4,"John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,"
Revelation,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,"
Revelation,1,6,and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
Revelation,1,7,"“Look, he is coming with the clouds,” and “every eye will see him, even those who pierced him”; and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.” So shall it be! Amen."
Revelation,1,8,"“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”"
Revelation,1,9,"I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus."
Revelation,1,10,"On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,"
Revelation,1,11,"which said: “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”"
Revelation,1,12,"I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,"
Revelation,1,13,"and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest."
Revelation,1,14,"The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire."
Revelation,1,15,"His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters."
Revelation,1,16,"In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance."
Revelation,1,17,"When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last."
Revelation,1,18,"I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades."
Revelation,1,19,"“Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later."
Revelation,1,20,"The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
Revelation,2,1,“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
Revelation,2,2,"I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false."
Revelation,2,3,"You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary."
Revelation,2,4,Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.
Revelation,2,5,"Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place."
Revelation,2,6,"But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
Revelation,2,7,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."
Revelation,2,8,"“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again."
Revelation,2,9,"I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
Revelation,2,10,"Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown."
Revelation,2,11,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death."
Revelation,2,12,"“To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword."
Revelation,2,13,"I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives."
Revelation,2,14,"Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality."
Revelation,2,15,"Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans."
Revelation,2,16,"Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."
Revelation,2,17,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it."
Revelation,2,18,"“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze."
Revelation,2,19,"I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first."
Revelation,2,20,"Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols."
Revelation,2,21,"I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling."
Revelation,2,22,"So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways."
Revelation,2,23,"I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds."
Revelation,2,24,"Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose any other burden on you,"
Revelation,2,25,except to hold on to what you have until I come.’
Revelation,2,26,"To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations—"
Revelation,2,27,that one ‘will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery’—just as I have received authority from my Father.
Revelation,2,28,I will also give that one the morning star.
Revelation,2,29,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
Revelation,3,1,"“To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead."
Revelation,3,2,"Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God."
Revelation,3,3,"Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you."
Revelation,3,4,"Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy."
Revelation,3,5,"The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels."
Revelation,3,6,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
Revelation,3,7,"“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open."
Revelation,3,8,"I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name."
Revelation,3,9,"I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you."
Revelation,3,10,"Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth."
Revelation,3,11,"I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown."
Revelation,3,12,"The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name."
Revelation,3,13,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
Revelation,3,14,"“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation."
Revelation,3,15,"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!"
Revelation,3,16,"So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth."
Revelation,3,17,"You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked."
Revelation,3,18,"I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see."
Revelation,3,19,Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
Revelation,3,20,"Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me."
Revelation,3,21,"To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne."
Revelation,3,22,"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”"
Revelation,4,1,"After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”"
Revelation,4,2,"At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it."
Revelation,4,3,And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne.
Revelation,4,4,"Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads."
Revelation,4,5,"From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God."
Revelation,4,6,"Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back."
Revelation,4,7,"The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle."
Revelation,4,8,"Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: “‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come.”"
Revelation,4,9,"Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,"
Revelation,4,10,the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
Revelation,4,11,"“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”"
Revelation,5,1,Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
Revelation,5,2,"And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”"
Revelation,5,3,But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
Revelation,5,4,I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.
Revelation,5,5,"Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”"
Revelation,5,6,"Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth."
Revelation,5,7,He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,"And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people."
Revelation,5,9,"And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation."
Revelation,5,10,"You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”"
Revelation,5,11,"Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders."
Revelation,5,12,"In a loud voice they were saying: “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!”"
Revelation,5,13,"Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!”"
Revelation,5,14,"The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped."
Revelation,6,1,"I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”"
Revelation,6,2,"I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest."
Revelation,6,3,"When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”"
Revelation,6,4,"Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword."
Revelation,6,5,"When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand."
Revelation,6,6,"Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!”"
Revelation,6,7,"When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”"
Revelation,6,8,"I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth."
Revelation,6,9,"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained."
Revelation,6,10,"They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?”"
Revelation,6,11,"Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been."
Revelation,6,12,"I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,"
Revelation,6,13,"and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind."
Revelation,6,14,"The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place."
Revelation,6,15,"Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains."
Revelation,6,16,"They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!"
Revelation,6,17,"For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”"
Revelation,7,1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree."
Revelation,7,2,"Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:"
Revelation,7,3,“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”
Revelation,7,4,"Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel."
Revelation,7,5,"From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000,"
Revelation,7,6,"from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,"
Revelation,7,7,"from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,"
Revelation,7,8,"from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000."
Revelation,7,9,"After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands."
Revelation,7,10,"And they cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”"
Revelation,7,11,"All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,"
Revelation,7,12,saying: “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”
Revelation,7,13,"Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?”"
Revelation,7,14,"I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Revelation,7,15,"Therefore, “they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence."
Revelation,7,16,"‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,’ nor any scorching heat."
Revelation,7,17,For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”
Revelation,8,1,"When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
Revelation,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."
Revelation,8,3,"Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people, on the golden altar in front of the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went up before God from the angel’s hand."
Revelation,8,5,"Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake."
Revelation,8,6,Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
Revelation,8,7,"The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up."
Revelation,8,8,"The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,"
Revelation,8,9,"a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation,8,10,"The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water—"
Revelation,8,11,"the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night."
Revelation,8,13,"As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”"
Revelation,9,1,"The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss."
Revelation,9,2,"When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss."
Revelation,9,3,And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.
Revelation,9,4,"They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
Revelation,9,5,They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.
Revelation,9,6,"During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them."
Revelation,9,7,"The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces."
Revelation,9,8,"Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth."
Revelation,9,9,"They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle."
Revelation,9,10,"They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months."
Revelation,9,11,"They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer)."
Revelation,9,12,The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.
Revelation,9,13,"The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God."
Revelation,9,14,"It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”"
Revelation,9,15,And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
Revelation,9,16,The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.
Revelation,9,17,"The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur."
Revelation,9,18,"A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths."
Revelation,9,19,"The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury."
Revelation,9,20,"The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk."
Revelation,9,21,"Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts."
Revelation,10,1,"Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars."
Revelation,10,2,"He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,"
Revelation,10,3,"and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke."
Revelation,10,4,"And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.”"
Revelation,10,5,Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
Revelation,10,6,"And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay!"
Revelation,10,7,"But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.”"
Revelation,10,8,"Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”"
Revelation,10,9,"So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’”"
Revelation,10,10,"I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour."
Revelation,10,11,"Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.”"
Revelation,11,1,"I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers."
Revelation,11,2,"But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months."
Revelation,11,3,"And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”"
Revelation,11,4,"They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth.”"
Revelation,11,5,"If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die."
Revelation,11,6,They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
Revelation,11,7,"Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them."
Revelation,11,8,Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation,11,9,"For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial."
Revelation,11,10,"The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth."
Revelation,11,11,"But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them."
Revelation,11,12,"Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on."
Revelation,11,13,"At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."
Revelation,11,14,The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.
Revelation,11,15,"The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.”"
Revelation,11,16,"And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,"
Revelation,11,17,"saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign."
Revelation,11,18,"The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small— and for destroying those who destroy the earth.”"
Revelation,11,19,"Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm."
Revelation,12,1,"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head."
Revelation,12,2,She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
Revelation,12,3,Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads.
Revelation,12,4,"Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born."
Revelation,12,5,"She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne."
Revelation,12,6,"The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days."
Revelation,12,7,"Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back."
Revelation,12,8,"But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven."
Revelation,12,9,"The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him."
Revelation,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down."
Revelation,12,11,They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Revelation,12,12,"Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”"
Revelation,12,13,"When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child."
Revelation,12,14,"The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach."
Revelation,12,15,"Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent."
Revelation,12,16,But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
Revelation,12,17,Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
Revelation,13,1,"The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name."
Revelation,13,2,"The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority."
Revelation,13,3,"One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast."
Revelation,13,4,"People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”"
Revelation,13,5,The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.
Revelation,13,6,"It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven."
Revelation,13,7,"It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation."
Revelation,13,8,"All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world."
Revelation,13,9,"Whoever has ears, let them hear."
Revelation,13,10,"“If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.” This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people."
Revelation,13,11,"Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon."
Revelation,13,12,"It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed."
Revelation,13,13,"And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people."
Revelation,13,14,"Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived."
Revelation,13,15,"The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed."
Revelation,13,16,"It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,"
Revelation,13,17,"so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name."
Revelation,13,18,"This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666."
Revelation,14,1,"Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads."
Revelation,14,2,And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
Revelation,14,3,"And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth."
Revelation,14,4,"These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb."
Revelation,14,5,No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
Revelation,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people."
Revelation,14,7,"He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.”"
Revelation,14,8,"A second angel followed and said, “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,’ which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.”"
Revelation,14,9,"A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand,"
Revelation,14,10,"they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb."
Revelation,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”"
Revelation,14,12,This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus.
Revelation,14,13,"Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”"
Revelation,14,14,"I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand."
Revelation,14,15,"Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”"
Revelation,14,16,"So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested."
Revelation,14,17,"Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle."
Revelation,14,18,"Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.”"
Revelation,14,19,"The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath."
Revelation,14,20,"They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia."
Revelation,15,1,"I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed."
Revelation,15,2,"And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God"
Revelation,15,3,"and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: “Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations."
Revelation,15,4,"Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”"
Revelation,15,5,"After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple—that is, the tabernacle of the covenant law—and it was opened."
Revelation,15,6,"Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests."
Revelation,15,7,"Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever."
Revelation,15,8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed."
Revelation,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”"
Revelation,16,2,"The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image."
Revelation,16,3,"The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died."
Revelation,16,4,"The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood."
Revelation,16,5,"Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: “You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were;"
Revelation,16,6,"for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”"
Revelation,16,7,"And I heard the altar respond: “Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments.”"
Revelation,16,8,"The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire."
Revelation,16,9,"They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him."
Revelation,16,10,"The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony"
Revelation,16,11,"and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done."
Revelation,16,12,"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East."
Revelation,16,13,"Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
Revelation,16,14,"They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty."
Revelation,16,15,"“Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.”"
Revelation,16,16,Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
Revelation,16,17,"The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!”"
Revelation,16,18,"Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake."
Revelation,16,19,"The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath."
Revelation,16,20,Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found.
Revelation,16,21,"From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible."
Revelation,17,1,"One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters."
Revelation,17,2,"With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.”"
Revelation,17,3,Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation,17,4,"The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries."
Revelation,17,5,The name written on her forehead was a mystery: BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
Revelation,17,6,"I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished."
Revelation,17,7,"Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation,17,8,"The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come."
Revelation,17,9,“This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.
Revelation,17,10,"They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while."
Revelation,17,11,"The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction."
Revelation,17,12,"“The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast."
Revelation,17,13,They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation,17,14,"They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.”"
Revelation,17,15,"Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages."
Revelation,17,16,The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
Revelation,17,17,"For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled."
Revelation,17,18,The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
Revelation,18,1,"After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor."
Revelation,18,2,"With a mighty voice he shouted: “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’ She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal."
Revelation,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”"
Revelation,18,4,"Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “‘Come out of her, my people,’ so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;"
Revelation,18,5,"for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes."
Revelation,18,6,Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Pour her a double portion from her own cup.
Revelation,18,7,"Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, ‘I sit enthroned as queen. I am not a widow; I will never mourn.’"
Revelation,18,8,"Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her."
Revelation,18,9,"“When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her."
Revelation,18,10,"Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: “‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, you mighty city of Babylon! In one hour your doom has come!’"
Revelation,18,11,“The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes anymore—
Revelation,18,12,"cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;"
Revelation,18,13,"cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human beings sold as slaves."
Revelation,18,14,"“They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’"
Revelation,18,15,"The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn"
Revelation,18,16,"and cry out: “‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!"
Revelation,18,17,"In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ “Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off."
Revelation,18,18,"When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’"
Revelation,18,19,"They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: “‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!’"
Revelation,18,20,"“Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you.”"
Revelation,18,21,"Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: “With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again."
Revelation,18,22,"The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No worker of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again."
Revelation,18,23,The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world’s important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
Revelation,18,24,"In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people, of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”"
Revelation,19,1,"After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,"
Revelation,19,2,for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”
Revelation,19,3,And again they shouted: “Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”
Revelation,19,4,"The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: “Amen, Hallelujah!”"
Revelation,19,5,"Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both great and small!”"
Revelation,19,6,"Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: “Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns."
Revelation,19,7,"Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready."
Revelation,19,8,"Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.” (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)"
Revelation,19,9,"Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!” And he added, “These are the true words of God.”"
Revelation,19,10,"At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.”"
Revelation,19,11,"I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war."
Revelation,19,12,"His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself."
Revelation,19,13,"He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God."
Revelation,19,14,"The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean."
Revelation,19,15,Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.” He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
Revelation,19,16,On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
Revelation,19,17,"And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God,"
Revelation,19,18,"so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”"
Revelation,19,19,Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.
Revelation,19,20,"But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur."
Revelation,19,21,"The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh."
Revelation,20,1,"And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain."
Revelation,20,2,"He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,3,"He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time."
Revelation,20,4,I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
Revelation,20,5,(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
Revelation,20,6,"Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,7,"When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison"
Revelation,20,8,and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
Revelation,20,9,"They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them."
Revelation,20,10,"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
Revelation,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them."
Revelation,20,12,"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books."
Revelation,20,13,"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done."
Revelation,20,14,Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
Revelation,20,15,Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
Revelation,21,1,"Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea."
Revelation,21,2,"I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband."
Revelation,21,3,"And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God."
Revelation,21,4,"‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”"
Revelation,21,5,"He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”"
Revelation,21,6,"He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life."
Revelation,21,7,"Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children."
Revelation,21,8,"But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”"
Revelation,21,9,"One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”"
Revelation,21,10,"And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."
Revelation,21,11,"It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal."
Revelation,21,12,"It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel."
Revelation,21,13,"There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west."
Revelation,21,14,"The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
Revelation,21,15,"The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls."
Revelation,21,16,"The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long."
Revelation,21,17,"The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick."
Revelation,21,18,"The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass."
Revelation,21,19,"The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,"
Revelation,21,20,"the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst."
Revelation,21,21,"The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass."
Revelation,21,22,"I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."
Revelation,21,23,"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp."
Revelation,21,24,"The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it."
Revelation,21,25,"On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there."
Revelation,21,26,The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
Revelation,21,27,"Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life."
Revelation,22,1,"Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb"
Revelation,22,2,"down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations."
Revelation,22,3,"No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him."
Revelation,22,4,"They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads."
Revelation,22,5,"There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever."
Revelation,22,6,"The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.”"
Revelation,22,7,"“Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll.”"
Revelation,22,8,"I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me."
Revelation,22,9,"But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!”"
Revelation,22,10,"Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near."
Revelation,22,11,Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy.”
Revelation,22,12,"“Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done."
Revelation,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."
Revelation,22,14,"“Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city."
Revelation,22,15,"Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood."
Revelation,22,16,"“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”"
Revelation,22,17,"The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life."
Revelation,22,18,"I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll."
Revelation,22,19,"And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll."
Revelation,22,20,"He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus."
Revelation,22,21,The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.
Job,1,1,In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
Job,1,2,"He had seven sons and three daughters,"
Job,1,3,"and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East."
Job,1,4,"His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them."
Job,1,5,"When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom."
Job,1,6,"One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them."
Job,1,7,"The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”"
Job,1,8,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”"
Job,1,9,“Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied.
Job,1,10,"“Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land."
Job,1,11,"But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”"
Job,1,12,"The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD."
Job,1,13,"One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,14,"a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,"
Job,1,15,"and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,16,"While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,17,"While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,18,"While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house,"
Job,1,19,"when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
Job,1,20,"At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship"
Job,1,21,"and said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.”"
Job,1,22,"In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing."
Job,2,1,"On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him."
Job,2,2,"And the LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”"
Job,2,3,"Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.”"
Job,2,4,“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life.
Job,2,5,"But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”"
Job,2,6,"The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”"
Job,2,7,So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
Job,2,8,Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”"
Job,2,10,"He replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said."
Job,2,11,"When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him."
Job,2,12,"When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads."
Job,2,13,"Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was."
Job,3,1,"After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth."
Job,3,2,He said:
Job,3,3,"“May the day of my birth perish, and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’"
Job,3,4,That day—may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine on it.
Job,3,5,May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm it.
Job,3,6,That night—may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
Job,3,7,May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
Job,3,8,"May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan."
Job,3,9,"May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,"
Job,3,10,for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
Job,3,11,"“Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?"
Job,3,12,Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
Job,3,13,For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
Job,3,14,"with kings and rulers of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,"
Job,3,15,"with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver."
Job,3,16,"Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?"
Job,3,17,"There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest."
Job,3,18,Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout.
Job,3,19,"The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners."
Job,3,20,"“Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,"
Job,3,21,"to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,"
Job,3,22,who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
Job,3,23,"Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water.
Job,3,25,What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
Job,3,26,"I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil.”"
Job,4,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job,4,2,"“If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands."
Job,4,4,Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
Job,4,5,"But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed."
Job,4,6,Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
Job,4,7,"“Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?"
Job,4,8,"As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it."
Job,4,9,At the breath of God they perish; at the blast of his anger they are no more.
Job,4,10,"The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken."
Job,4,11,"The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered."
Job,4,12,"“A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it."
Job,4,13,"Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on people,"
Job,4,14,fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
Job,4,15,"A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end."
Job,4,16,"It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:"
Job,4,17,‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?
Job,4,18,"If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,"
Job,4,19,"how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!"
Job,4,20,"Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever."
Job,4,21,"Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’"
Job,5,1,"“Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?"
Job,5,2,"Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple."
Job,5,3,"I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed."
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender."
Job,5,5,"The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth."
Job,5,6,"For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground."
Job,5,7,Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
Job,5,8,"“But if I were you, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him."
Job,5,9,"He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted."
Job,5,10,He provides rain for the earth; he sends water on the countryside.
Job,5,11,"The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety."
Job,5,12,"He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success."
Job,5,13,"He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away."
Job,5,14,Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
Job,5,15,He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
Job,5,16,"So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth."
Job,5,17,“Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
Job,5,18,"For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal."
Job,5,19,From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will touch you.
Job,5,20,"In famine he will deliver you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword."
Job,5,21,"You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes."
Job,5,22,"You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the wild animals."
Job,5,23,"For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you."
Job,5,24,You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
Job,5,25,"You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season."
Job,5,27,"“We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself.”"
Job,6,1,Then Job replied:
Job,6,2,“If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
Job,6,3,It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas— no wonder my words have been impetuous.
Job,6,4,"The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God’s terrors are marshaled against me."
Job,6,5,"Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?"
Job,6,6,"Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow?"
Job,6,7,I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.
Job,6,8,"“Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,"
Job,6,9,"that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut off my life!"
Job,6,10,Then I would still have this consolation— my joy in unrelenting pain— that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job,6,11,"“What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?"
Job,6,12,Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
Job,6,13,"Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?"
Job,6,14,“Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow"
Job,6,16,"when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,"
Job,6,17,"but that stop flowing in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels."
Job,6,18,Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go off into the wasteland and perish.
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope."
Job,6,20,"They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed."
Job,6,21,Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
Job,6,22,"Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,"
Job,6,23,"deliver me from the hand of the enemy, rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’?"
Job,6,24,"“Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong."
Job,6,25,How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
Job,6,26,"Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat my desperate words as wind?"
Job,6,27,You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.
Job,6,28,“But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
Job,6,29,"Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake."
Job,6,30,Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?
Job,7,1,“Do not mortals have hard service on earth? Are not their days like those of hired laborers?
Job,7,2,"Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,"
Job,7,3,"so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down I think, ‘How long before I get up?’ The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn."
Job,7,5,"My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering."
Job,7,6,"“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and they come to an end without hope."
Job,7,7,"Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again."
Job,7,8,"The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more."
Job,7,9,"As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so one who goes down to the grave does not return."
Job,7,10,He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.
Job,7,11,"“Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
Job,7,12,"Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?"
Job,7,13,"When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,"
Job,7,14,"even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,"
Job,7,15,"so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine."
Job,7,16,I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
Job,7,17,"“What is mankind that you make so much of them, that you give them so much attention,"
Job,7,18,that you examine them every morning and test them every moment?
Job,7,19,"Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?"
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what have I done to you, you who see everything we do? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?"
Job,7,21,"Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more.”"
Job,8,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
Job,8,2,“How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
Job,8,3,Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
Job,8,4,"When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin."
Job,8,5,"But if you will seek God earnestly and plead with the Almighty,"
Job,8,6,"if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your prosperous state."
Job,8,7,"Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be."
Job,8,8,"“Ask the former generation and find out what their ancestors learned,"
Job,8,9,"for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow."
Job,8,10,Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
Job,8,11,Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
Job,8,12,"While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass."
Job,8,13,Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.
Job,8,14,What they trust in is fragile; what they rely on is a spider’s web.
Job,8,15,"They lean on the web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold."
Job,8,16,"They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;"
Job,8,17,it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
Job,8,18,"But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, ‘I never saw you.’"
Job,8,19,"Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow."
Job,8,20,“Surely God does not reject one who is blameless or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
Job,8,21,He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
Job,8,22,"Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more.”"
Job,9,1,Then Job replied:
Job,9,2,"“Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God?"
Job,9,3,"Though they wished to dispute with him, they could not answer him one time out of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?"
Job,9,5,He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
Job,9,6,He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
Job,9,7,He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
Job,9,8,He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
Job,9,9,"He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south."
Job,9,10,"He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted."
Job,9,11,"When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him."
Job,9,12,"If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’"
Job,9,13,God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
Job,9,14,“How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
Job,9,15,"Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy."
Job,9,16,"Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing."
Job,9,17,He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
Job,9,18,He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
Job,9,19,"If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him?"
Job,9,20,"Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty."
Job,9,21,"“Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life."
Job,9,22,"It is all the same; that is why I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’"
Job,9,23,"When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?"
Job,9,25,“My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
Job,9,26,"They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey."
Job,9,27,"If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,’"
Job,9,28,"I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29,"Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?"
Job,9,30,"Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with cleansing powder,"
Job,9,31,you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.
Job,9,32,"“He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court."
Job,9,33,"If only there were someone to mediate between us, someone to bring us together,"
Job,9,34,"someone to remove God’s rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more."
Job,9,35,"Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot."
Job,10,1,“I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"I say to God: Do not declare me guilty, but tell me what charges you have against me."
Job,10,3,"Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the plans of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?
Job,10,5,"Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a strong man,"
Job,10,6,that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin—
Job,10,7,though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
Job,10,8,“Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?
Job,10,9,Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?
Job,10,10,"Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,"
Job,10,11,clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?
Job,10,12,"You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit."
Job,10,13,"“But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:"
Job,10,14,"If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished."
Job,10,15,"If I am guilty—woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction."
Job,10,16,"If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me."
Job,10,17,You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.
Job,10,18,“Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.
Job,10,19,"If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!"
Job,10,20,Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment’s joy
Job,10,21,"before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and utter darkness,"
Job,10,22,"to the land of deepest night, of utter darkness and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”"
Job,11,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
Job,11,2,“Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?
Job,11,3,Will your idle talk reduce others to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
Job,11,4,"You say to God, ‘My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.’"
Job,11,5,"Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you"
Job,11,6,"and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin."
Job,11,7,“Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
Job,11,8,They are higher than the heavens above—what can you do? They are deeper than the depths below—what can you know?
Job,11,9,Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
Job,11,10,"“If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?"
Job,11,11,"Surely he recognizes deceivers; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?"
Job,11,12,But the witless can no more become wise than a wild donkey’s colt can be born human.
Job,11,13,"“Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,"
Job,11,14,"if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,"
Job,11,15,"then, free of fault, you will lift up your face; you will stand firm and without fear."
Job,11,16,"You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by."
Job,11,17,"Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning."
Job,11,18,"You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp.”"
Job,12,1,Then Job replied:
Job,12,2,"“Doubtless you are the only people who matter, and wisdom will die with you!"
Job,12,3,But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?
Job,12,4,"“I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God and he answered— a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!"
Job,12,5,Those who are at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
Job,12,6,"The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure— those God has in his hand."
Job,12,7,"“But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you;"
Job,12,8,"or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish in the sea inform you."
Job,12,9,Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
Job,12,10,In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.
Job,12,11,Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
Job,12,12,Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?
Job,12,13,“To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.
Job,12,14,What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; those he imprisons cannot be released.
Job,12,15,"If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land."
Job,12,16,To him belong strength and insight; both deceived and deceiver are his.
Job,12,17,He leads rulers away stripped and makes fools of judges.
Job,12,18,He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.
Job,12,19,He leads priests away stripped and overthrows officials long established.
Job,12,20,He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.
Job,12,21,He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
Job,12,22,He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings utter darkness into the light.
Job,12,23,"He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them."
Job,12,24,He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he makes them wander in a trackless waste.
Job,12,25,They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.
Job,13,1,"“My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you."
Job,13,3,But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.
Job,13,4,"You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!"
Job,13,5,"If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom."
Job,13,6,Hear now my argument; listen to the pleas of my lips.
Job,13,7,Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?
Job,13,8,Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?
Job,13,9,Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive a mortal?
Job,13,10,He would surely call you to account if you secretly showed partiality.
Job,13,11,Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?
Job,13,12,Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
Job,13,13,“Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.
Job,13,14,Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?
Job,13,15,"Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face."
Job,13,16,"Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless person would dare come before him!"
Job,13,17,Listen carefully to what I say; let my words ring in your ears.
Job,13,18,"Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated."
Job,13,19,"Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die."
Job,13,20,"“Only grant me these two things, God, and then I will not hide from you:"
Job,13,21,"Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors."
Job,13,22,"Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply to me."
Job,13,23,How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.
Job,13,24,Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?
Job,13,25,Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?
Job,13,26,For you write down bitter things against me and make me reap the sins of my youth.
Job,13,27,You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.
Job,13,28,"“So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths."
Job,14,1,"“Mortals, born of woman, are of few days and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,"They spring up like flowers and wither away; like fleeting shadows, they do not endure."
Job,14,3,Do you fix your eye on them? Will you bring them before you for judgment?
Job,14,4,Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!
Job,14,5,A person’s days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.
Job,14,6,"So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired laborer."
Job,14,7,"“At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail."
Job,14,8,"Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,"
Job,14,9,yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.
Job,14,10,But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.
Job,14,11,"As the water of a lake dries up or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,"
Job,14,12,"so he lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, people will not awake or be roused from their sleep."
Job,14,13,“If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!
Job,14,14,"If someone dies, will they live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come."
Job,14,15,You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.
Job,14,16,Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.
Job,14,17,My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.
Job,14,18,"“But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,"
Job,14,19,"as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy a person’s hope."
Job,14,20,"You overpower them once for all, and they are gone; you change their countenance and send them away."
Job,14,21,"If their children are honored, they do not know it; if their offspring are brought low, they do not see it."
Job,14,22,They feel but the pain of their own bodies and mourn only for themselves.”
Job,15,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job,15,2,“Would a wise person answer with empty notions or fill their belly with the hot east wind?
Job,15,3,"Would they argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?"
Job,15,4,But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.
Job,15,5,Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
Job,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,7,“Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
Job,15,8,Do you listen in on God’s council? Do you have a monopoly on wisdom?
Job,15,9,What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?
Job,15,10,"The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father."
Job,15,11,"Are God’s consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?"
Job,15,12,"Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,"
Job,15,13,so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?
Job,15,14,"“What are mortals, that they could be pure, or those born of woman, that they could be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,"
Job,15,16,"how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt, who drink up evil like water!"
Job,15,17,"“Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,"
Job,15,18,"what the wise have declared, hiding nothing received from their ancestors"
Job,15,19,(to whom alone the land was given when no foreigners moved among them):
Job,15,20,"All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless man through all the years stored up for him."
Job,15,21,"Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him."
Job,15,22,He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness; he is marked for the sword.
Job,15,23,He wanders about for food like a vulture; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
Job,15,24,"Distress and anguish fill him with terror; troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,"
Job,15,25,"because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,"
Job,15,26,"defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield."
Job,15,27,"“Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,"
Job,15,28,"he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble."
Job,15,29,"He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land."
Job,15,30,"He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away."
Job,15,31,"Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return."
Job,15,32,"Before his time he will wither, and his branches will not flourish."
Job,15,33,"He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms."
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes."
Job,15,35,They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit.”
Job,16,1,Then Job replied:
Job,16,2,"“I have heard many things like these; you are miserable comforters, all of you!"
Job,16,3,Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you."
Job,16,5,But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
Job,16,6,"“Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away."
Job,16,7,"Surely, God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household."
Job,16,8,You have shriveled me up—and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.
Job,16,9,God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
Job,16,10,People open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.
Job,16,11,God has turned me over to the ungodly and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
Job,16,12,"All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;"
Job,16,13,"his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground."
Job,16,14,Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.
Job,16,15,“I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.
Job,16,16,"My face is red with weeping, dark shadows ring my eyes;"
Job,16,17,yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.
Job,16,18,"“Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!"
Job,16,19,Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
Job,16,20,My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;
Job,16,21,on behalf of a man he pleads with God as one pleads for a friend.
Job,16,22,“Only a few years will pass before I take the path of no return.
Job,17,1,"My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me."
Job,17,2,Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
Job,17,3,"“Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?"
Job,17,4,You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.
Job,17,5,"If anyone denounces their friends for reward, the eyes of their children will fail."
Job,17,6,"“God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit."
Job,17,7,My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.
Job,17,8,The upright are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.
Job,17,9,"Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger."
Job,17,10,"“But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days have passed, my plans are shattered. Yet the desires of my heart"
Job,17,12,turn night into day; in the face of the darkness light is near.
Job,17,13,"If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in the realm of darkness,"
Job,17,14,"if I say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’"
Job,17,15,where then is my hope— who can see any hope for me?
Job,17,16,Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?”
Job,18,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
Job,18,2,"“When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk."
Job,18,3,Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?
Job,18,4,"You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?"
Job,18,5,“The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.
Job,18,6,The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.
Job,18,7,The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.
Job,18,8,His feet thrust him into a net; he wanders into its mesh.
Job,18,9,A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.
Job,18,10,A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.
Job,18,11,Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.
Job,18,12,Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.
Job,18,13,It eats away parts of his skin; death’s firstborn devours his limbs.
Job,18,14,He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.
Job,18,15,Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
Job,18,16,His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.
Job,18,17,The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.
Job,18,18,He is driven from light into the realm of darkness and is banished from the world.
Job,18,19,"He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived."
Job,18,20,People of the west are appalled at his fate; those of the east are seized with horror.
Job,18,21,Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who does not know God.”
Job,19,1,Then Job replied:
Job,19,2,“How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
Job,19,3,Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.
Job,19,4,"If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone."
Job,19,5,"If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,"
Job,19,6,then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.
Job,19,7,"“Though I cry, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice."
Job,19,8,He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
Job,19,9,He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
Job,19,10,He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.
Job,19,11,His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.
Job,19,12,His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
Job,19,13,“He has alienated my family from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
Job,19,14,My relatives have gone away; my closest friends have forgotten me.
Job,19,15,My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner; they look on me as on a stranger.
Job,19,16,"I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth."
Job,19,17,My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family.
Job,19,18,"Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me."
Job,19,19,All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.
Job,19,20,I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.
Job,19,21,"“Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me."
Job,19,22,Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
Job,19,23,"“Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,"
Job,19,24,"that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!"
Job,19,25,"I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth."
Job,19,26,"And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;"
Job,19,27,"I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!"
Job,19,28,"“If you say, ‘How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him,’"
Job,19,29,"you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment.”"
Job,20,1,Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
Job,20,2,“My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.
Job,20,3,"I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply."
Job,20,4,"“Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since mankind was placed on the earth,"
Job,20,5,"that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment."
Job,20,6,"Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,"
Job,20,7,"he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’"
Job,20,8,"Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night."
Job,20,9,The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.
Job,20,10,His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.
Job,20,11,The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.
Job,20,12,"“Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,"
Job,20,13,"though he cannot bear to let it go and lets it linger in his mouth,"
Job,20,14,yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.
Job,20,15,He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.
Job,20,16,He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.
Job,20,17,"He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream."
Job,20,18,What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.
Job,20,19,For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.
Job,20,20,“Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.
Job,20,21,Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.
Job,20,22,"In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him."
Job,20,23,"When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows on him."
Job,20,24,"Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him."
Job,20,25,"He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;"
Job,20,26,total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.
Job,20,28,"A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath."
Job,20,29,"Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God.”"
Job,21,1,Then Job replied:
Job,21,2,“Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.
Job,21,3,"Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,“Is my complaint directed to a human being? Why should I not be impatient?
Job,21,5,Look at me and be appalled; clap your hand over your mouth.
Job,21,6,"When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body."
Job,21,7,"Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?"
Job,21,8,"They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not on them.
Job,21,10,Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
Job,21,11,They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.
Job,21,12,They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre; they make merry to the sound of the pipe.
Job,21,13,They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.
Job,21,14,"Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways."
Job,21,15,"Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?’"
Job,21,16,"But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked."
Job,21,17,"“Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?"
Job,21,18,"How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?"
Job,21,19,"It is said, ‘God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.’ Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it!"
Job,21,20,Let their own eyes see their destruction; let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job,21,21,For what do they care about the families they leave behind when their allotted months come to an end?
Job,21,22,"“Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?"
Job,21,23,"One person dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,"
Job,21,24,"well nourished in body, bones rich with marrow."
Job,21,25,"Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good."
Job,21,26,"Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both."
Job,21,27,"“I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me."
Job,21,28,"You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great, the tents where the wicked lived?’"
Job,21,29,Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts—
Job,21,30,"that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity, that they are delivered from the day of wrath?"
Job,21,31,Who denounces their conduct to their face? Who repays them for what they have done?
Job,21,32,"They are carried to the grave, and watch is kept over their tombs."
Job,21,33,"The soil in the valley is sweet to them; everyone follows after them, and a countless throng goes before them."
Job,21,34,“So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!”
Job,22,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job,22,2,“Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise person benefit him?
Job,22,3,What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?
Job,22,4,“Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?
Job,22,5,Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?
Job,22,6,"You demanded security from your relatives for no reason; you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked."
Job,22,7,"You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,"
Job,22,8,"though you were a powerful man, owning land— an honored man, living on it."
Job,22,9,And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.
Job,22,10,"That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,"
Job,22,11,"why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you."
Job,22,12,“Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!
Job,22,13,"Yet you say, ‘What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’"
Job,22,15,Will you keep to the old path that the wicked have trod?
Job,22,16,"They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood."
Job,22,17,"They said to God, ‘Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?’"
Job,22,18,"Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked."
Job,22,19,"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,"
Job,22,20,"‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.’"
Job,22,21,“Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.
Job,22,22,Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.
Job,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent"
Job,22,24,"and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,"
Job,22,25,"then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you."
Job,22,26,Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.
Job,22,27,"You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows."
Job,22,28,"What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways."
Job,22,29,"When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then he will save the downcast."
Job,22,30,"He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”"
Job,23,1,Then Job replied:
Job,23,2,“Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
Job,23,3,If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!
Job,23,4,I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job,23,5,"I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say to me."
Job,23,6,"Would he vigorously oppose me? No, he would not press charges against me."
Job,23,7,"There the upright can establish their innocence before him, and there I would be delivered forever from my judge."
Job,23,8,"“But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him."
Job,23,9,"When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him."
Job,23,10,"But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.
Job,23,12,I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
Job,23,13,"“But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases."
Job,23,14,"He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store."
Job,23,15,"That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him."
Job,23,16,God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
Job,23,17,"Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face."
Job,24,1,“Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
Job,24,2,There are those who move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.
Job,24,3,They drive away the orphan’s donkey and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
Job,24,4,They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
Job,24,5,"Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children."
Job,24,6,They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold."
Job,24,8,They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
Job,24,9,The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
Job,24,10,"Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry."
Job,24,11,"They crush olives among the terraces; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing."
Job,24,13,"“There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths."
Job,24,14,"When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up, kills the poor and needy, and in the night steals forth like a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, ‘No eye will see me,’ and he keeps his face concealed."
Job,24,16,"In the dark, thieves break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light."
Job,24,17,"For all of them, midnight is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness."
Job,24,18,"“Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards."
Job,24,19,"As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned."
Job,24,20,"The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; the wicked are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree."
Job,24,21,"They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow they show no kindness."
Job,24,22,"But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life."
Job,24,23,"He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways."
Job,24,24,"For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain."
Job,24,25,"“If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?”"
Job,25,1,Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
Job,25,2,“Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
Job,25,3,Can his forces be numbered? On whom does his light not rise?
Job,25,4,How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
Job,25,5,"If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,"
Job,25,6,"how much less a mortal, who is but a maggot— a human being, who is only a worm!”"
Job,26,1,Then Job replied:
Job,26,2,“How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!
Job,26,3,What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!
Job,26,4,Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?
Job,26,5,"“The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them."
Job,26,6,The realm of the dead is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.
Job,26,7,He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.
Job,26,8,"He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight."
Job,26,9,"He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it."
Job,26,10,He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.
Job,26,11,"The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke."
Job,26,12,By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
Job,26,13,By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
Job,26,14,And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?”
Job,27,1,And Job continued his discourse:
Job,27,2,"“As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,"
Job,27,3,"as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"my lips will not say anything wicked, and my tongue will not utter lies."
Job,27,5,"I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity."
Job,27,6,I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.
Job,27,7,"“May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like the unjust!"
Job,27,8,"For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, when God takes away their life?"
Job,27,9,Does God listen to their cry when distress comes upon them?
Job,27,10,Will they find delight in the Almighty? Will they call on God at all times?
Job,27,11,“I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
Job,27,12,You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?
Job,27,13,"“Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:"
Job,27,14,"However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat."
Job,27,15,"The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them."
Job,27,16,"Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,"
Job,27,17,"what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver."
Job,27,18,"The house he builds is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman."
Job,27,19,"He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.
Job,27,21,"The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place."
Job,27,22,It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
Job,27,23,It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.”
Job,28,1,There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore."
Job,28,3,Mortals put an end to the darkness; they search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.
Job,28,4,"Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, in places untouched by human feet; far from other people they dangle and sway."
Job,28,5,"The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;"
Job,28,6,"lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold."
Job,28,7,"No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon’s eye has seen it."
Job,28,8,"Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there."
Job,28,9,People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains.
Job,28,10,They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures.
Job,28,11,They search the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light.
Job,28,12,But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?
Job,28,13,No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,"The deep says, “It is not in me”; the sea says, “It is not with me.”"
Job,28,15,"It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or lapis lazuli."
Job,28,17,"Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold."
Job,28,18,Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
Job,28,19,The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.
Job,28,20,Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?
Job,28,21,"It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and Death say, “Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”"
Job,28,23,"God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,"
Job,28,24,for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
Job,28,25,"When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,"
Job,28,26,"when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,"
Job,28,27,then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.
Job,28,28,"And he said to the human race, “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.”"
Job,29,1,Job continued his discourse:
Job,29,2,"“How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,"
Job,29,3,when his lamp shone on my head and by his light I walked through darkness!
Job,29,4,"Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house,"
Job,29,5,"when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,"
Job,29,6,when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.
Job,29,7,"“When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,"
Job,29,8,the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;
Job,29,9,the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;
Job,29,10,"the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths."
Job,29,11,"Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,"
Job,29,12,"because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist them."
Job,29,13,The one who was dying blessed me; I made the widow’s heart sing.
Job,29,14,I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.
Job,29,15,I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
Job,29,16,I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.
Job,29,17,I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.
Job,29,18,"“I thought, ‘I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand."
Job,29,19,"My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches."
Job,29,20,My glory will not fade; the bow will be ever new in my hand.’
Job,29,21,"“People listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel."
Job,29,22,"After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears."
Job,29,23,They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.
Job,29,24,"When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them."
Job,29,25,I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.
Job,30,1,"“But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs."
Job,30,2,"Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?"
Job,30,3,"Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night."
Job,30,4,"In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom bush."
Job,30,5,"They were banished from human society, shouted at as if they were thieves."
Job,30,6,"They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground."
Job,30,7,They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.
Job,30,8,"A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land."
Job,30,9,“And now those young men mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.
Job,30,10,They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
Job,30,11,"Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence."
Job,30,12,"On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me."
Job,30,13,"They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me. ‘No one can help him,’ they say."
Job,30,14,They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.
Job,30,15,"Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud."
Job,30,16,“And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.
Job,30,17,Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.
Job,30,18,In his great power God becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment.
Job,30,19,"He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"“I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me."
Job,30,21,You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.
Job,30,22,You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.
Job,30,23,"I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living."
Job,30,24,“Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.
Job,30,25,Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
Job,30,26,"Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness."
Job,30,27,The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.
Job,30,28,"I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help."
Job,30,29,"I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls."
Job,30,30,My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.
Job,30,31,"My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing."
Job,31,1,“I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman.
Job,31,2,"For what is our lot from God above, our heritage from the Almighty on high?"
Job,31,3,"Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?"
Job,31,4,Does he not see my ways and count my every step?
Job,31,5,“If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit—
Job,31,6,let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless—
Job,31,7,"if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,"
Job,31,8,"then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted."
Job,31,9,"“If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,"
Job,31,10,"then may my wife grind another man’s grain, and may other men sleep with her."
Job,31,11,"For that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged."
Job,31,12,It is a fire that burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest.
Job,31,13,"“If I have denied justice to any of my servants, whether male or female, when they had a grievance against me,"
Job,31,14,what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?
Job,31,15,Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?
Job,31,16,"“If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,"
Job,31,17,"if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless—"
Job,31,18,"but from my youth I reared them as a father would, and from my birth I guided the widow—"
Job,31,19,"if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or the needy without garments,"
Job,31,20,"and their hearts did not bless me for warming them with the fleece from my sheep,"
Job,31,21,"if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,"
Job,31,22,"then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint."
Job,31,23,"For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things."
Job,31,24,"“If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, ‘You are my security,’"
Job,31,25,"if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,"
Job,31,26,"if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,"
Job,31,27,"so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,"
Job,31,28,"then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high."
Job,31,29,“If I have rejoiced at my enemy’s misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him—
Job,31,30,I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against their life—
Job,31,31,"if those of my household have never said, ‘Who has not been filled with Job’s meat?’—"
Job,31,32,"but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler—"
Job,31,33,"if I have concealed my sin as people do, by hiding my guilt in my heart"
Job,31,34,because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside—
Job,31,35,"(“Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing."
Job,31,36,"Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown."
Job,31,37,I would give him an account of my every step; I would present it to him as to a ruler.)—
Job,31,38,"“if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,"
Job,31,39,"if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,"
Job,31,40,then let briers come up instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.
Job,32,1,"So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God."
Job,32,3,"He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him."
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
Job,32,5,"But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused."
Job,32,6,"So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: “I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know."
Job,32,7,"I thought, ‘Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.’"
Job,32,8,"But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding."
Job,32,9,"It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right."
Job,32,10,“Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.
Job,32,11,"I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,"
Job,32,12,I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.
Job,32,13,"Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not a man, refute him.’"
Job,32,14,"But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments."
Job,32,15,“They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.
Job,32,16,"Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?"
Job,32,17,I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.
Job,32,18,"For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;"
Job,32,19,"inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst."
Job,32,20,I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.
Job,32,21,"I will show no partiality, nor will I flatter anyone;"
Job,32,22,"for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away."
Job,33,1,"“But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say."
Job,33,2,I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.
Job,33,3,My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.
Job,33,4,The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
Job,33,5,"Answer me then, if you can; stand up and argue your case before me."
Job,33,6,I am the same as you in God’s sight; I too am a piece of clay.
Job,33,7,"No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy on you."
Job,33,8,“But you have said in my hearing— I heard the very words—
Job,33,9,"‘I am pure, I have done no wrong; I am clean and free from sin."
Job,33,10,Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.
Job,33,11,He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.’
Job,33,12,"“But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than any mortal."
Job,33,13,Why do you complain to him that he responds to no one’s words?
Job,33,14,"For God does speak—now one way, now another— though no one perceives it."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber in their beds,"
Job,33,16,"he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,"
Job,33,17,"to turn them from wrongdoing and keep them from pride,"
Job,33,18,"to preserve them from the pit, their lives from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"“Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in their bones,"
Job,33,20,so that their body finds food repulsive and their soul loathes the choicest meal.
Job,33,21,"Their flesh wastes away to nothing, and their bones, once hidden, now stick out."
Job,33,22,"They draw near to the pit, and their life to the messengers of death."
Job,33,23,"Yet if there is an angel at their side, a messenger, one out of a thousand, sent to tell them how to be upright,"
Job,33,24,"and he is gracious to that person and says to God, ‘Spare them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for them—"
Job,33,25,let their flesh be renewed like a child’s; let them be restored as in the days of their youth’—
Job,33,26,"then that person can pray to God and find favor with him, they will see God’s face and shout for joy; he will restore them to full well-being."
Job,33,27,"And they will go to others and say, ‘I have sinned, I have perverted what is right, but I did not get what I deserved."
Job,33,28,"God has delivered me from going down to the pit, and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.’"
Job,33,29,"“God does all these things to a person— twice, even three times—"
Job,33,30,"to turn them back from the pit, that the light of life may shine on them."
Job,33,31,"“Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want to vindicate you."
Job,33,33,"But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
Job,34,1,Then Elihu said:
Job,34,2,"“Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning."
Job,34,3,For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.
Job,34,4,Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
Job,34,5,"“Job says, ‘I am innocent, but God denies me justice."
Job,34,6,"Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.’"
Job,34,7,"Is there anyone like Job, who drinks scorn like water?"
Job,34,8,He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with the wicked.
Job,34,9,"For he says, ‘There is no profit in trying to please God.’"
Job,34,10,"“So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong."
Job,34,11,He repays everyone for what they have done; he brings on them what their conduct deserves.
Job,34,12,"It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice."
Job,34,13,Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,"
Job,34,15,all humanity would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
Job,34,16,"“If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say."
Job,34,17,Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
Job,34,18,"Is he not the One who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’"
Job,34,19,"who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?"
Job,34,20,"They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand."
Job,34,21,“His eyes are on the ways of mortals; he sees their every step.
Job,34,22,"There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness, where evildoers can hide."
Job,34,23,"God has no need to examine people further, that they should come before him for judgment."
Job,34,24,Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.
Job,34,25,"Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed."
Job,34,26,"He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,"
Job,34,27,because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.
Job,34,28,"They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy."
Job,34,29,"But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over individual and nation alike,"
Job,34,30,"to keep the godless from ruling, from laying snares for the people."
Job,34,31,"“Suppose someone says to God, ‘I am guilty but will offend no more."
Job,34,32,"Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.’"
Job,34,33,"Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know."
Job,34,34,"“Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,"
Job,34,35,‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’
Job,34,36,"Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!"
Job,34,37,To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
Job,35,1,Then Elihu said:
Job,35,2,"“Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am in the right, not God.’"
Job,35,3,"Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?’"
Job,35,4,“I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.
Job,35,5,Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.
Job,35,6,"If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?"
Job,35,7,"If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?"
Job,35,8,"Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself, and your righteousness only other people."
Job,35,9,“People cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
Job,35,10,"But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,who teaches us more than he teaches the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?’
Job,35,12,He does not answer when people cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
Job,35,13,"Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it."
Job,35,14,"How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,"
Job,35,15,"and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness."
Job,35,16,So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words.”
Job,36,1,Elihu continued:
Job,36,2,“Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God’s behalf.
Job,36,3,I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
Job,36,4,Be assured that my words are not false; one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
Job,36,5,"“God is mighty, but despises no one; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose."
Job,36,6,He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.
Job,36,7,He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
Job,36,8,"But if people are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,he tells them what they have done— that they have sinned arrogantly.
Job,36,10,He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
Job,36,11,"If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment."
Job,36,12,"But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,"“The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help."
Job,36,14,"They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines."
Job,36,15,But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.
Job,36,16,"“He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food."
Job,36,17,But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
Job,36,18,Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
Job,36,19,Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?
Job,36,20,"Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes."
Job,36,21,"Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction."
Job,36,22,“God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
Job,36,23,"Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, ‘You have done wrong’?"
Job,36,24,"Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song."
Job,36,25,All humanity has seen it; mortals gaze on it from afar.
Job,36,26,How great is God—beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.
Job,36,27,"“He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams;"
Job,36,28,the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.
Job,36,29,"Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?"
Job,36,30,"See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea."
Job,36,31,This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.
Job,36,32,He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
Job,36,33,His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.
Job,37,1,“At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.
Job,37,2,"Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth."
Job,37,3,He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.
Job,37,4,"After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back."
Job,37,5,God’s voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.
Job,37,6,"He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the rain shower, ‘Be a mighty downpour.’"
Job,37,7,"So that everyone he has made may know his work, he stops all people from their labor."
Job,37,8,The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.
Job,37,9,"The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds."
Job,37,10,"The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen."
Job,37,11,He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.
Job,37,12,At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.
Job,37,13,"He brings the clouds to punish people, or to water his earth and show his love."
Job,37,14,"“Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God’s wonders."
Job,37,15,Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?
Job,37,16,"Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,"
Job,37,18,"can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?"
Job,37,19,“Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
Job,37,20,Should he be told that I want to speak? Would anyone ask to be swallowed up?
Job,37,21,"Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean."
Job,37,22,Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.
Job,37,23,"The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress."
Job,37,24,"Therefore, people revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?”"
Job,38,1,Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:
Job,38,2,“Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me."
Job,38,4,"“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me, if you understand."
Job,38,5,Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
Job,38,6,"On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone—"
Job,38,7,while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?
Job,38,8,"“Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,"
Job,38,9,"when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,"
Job,38,10,"when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,"
Job,38,11,"when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt’?"
Job,38,12,"“Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,"
Job,38,13,that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
Job,38,14,The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
Job,38,15,"The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken."
Job,38,16,“Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
Job,38,18,"Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this."
Job,38,19,“What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?
Job,38,20,Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
Job,38,21,"Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!"
Job,38,22,"“Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,"
Job,38,23,"which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?"
Job,38,24,"What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,"
Job,38,26,"to water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited desert,"
Job,38,27,to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
Job,38,28,Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
Job,38,30,"when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?"
Job,38,31,“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades? Can you loosen Orion’s belt?
Job,38,32,Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?
Job,38,33,Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God’s dominion over the earth?
Job,38,34,“Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?
Job,38,35,"Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?"
Job,38,36,Who gives the ibis wisdom or gives the rooster understanding?
Job,38,37,Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
Job,38,38,when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?
Job,38,39,“Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions
Job,38,40,when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?
Job,38,41,Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
Job,39,1,“Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?
Job,39,2,Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?
Job,39,3,They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.
Job,39,4,Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.
Job,39,5,“Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied its ropes?
Job,39,6,"I gave it the wasteland as its home, the salt flats as its habitat."
Job,39,7,It laughs at the commotion in the town; it does not hear a driver’s shout.
Job,39,8,It ranges the hills for its pasture and searches for any green thing.
Job,39,9,“Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will it stay by your manger at night?
Job,39,10,Can you hold it to the furrow with a harness? Will it till the valleys behind you?
Job,39,11,Will you rely on it for its great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to it?
Job,39,12,Can you trust it to haul in your grain and bring it to your threshing floor?
Job,39,13,"“The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, though they cannot compare with the wings and feathers of the stork."
Job,39,14,"She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,"
Job,39,15,"unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them."
Job,39,16,"She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,"
Job,39,17,for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.
Job,39,18,"Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider."
Job,39,19,“Do you give the horse its strength or clothe its neck with a flowing mane?
Job,39,20,"Do you make it leap like a locust, striking terror with its proud snorting?"
Job,39,21,"It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength, and charges into the fray."
Job,39,22,"It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; it does not shy away from the sword."
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattles against its side, along with the flashing spear and lance."
Job,39,24,In frenzied excitement it eats up the ground; it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
Job,39,25,"At the blast of the trumpet it snorts, ‘Aha!’ It catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry."
Job,39,26,“Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread its wings toward the south?
Job,39,27,Does the eagle soar at your command and build its nest on high?
Job,39,28,It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is its stronghold.
Job,39,29,From there it looks for food; its eyes detect it from afar.
Job,39,30,"Its young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there it is.”"
Job,40,1,The LORD said to Job:
Job,40,2,“Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!”
Job,40,3,Then Job answered the LORD:
Job,40,4,“I am unworthy—how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.
Job,40,5,"I spoke once, but I have no answer— twice, but I will say no more.”"
Job,40,6,Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:
Job,40,7,"“Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me."
Job,40,8,“Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
Job,40,9,"Do you have an arm like God’s, and can your voice thunder like his?"
Job,40,10,"Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty."
Job,40,11,"Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at all who are proud and bring them low,"
Job,40,12,"look at all who are proud and humble them, crush the wicked where they stand."
Job,40,13,Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.
Job,40,14,Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
Job,40,15,"“Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox."
Job,40,16,"What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly!"
Job,40,17,Its tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are close-knit.
Job,40,18,"Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron."
Job,40,19,"It ranks first among the works of God, yet its Maker can approach it with his sword."
Job,40,20,"The hills bring it their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby."
Job,40,21,"Under the lotus plants it lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh."
Job,40,22,The lotuses conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround it.
Job,40,23,"A raging river does not alarm it; it is secure, though the Jordan should surge against its mouth."
Job,40,24,"Can anyone capture it by the eyes, or trap it and pierce its nose?"
Job,41,1,“Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down its tongue with a rope?
Job,41,2,Can you put a cord through its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook?
Job,41,3,Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words?
Job,41,4,Will it make an agreement with you for you to take it as your slave for life?
Job,41,5,Can you make a pet of it like a bird or put it on a leash for the young women in your house?
Job,41,6,Will traders barter for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?
Job,41,7,Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?
Job,41,8,"If you lay a hand on it, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!"
Job,41,9,Any hope of subduing it is false; the mere sight of it is overpowering.
Job,41,10,No one is fierce enough to rouse it. Who then is able to stand against me?
Job,41,11,Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
Job,41,12,"“I will not fail to speak of Leviathan’s limbs, its strength and its graceful form."
Job,41,13,Who can strip off its outer coat? Who can penetrate its double coat of armor?
Job,41,14,"Who dares open the doors of its mouth, ringed about with fearsome teeth?"
Job,41,15,Its back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;
Job,41,16,each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
Job,41,17,They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
Job,41,18,Its snorting throws out flashes of light; its eyes are like the rays of dawn.
Job,41,19,Flames stream from its mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
Job,41,20,Smoke pours from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
Job,41,21,"Its breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from its mouth."
Job,41,22,Strength resides in its neck; dismay goes before it.
Job,41,23,The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
Job,41,24,"Its chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone."
Job,41,25,"When it rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before its thrashing."
Job,41,26,"The sword that reaches it has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin."
Job,41,27,Iron it treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
Job,41,28,Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones are like chaff to it.
Job,41,29,A club seems to it but a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
Job,41,30,"Its undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge."
Job,41,31,It makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job,41,32,It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had white hair.
Job,41,33,Nothing on earth is its equal— a creature without fear.
Job,41,34,It looks down on all that are haughty; it is king over all that are proud.”
Job,42,1,Then Job replied to the LORD:
Job,42,2,“I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
Job,42,3,"You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’ Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know."
Job,42,4,"“You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.’"
Job,42,5,My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
Job,42,6,Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.”
Job,42,7,"After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has."
Job,42,8,"So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.”"
Job,42,9,"So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job’s prayer."
Job,42,10,"After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before."
Job,42,11,"All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring."
Job,42,12,"The LORD blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys."
Job,42,13,And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,14,"The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch."
Job,42,15,"Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers."
Job,42,16,"After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation."
Job,42,17,"And so Job died, an old man and full of years."
